what's it called again what's the gym called Verde Valley Brazilian Jujitsu so Verde Valley BJJ and what what town is that in Old Town cottonwood in Arizona so you essentially like invested in built a gym out there so you'd have a place to Train basically yeah that's such a smart move yeah it's kind of what you have to do right yeah otherwise you'd have to drive hours yes I mean there's megatons down south there's a bunch of places down there but they're just it's you know two-hour drive there's also Ted Osburn Osburn Jiu Jitsu has an Academy there when you decide like where you're gonna live when you decide where you gonna like decide to spend all your time like do you ever go what the fuck am I doing in the middle of nowhere in Arizona I'm maintaining peace of mind and I remind myself of that right away so that's like essential it's planned out and assess yeah just that that isolation a little bit just you know the unplug and reset I think just my introvert nature I need I need that time I need that I need that introspection I need that moment yeah because of you you are kind of an introvert but you're also kind of an extrovert I mean you're the lead singer of tool I mean it's not like I mean you could only be so introverted I do what you do so you have to kind of like fluctuate it's a balance but I need to recharge I need to unplug and go back and recharge and then I can go back on and do that a lot of people never figured that out right they just kind of burn they burn the fuck out yeah how'd you figure out to not do that first couple years of being in LA realize it was just such an energy step I needed to actually literally go someplace where there were very few people yeah that's the move right god I always keep thinking I should do that every time I go to some small town I'm like this is probably the way to live just like know the people around you who live around a few thousand people you know have a grocery store that can that can backfire - Oh totally yeah small town small town drive-on big town drama it ends up being the same thing but you actually it's not a stranger yelling at you it's your neighbor well I think the small drum is better if there's a college in town for some reason right like those places like Boulder or there's a bunch of cities like that like Bozeman Montana is a good example there's these places that are like they're not big but the university somehow and other balances out the intellectual vibe of the town I could see that yeah like Boulder yeah boulders I wonder what bowlers like now in the height and fury of social justice warrior online activism I wonder if boulders gotten weird haven't been bashing Wow cuz every place is kind of ramped up that shit yeah over the last few years you get me okay in this Jesus I'm beautiful can you hear me okay Connor sound oh man he's got Conor McGregor standing right in front of him for advice so if anything goes south Connor doesn't have his fuck you pinstripe suit on though he's got his fuck you attitude in his fists right now did you see the press conference no I that's one of those I was trying to find what's the edit to like watch that thing rather than this there's so much streaming going on I had no idea what I was looking for yeah the best but what all you want to see is Connor talking a little bit of a little bit of Floyd Mayweather responding but Connor talking there's Dana White's video feed you could watch on if we could put it up right now you want to want to listen to it why not go to Dana White's Instagram profile and then once you go to his Instagram profile go to the video that's playing in his YouTube there's like a link like on his Instagram pants Connors hilarious man he's fucking hilarious and he's laughing and having a great time and Floyd seemed like he seemed a little rattled but like how confident this guy is when they were going face to face and standing off with each other yeah give me some volume when they get face to face it go back to that listen to him talk some shit no before that go before that there you go right there right there it's good you can't even afford a zoo anymore he is there's no other way about it his little legs his little car is little here I'm gonna knock him out inside for now it's Mike my wart [Applause] wait till they get in front of each other this time John and August McGregor line I've got my own line of suits coming out if you zoom in on the pins rooibos yes fuck you look let's get this wheel to start let's have fun thank you so much everybody I appreciate it now watch with him and Floyd Mayweather get in front of each other so scoot it scoot ahead to when him and flick his Floyd gets up and says a bunch of shit and a bunch of other people say a bunch of shit Floyd look really stupid back up a little bit can you see Floyd hold up his trap is check for a hundred million look it back it up back it up to the taxman [Applause] number text yo ass I'm gonna do shit and then shut the mic up they shed his my god you going around on your face or you going out on your back now which way you want to go which way you wanna go that's right bitch they won't let ELISA night and show up you just show up okay and I'm gonna do the rest you just show up you do the race [Applause] [Applause] selling tickets [Applause] the guy all right I get I get nervous [Applause] [Applause] we should get them do you answer the riddle heads do they hurt more [Music] [Applause] this is a real fight you're dead already this is amazing do your hands hurt when it gets cold cuz Floyd's had a bunch of hand surgeries because you but you got brittle hands the hands hurt when it gets cold then they hurt when it's cold yeah I have no I I don't know enough about boxing to have any clue all I can look at from a distance is is Floyd's older he's slightly smaller he's also the greatest defensive boxer of all time right like literally of all time and Michael Jordan was arguably one of the best basketball players but put him back in the game today yeah but floor doesn't been out for that long he's still relevant I mean he's it's only been a couple of years I think was two years since his last fight against Andre Berto was it two years and then before that the Pacquiao fight you know like he's so yeah I'm saying I you know so that's that was my first look that's what you look at you go age reach all that stuff sighs watching what happened to McGregor up against Diaz having that and wasn't really ready for that larger dude to hit him yeah is that the equation but then you know maybe McGregor is no joke so he's you know but can he handle a guy who's done this a hundred times he's done more than a hundred timing Floyd's grew up doing it the thing about Floyd is I think you have an idea of what you can do to him until you get inside the the ring with them and then you realize how good he is his defense is just on another level he's just in a completely different zone all by himself his movement the way he's able to figure out what you're gonna do the weight he processes your movement throws it into his boxing computer and then before you know it he's catching you before you even know what you're doing he's just a wizard man when it comes to boxing the thing is Conor is a way bigger guy he's younger he's way stronger I mean physically stronger not just in terms of like punching power he's way stronger with punching power but he's also like stronger physically like if he gets ahold of Floyd and starts manipulating him I'm very curious to see what like his trainer John Kavanagh is a very very smart guy I know he's also worked with Paulie Malignaggi who's a world champion and one of the best box and commentators in the business he's helping Conor it's gonna be interesting you know on paper you'd have to say Floyd has a massive advantage but all this shit talking wears on a man mm-hmm that's that's a different kind of shit talking on Floyd's ever experience he hasn't had that he's got a guy telling him I can kill you easy he's like got a guy telling you there's a real fight you're dead you're dead in 20 knows he's right he knows he's right Floyd fucking knows it if Floyd he lets his ego get crazy let's have an MMA match let's go ahead and have an MMA match that's it he's a dead man yeah he's a dead man fight them in the Octagon there and worth grounds close yeah he said that he's ridiculous let him use elbows let him you just you give him one more weapon and you're fucked you tie up and you you want to do this and over the top comes an elbow and your fucking legs give out unto you one give him one more weapon give him knees knees are leg kicks look at weights it's crazy like I just think Connor I just think you need to calm down a little bit and give him a beautiful don't get many space just give him a little bit of space enough shut up Joe easy little space space sure that is the guy who makes those a bad motherfucker how you pronounce his name it's plastics a pasta cell or plastic so no but the gentleman who makes oh how long Tran I believe you know he's a bad motherfucker pretty amazing yeah it's crazy right so so accurate the big you've seen the big in where's Big E oh then we had to move him we were doing something here look at the big one oh yeah in the Tupac one guy's a wizard man that's me that's me is that guy um but I look it's a spectacle you know what what happens happens yeah I also mr. zark this is what it's all about oh yeah like whatever happens in the ring yeah whatever this that's gonna sell yeah it's gonna sell they're gonna charge a hundred bucks for pay-per-view per charge charge whoo you're not gonna pay you're gonna pay how dare you everyone listens paying if you got a hundred bucks you can fuck it have 10 people over it's 10 bucks I'm not gonna but you went pay 10 bucks to see that you're out of your fuckin mind I've actually ducks my screen but the screen at my house is so awesome that it's actually it's worth like I I have to literally I have to pay $1,000 to watch it so if you want to come over it's a hundred bucks yes a thousand dollars to watch what you mean oh he's gonna think I see what he's doing yeah do you have like one of those 100 inch L LED or LCD what is it LED or LCD LED now right I saw one of the at the store the other day at Best Buy they like a 100 inch TV like that it's fucking crazy you're looking at that thing it's almost too good yeah no no don't do that are you filming you filming a lot of shit you do it in 4k I don't know I mean all the video stuff we yeah yeah well uh when that the one the red camera first came out we had some friends were using that and they were using the the Canon for a while just filming on and I don't know what they're filming on I just know that over the last five years just insane just jump in technology for filming yeah it's been amazing not having to have like dude with like lights and some guy with on a dolly no it's like the guy's a small tiny little thing to anything doing insane insane work they have trail cams now that are in 4k so like when they're looking for animals in the woods they put these cameras up on trails they capture motion capture and then they take video 4k video and it's fucking amazing low-light video and they show the difference it was something I was looking at yesterday I'd show the difference between state of the art two years ago versus state of the art today in the exact same location exact same time it's crazy like you could see everything crystal clear its HD video from a tree a little box tied to a tree I mean it looks like a fucking movie that's pretty awesome dude you're missing out on that hiding out in the middle of nowhere Arizona not really though that's the thing it's not like when you're hiding out there you're still connected yeah it's it's we just finished our two greenhouses there we're planting them this next week so we've got full-on greenhouses on one of the sites are you totally off the grid not off the grid no but I mean that would be that'd be nice I think that's the goal I feel like you can be right with solar yeah and I've waited on solar just to see again like Amber's were what they were two years ago to today what how are the solar panels catching up because I know that that technology is insane now do you know what Elon Musk is doing he's making solar power powered roof tiles right so your whole roof is like a giant solar generator which tendo and those things is great so all you know I'm the kind of guy that waits a minute do I want to see okay one sees put those in place how do they do against tile hail how do they derive Sun that's a good point I want to see how those things last cuz I'm not gonna invest all that money and roof tiles if all of a sudden they find in a year that they that crack under Arizona sunshine you get crazy storms in Arizona to do denier hail the place where they get typhoons is that tight is it typhoons or monsoon monsoon yeah monsoons we just started seeing evidence like yesterday we got hail and like a little dabble of monsoon yesterday yeah like sometimes like people think of Arizona the thing of the desert right but there's a lot of different terrain in Arizona yes yes and you guys when it rains you guys get fucking pounded on right it's what is this Jim it's the hail test for the Tesla roof tiles so they did the test lifetime warranty on them boom oh it took it like a champ and what are those other two yeah the regular traditional roof tiles how their regular roof tiles so the Tesla panels are fucking better bench hundred mile an hour impact Wow Wow well then there you have it I'm in yeah cuz mmm that's what I've been waiting for to see if they can get this that technology up I'm just waiting for Elon Musk to run the world I'm like dude you're on point keep it up yeah just make roof tiles and cars and just keep it up yeah Ben you know I don't know that being completely off the grid is I think it's an option for some people there's just too many people for you to be actually you know completely unplug and be isolated yeah I don't want to be a pencil Tommy Owens don't know doesn't work it was a trade Tommy's turn into a big fuck fest right it's like the one do you'd be like the cult leader and you just want to bang there by his wife I don't know from experience that you're the ear aware of but now yes yes what happens right no see I think they're like off-the-grid like in terms of like non reliance but connectivity in terms of like being able to figure out what's going on the world yeah yeah that that's that's a that's a reasonable goal I think but I think even even being off the grid I feel like you can get to a certain point in today's society where you can be unplugged from your your power and your water but somebody's gonna come for your water so he's gonna come for there's various places around the United States where they come after you for growing your own food on your land do that really yeah there's weird stuff everywhere like that like what what kind of regulations are that do they have against it would end up using they would probably justify it in terms of your how your house is zoned residential in that oh not agriculture or you're you and you're not allowed to use the city water to water your garden I've actually heard this before I've heard people get in trouble with that before it's a it's just another level of government control do you think they're doing that it's just like taking the road you know you know you know prepper right yeah I'm a prepper but slightly but not and not in that Palace Jones sort of way no not that I'm not that banana's I think just being prepared and understanding that eventually there'd be an interruption and the water that comes to you and the food that gets to you just understanding how to grow food is not being a prepper no it's wise it's like having a lot of boxes checked off we just and it also doesn't it feel good like I'm sure I know that you love your wine I mean it's got to feel good when you have a glass of the wine that you've grown and created and works so hard on and it just established this perfect time of keeping in the barrels and you know I'm sure there's got to be like massive satisfaction to that yeah absolutely because I don't you know it spirals out into all these other other areas of understanding again how to how to grow your own food you start you start talking to and communicating with people that you wouldn't normally talk to like Republican guys now talking to the Liberal Democrat guy and then the and this religions talking to that religion and you know there's all these economic religious political lines that get blurred because in that moment talking about growing a thing and sustaining a local community a lot of those things tend to go away just turn this thing off right get back to understanding what it's going to take to make you know make these exchanges and do these activities you start to really feel connected with people rather than this weird divisive crap that goes on in the world today yeah I think there's definitely like we need to figure out how to spend more time just having regular normal day-to-day conversations because it seems to me like people are worse at it than they'd ever been before people interrupt people more than ever like they're not good at like listening and talking because I think people are so accustomed to communicating with people through devices it's almost like we're rusty we're rusty on how we talk to people because I don't do it that much yeah like how often you call someone on the phone not that off you and I have maybe never had a phone call maybe one phone conversation it's always text and kind of all my friends if someone calls me up it's like what's everything okay yeah like what's wrong yeah you know I don't use that thing for talking to somebody I don't use this I don't use this to talk to people because the technology to me still isn't where it should be because I'll be in the middle of making a point with somebody and the phone call will drop and wait to start over I'm sure you're mad because yes I just that's why I usually text your email because I can get the whole thought down and then and if we want to talk about summing up some details on it I'll say I'll call you from the landline so I'll actually call people from I'll find a landline all the way in line you know have you heard of those they don't even have them anymore the right right around illegal right around the same time as the cassette yeah I send a raven that's what I do I got some dope Ravens they're super smart you just got to leave like pineapple in the end that's what they like to go right to the pineapple take their of a little message what's up see this today oh Jesus Christ scientists make teleportation breakthrough yeah they are but that's in the New York Post they also did an article about how Travis Browne and Ronda Rousey are fading losers like it was the most ruthless article that is a great it's a great argument for not living in a condensed population and some of the articles in New York tabloid papers like they're so fucking mean yeah just something about like being in the like an island like Manhattan where but he stopped in there where people just get super shitty with each other and they find it okay to do so yeah so what is this teleportation it's saying that it's teleported a photon from earth to space like 50 miles into space that's not exactly what happened it transported the information of the proton which okay is also it's equally important because they can say to this set of facts Jim based somebody in space Wow alright Wow so in sending a photon is that like one step to sending like that's like the first step to say like it made a like I'm a carbon copy of it it's virtually identical it's like a identical twin of this so it could be that that you know those kind of newspapers are very similar to what we're seeing with Facebook as far as the immediate feedback and then they adjust the article and just that the the headline right to not only make money from clicks but also to manipulate what you're thinking about a particular subject so they can adjust your vote of you know purchasing patterns those kind of things so you know these clickbait things that could have been a word in that title that they know people like you love to see so they got you clicking on it even though there might be nothing in the article yeah you see a lot of that right yeah you see like purposely deceptive article headings hmm so they rope you in you're like what what are they doing but even doing that like they talk what happens the original photon the original photon remains present in the original location it's it's it's some first step in some quantum physics type of deal proving that it can actually happen first like just being a theory first I understood I listen to a one-minute video talk to my buddy about this do you know I are you buying fuck all that fuck all that anyone in the dome anywhere in a dorm one punch and your fucks on you and your proton one fucked in your fucking proton yeah I don't understand what they're saying so does that mean like one day they'll have a Jamie Vernon on a space holodeck in Arizona and they'll zoom you up to space but then you'll still he be here it's hard to say I don't think that that's what they're doing with it I think this means more like they can send them four packets of information without needing fibre or Wi-Fi or anything like that I think that's the first possible use of it I think it's a matter of time before we start duplicating things that we shouldn't be duplicating you know like in whole human beings like how many deranged monarchs are gonna get a hold of this like way before anybody else it's trillionaire dudes and they're gonna spend a shit ton of money to have copies of them and just make a bunch it's just what if it's just the Heath Ledger's that Joker was actually putting this out and he's figured out a way to get all of those billionaire people to jump on the spaceship that goes nowhere mmm and he's giggling somewhere see I always feel like we were always one invention that we don't see coming away from ruining everything yeah yeah I agree and it could be exact it could be exactly this kind of thing this this algorithmic view going down a rabbit hole in this narcissistic feedback on what you want to see and then it gels tells you what you want to hear and then it gets you to buy what you want to buy but like the thing you want to buy might be this rabbit hole of of leveling the playing field for everybody yeah it might be wants yeah I think the only yeah is there a way out of that doesn't seem okay well I think the only way out of it is is understanding that the things you're being told here this has nothing to do with mastership if that makes sense the phone just media things you're reading on your social media pages this has nothing to do with you yeah I read all those articles well that's not it's not necessarily mastership that's not you going to a master who has taught who's spent all this time doing a thing or researching a thing and you know master's degree in a thing and then you go to this class you take the time the effort it takes to get to that place and every step along the way is a new level of a revelation or some kind of epiphany of understanding of oh that's why we did this and then now I can understand that and educate yourself so destroying destroying an entire base of ignorance and knee-jerk reaction clicking on links and being fed horseshit it almost has to be like a conscious effort on each an individual just step back and go I hate that Trump supporter I hate that Hillary or Bernie supporter because of the things I've been told and the things I believe they've been fed back to me what if then this is the hardest step I think for most people what if I am completely wrong about all of it so how do I empty my vessel open my mind and try to figure out backtrack on what the truth is is this person really that much different than me are these people that much different did they grow up with a bad you know bad set of poison in their system did I grow up with a bad poison in my system I don't know so I don't know what there's any way out of it because the solution I'm talking about requires a lot of introspection self evaluation and a lot of being more open than most people are willing to be do you know why I think there's a way out of it because a lot of people like you saying that I know a lot of people that are saying that now and it seems like a message that's being broadcast by a bunch of people that have gone sort of through the gauntlet of life and had a bunch of trials and tribulations and they reach this point where they kind of have an understanding of what it's taken them to get there and a lot of people like you have this desire to relay this information and people are listening and there's a lot of other people that are saying the same thing that have also gone through their own separate trials right and I think it's a it's a more message than I've ever heard in my life and I'm almost 50 I'll be 50 next month and I feel like in my life I've no day August 11th really yep birthdays at 12 get the fuck out of your bed uh my my son's birthday is the fifth my why making buddies is the eighth Prince I went in and out of the army the first week of August we're basically on the same fraternity basically except for me I'm an Aries what's a girl's thing it's not a fraternity what does it call sorority yeah we're in the same sorority yeah I think more people are talking about though man I think yeah it's gonna be not gonna be for everybody but I think there's way more people that are trying to do better like with their life do better with their mind do better with themselves it says it's a very very common thing so much so there's a lot of criticisms about the various methods and people kind of losing sight and then it's like there's a bunch of bullshit artists that are capitalizing on this idea as well and they're not really doing it but they're pretending they're doing and they're talking about it but they're not really in action you can kind of see those guys always look a little doughy they always look you know they're not really doing it but they're talking about them yeah people not talking about shit they don't really do like some of my friends that uh they'll talk about writing comedy way more than they actually write comedy yeah like Judd Apatow said that he said they don't fucking talk about writing just right I think he's right yeah nice one it's like there's a fine line between inspiring discussing and then like sort of analyzing with people that you respect and trust and like and then actually doing the work yeah and and I think part of it is literally working I think getting your hands dirty and rasoi like fine day as a start I just think of it as therapy whatever money you're spending on a therapist take take that time and go find a community garden and just weed just go in there and plant some find some carrots do something to just kind of like unplug and touch dirt you know and do a thing and reconnect with that cycle if you can reconnect with that cycle of life in some level you start to really understand what what's more important you know some people some people have kids that helps some kind of reground themselves and redirect and focus their energies some people just find you know find gardening in that way but this is this is not this is that this is supposed to be a convenience this is just me trying to talk to you from a distance and very candid but as far as the information you're getting off of this thing in in firms of social media there's a lot of poison there's a lot of misdirect there's a lot of crap in there you have to kind of fight through it and literally go eat a garden yeah I think just I think you're definitely right I think doing that is good I also think doing difficult things is good I think that's one of the reasons why you're so drawn to jiu-jitsu and yes it's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life it's the hardest thing it's the most it's you know I'm getting no snowflake II weepy here but it's just it's it's it's not something that you are handed you have to do the work to get it and I had so many injuries over the years there's so much distance from this thing and I'm such a stubborn prick that I have I've started a thing I'm gonna finish this thing so that's kind of that's where I'm at with jujitsu and it's not it's not something that you can be handed well you know someone's legit when they get a fucking hip surgery and then they're back on the mat four months later that is first of all ridiculous and not advisable but admirable at the same time right it took me it took me a while to lose the I was gaining weight before the hip surgery because I just couldn't move as well as I wanted to obviously I mean it was completely destroyed hip no no cushion in there and then the recovery was and then I was on the row which is like one of the worst ways to recover from anything you're trying to recover from being there in the moment but the thing I did finally found my rhythm because I think last time we talked I talked about how it's hard to train on the road because I've got this thing I got to do with that night finding those guys finding the black belts that understand the low low impact you know slow roll putting threads together just doing simple positional drills all those things now I've been able to like you know I trained with a Dave and Dan Camarillo Henry Aikens hoed Rico kavagi comes down taught Fox comes down I've been able to train with a lot of people on the road that's amazing but you know we folk we find our we find our hour right before sound check and you know but it has to be people I trust that has to be people that have an understanding of I'm not here to do this I'm here to do right the same music yeah this is just something that helps you get to that yeah so I'm just chipping away at that purple belt trying to get to that next level yeah I feel like um in my opinion drills are like one of the most important things that people don't like to do is this it's just one of those things where it's jiu-jitsu like rolling and sparring it's so fun that people just want to get ready then we'll just roll light let's just roll light and so you just kind of do it but the real work is done in the drilling if you can't do it slow you can't do it fast especially if you don't understand it understand what it is you're supposed to be doing mm-hmm and if you have a good part a training partner a role player to help you and he's giving you the exact position that you're that you're trying to train if you got one of those pricks it's like you know Bluebell purple belt guy like no I'm just going to chit I'm gonna adjust this position no that's not that's not what you're here for right you know lights are important but yeah like dead drills are important to where a person just you just roll just roll through the the technique with them right yeah I mean it's think I've always found it really interesting how many people like find it sort of in in their life and it becomes like almost like a replacement for religion in a lot of ways becomes like this grounding thing for them yeah I can see that yeah I mean it's just it seems like the real difficult things whether it's jujitsu or whatever you're in do you know I have a buddy that's into ultra marathons that's his thing like it's just like pushing his body to run these crazy distances becomes like this weird sort of like centering thread in his life because he knows it's so fucking difficult that all the other things get easier okay you know yeah that's he can run that's that's good for him I'll let him do that well you said that some people can run with a hip replacement yeah I've heard that there's some guys that they'll go in every couple years and have the the actual pad if it's like a silicone pad or something that they're just they just cut him open like a small incision pop it out pop their hip out I guess so I guess during the surgery they go in from the front Mike I went from their front so like you know my leg was laying across my head while they're in there digging Mike you know so it's a full-on scooping out the hip sawing cutting off sawing off the the hip bone the leg the femur bone putting a spike down the middle of your femur with the ball on top and then putting it back in and then waking you up about an hour later going let's go for a walk oh my god how many how many inches is the spike the spike that goes into the bone I think it's like it's like about 20 Irish inches the size of my dick sorry why do we talk about the dick oh my God look how far it goes in oh yeah Jesus Christ it's huge thank you oh look at that oh my god that's freaking me out how does that not just like the mechanical leverage seems like it would just snap your femur yeah well my leg kicked you you think you taking that okay I would I would please don't please think of something like a TV right at the bottom of that spike that's a wrap son yeah I feel like right where that spike connects to the meat I feel like someone who's got a real good leg kick which is going right through that yeah that's why but I think the bone density what happens with the bone density is that's why the healing process is so slow because the bone is actually healing around that thing right that's maybe in theory more dense than the actual spike whoa but you're right just the physics of hitting kicking that you would think would that's there that's your weak spot what about like falling and stuff do they they advise you the one thing they don't have you do is if you were to bend my leg back my knee back that way like a lunge mm back don't do this um kind of thing it will pop out forward oh Jesus Christ now I'm even with no weight no it would have to be some kind of weight I push forward whatever it used to be the way if I put my knees up on my chest to do like butterfly mm-hmm the way that they designed the hip before it would actually pop out that way so far but now they've fixed it where it's like it has to be this other extreme angle to get it to pop out but it can pop out has popped out on you yet no it has not do you do any weight lifting to strengthen everything around it yeah was a lot of a lot of walking you know some some weight training I really like the kettlebells yeah doing this stuff I think just that just that wrestling you know working with somebody not actually doing the takedowns for warmup I do take downs but you know just that act of of lateral front back mm-hmm and then having somebody pour you those different ways in a low stance yeah low stance I like that low center of gravity drop that's good for the legs for sure so kettlebells that the the battle ropes do bad body weight squats I dunno I'm a big fan of bodyweight squats you Hindu squats they call them it's a type of squat that you do where you do like a lot of reps I'll do 200 reps okay and what you do it's hard to do it's not it seems like it's easy because you do the first 10 you like I could do 200 and then you get to 20 you like woo and then you get to 50 so there's no weight just you doing your thing just me and we go you go get down yeah you go down you touch you drop your hands back you touch your hands to the ground and then as you go up you bring your hands up forward like I'll try that it looks like this hang on Hank all the Hindu squat hey gotta get controversial so you stand you stand like this and you you stand with your back straight up and your hands are like behind your butt and you go down like this 1 2 3 and as I'm going down my heels go up so at the on the bottom like at the bottom I'm actually on the ball of my feet my heels are up and my hands go behind my heels right and then as I come up I touch the ground and I go up to this position okay and I breathe out as I do this I'm going 200 200 of these bitches I just you've done like five and I'm ready to take him out go inside let's just keep going let's have a doughnut could we just have doughnuts no man I'm I think a lot of people that they don't do enough shit with their legs is that what you do is that the more shit you do with your legs whether it's running or squatting or deadlifting it's just your whole body feels better and people neglect that shit yeah I do more of like stuff like that than I do arm stuff I think my next step is I talked about before is like you know I had broken my wrists I think the last time I was in here I'd like that actually was a broken wrist not a sprained wrist oh yeah so I she broke both my wrists that year and I had shoulder issues rotator shit issues so I'm just do anything to that I did those mom cells not the PRP not the PRP the other one that Regina keen yeah I think did that one would you do it in Arizona they were they were doing show really they're not cheap no no it's not cheap they take your own blood and do it no and that's not Regina Kane must be something different okay so it's like you know it's something like that and then I started researching going whoa you know we just discovered Hep C a couple years ago maybe I shouldn't be putting some kind of weird foreign shit and they just discovered Hep C well you're just hepatitis in general like it's you know it's like on the rise well 20 years ago people didn't know what the hell that was you know 30 years ago they just thought people were skanks they didn't know skanks have actual like terrible diseases yeah male and females just I'm just thinking and just in general like you know things that we here take some Prozac and then no don't take any Prozac right you know just changing their minds about every thing that they put in you or pull out of you that's for sure that's for sure true so you know I just I stopped I want to do more what you were doing with actually spinning out your own stem cell yeah there's a couple different procedures that they're doing now one of them that's really important is they're shooting stem cells directly into disk tissue so people that have bulging discs am i they're able to heal the disks and actually create more disk tissue and this is all just super cutting-edge stuff well they're the stem cell technology is some of the most intriguing and fascinating things they're going on right now on modern medicine just they're they're able to do a means work means just they think that within a few years they're gonna be able to fix things here's one thing they're doing this is really important for people I better not forget this when they used to blow out things like ACLs they used to have to replace it these to either replace it with a cadaver ligament or they would replace it with your Peet patellar tendon they would cut a piece of that like I had that done or they would take your hamstring sometimes they take a chunk of your hamstring they screw in place now they have a new method real new where they can actually they've figured out a way to repair the actual ACL itself they figured out how to tie it back together again and it heals it heals way quicker you're walking almost instantly like after the surgery and you're back to action in three months it's a totally different ballgame they had this guy who competed in the Olympics five months after getting the surgery on his achilles he blew out his Achilles and he used to be like instantaneously your leg was useless and it was useless for like a year now this guy's five months later is competing in the Olympics and they're shooting stem cells in there to help the healing it's fucking crazy what's going on right now that's nuts we live in an awesome time yeah I mean for a guy like Hickson who has all those back problems man this is let's get him on that I know right yeah I think Hickson is all like holistic though you know he wants to just do yoga and ride off into the sunset on somebody's like a pale horse or some Sh yeah yeah yeah like meditating on something where they light it on fire and that's how he's gonna go out you know I mean I just I don't know how much he's into getting a bunch of stuff shot into him no I mean I think I I admire that in a lot of ways he's a fascinating character and he's the guy in my opinion that opened up a lot of people's eyes to yoga from that chowk documentary yeah yeah people saw that and they were like oh wait a minute yeah the baddest motherfucker on earth does yoga does yoga yeah and when you see what he can do with his body like oh well of course how are you gonna hold on to that guy look good look at how he can move yeah could stand up on a balance beam and do a full split holding his foot over his head and he's 40 you know at the time he was no now he's in his 50s he's amazing quite a quite a fascinating guy but not interested and getting shot up with stem cells I am sign me up I don't I don't have a problem with my ACL I just want to do it let's just do it does just do it shoot it in there shooters ever like that what happens yeah some people go down to Mexico and they get it shot into their veins that Dan Bilzerian guy you know that guy is the Internet he's he's hilarious I've had him on the podcast before he's a poker player and he is famous from being this like Internet guy with a ton of money that flies around in jets and has all these hot chicks with him he's always like shooting guns and driving dune buggies and shit he goes down to Mexico all the time it gets it shot in his veins intravenously and I'm like what does it do for he's like I don't know I feel fucking great no like good is bad no one exactly knows right but they take stem cells and they just got electrolytes they launch and you intervene bas Rutten said he did it he felt like he had power coming you guys it was like I had light coming out of my hands like like the first time you did meth okay no I think it's better than that okay it's better than that like meth and ecstasy together all right it's like like you're energetic but you're also loving I think there's something to what we're doing right now we're I think within the next 20 or 30 years we're gonna have a real real problem with people not dying I'm grandpa now with the current administer would be all right with that motherfucker he's so egomaniacal don't you think you'll be shooting stem cells into himself and try to keep himself alive forever yeah buddy's gonna send buddy else off to go fight for the materials that go into those shots magic Trump found out about it before anybody you started reverse aging like Benjamin buttons amazing just all the sudden Trump is like younger again kind of freaking everybody out we know he's 90 but he looks great yeah as long as he goes all the way down here we can put them over your knee and like a baby give him a timeout what do you think he's gonna happen with this dude I think it's a smoke screen I think there's so many other things going on that that we're not paying attention to but it is a testament to just just the level of frustrations I think that people have had just with with government in general and the internet and the social media has been able to polarize us all enough to where we don't talk to each other to really sort sort out some of the you know the actual issues that are going on so you have this yeah this spectacle going on right now that it's amazing it is a spectacle but I always wonder whether or not it's at Orkut orchestrated spectacle or whether we just try to find patterns when patterns don't even exist and what it really is is just this is just a goofy dude who loves attention and we have a fucking popularity contest to see who runs the country and you and you I get like I said go back just back it up to see where people really frustrated with the Obama administration where they frustrated with the Bush administration with it you know where is it is it connected are they just looking for something different because if you look historically at places that have had some success as a country and then they have some problems we start seeing some issues and they're just whatever the incumbent person is the the party the the group all they want is something else something different we want to get rid of that but something different in and historically when that happens shit just goes sideways there just because they just wanted anything else and they got exactly what they got something worse yeah yeah that's the problem is worrying about it the same way you worried about technology like one guy can one day create one thing and it fucking ruins everything and you almost feel like that with like a president like we can ask for something different and then one day we get it and it fucking ruins everything like that what I worry about most is a lot of what he's doing like with this battle against the intelligence agencies all the shit he talks about them it's like if they start hiding stuff from him because there were that he's gonna tell stuff to Russian guys in you know and talk about certain things like like he revealed top-secret information about Isis want to use laptops as bombs they told the Russians that like now if they can't trust him and if they develop this thing where it's them versus him you got a you got a real serious problem on the on your hands there because that's gonna that attitudes gonna carry on to the next administration yeah whether it's pence or some Democrat or whoever the fuck comes in after him right fuck man it's all scary it's just people didn't know what they were voting for they didn't understand they thought they thought it was gonna be we're gonna drain the swamp yeah like this is motherfucker just he just backed up the biggest sewer truck ever to the swamp and he's he's pumping shit in there like crazy yeah well you know I agree but I think the the only they're all in it and again y'all all we can do I think is to step back and fight fight the battle so here's know if you can think of the battlefield as being your your old school you know there's a the goals over there capture the flag kind of battlefield your first battle is is ignorance your first enemy is ignorance trying to figure out how to get past the misinformation the deed you know all that stuff just to get past ignorant 8 yourself first of all you don't think it's flat I think we need to see a rock from the sky slam into the earth I think that's what we need we need like a small European city wiped out just so we go oh okay well this is this is crazy what do we were concentrating on bullshit I'm gonna goddamn shooting-gallery Arjun life is just so short we don't understand the real spans of time right we don't understand that periodically this fucking whole thing is gonna get rattled yes extremely no doubt about it it's coming yeah I think that's you know it's Idol you know idle hands are the devil's playground you've heard that cliche know that really is you know so my prepper that prepper side of me is that person you know what if we don't have what if we don't have electricity for a week because or whatever misty you only find for whatever reason wine yeah just you know just but just be haven't understanding what that is so that one it's just a starter a precursor or just a a dry run of what what happens when that rock does fall from the sky because it happens all the time you know just you know historically historically if happens a lot and I do believe that that is there that would be the that would be the reset button I prefer not to have that be the reset but I prefer that our consciousness caught up with itself and we just kind of start talking to each other I would like that too but I think we need something yeah a little shake them up maybe it doesn't even have to hit a city like how about hit the ocean and we catch it on video just boom mile high waves wipes out all of Carbon beach Malibu come on son all those billion dollar they call it the billionaire Beach he's fine assholes they said would only work it would only work if it was a global event right because if it's isolated because we've had tsunamis so large we don't care large cities yeah nobody nobody does anything about it it would have to be we had Katrina that but that's down there with those people it needs to be something that's nationwide that hits all of us at the same time where we stop with this bullshit stop with this polarized bullshit start talking to each other this is what happens Connor connects with a left hand employing methods we made with his chin Floyd Goes Down and at the count of eight when he's about to get up the whole arena gets hit with a meteor boom Las Vegas has wiped off the face of the planet everybody's dead but we saw the feed up until the asteroid impact is just one big bright spark of light but everybody starts tune in to CNN there's a huge crater where Vegas used to be and the asteroid though it has an EMP that hits every single feed that goes to every single camera in TV and it wipes out every electronic device that's been watching the whole thing I'm not you getting too crazy that's that's so that wait a minute that's we just need the wipeout me help me out here we don't even need to wipe out Vegas I love Diggs don't get me wrong yeah I just feel like we need something where people are you have to it has to thank them it has to affect them on some level that actually kick-starts their compassion Jean yes you're sure you want to balance between your survival Jean and your compassion Jean because you know you got to figure back a long time ago the thing that that that helped us be here today is we weren't we weren't stronger we weren't faster than we are we weren't larger than the things that we're eating us we had to be smarter we had to be clever we had to come up with ways to create something from nothing to be able to defend ourselves against predators or worrying so that creative that creative juice that was there and we were trying to we were establishing food shelter and clothing as well as keeping protected from predators and it was that creative side of us that artistic side of us that actually was you know - that's what you have to think that that creative side of us to keep us ahead of these creatures the elements all these things and as time has gone on when you no longer are threatened by these things there's no you know there's plenty of clothes everywhere pretty much plenty of food everywhere where we live a lot of idle hands a lot of idle hands and so we've lost touch with that imminent threat so we have we started to turn on each other yeah almost girls with fake asses people get mad I'm mad that Iggy Azalea what's her name I was shooting all these people angry at her because they were ass is fat angry just angry at her fake-ass well they don't even have a McRib here at the McDonald's Arizona keep a McRib I had 12 seasons I know but just that's that's you know no disrespect to the people that get caught up in that broken nail syndrome but like that is what it is that's your its tragedies are not tragedies right so we need some kind of life-threatening something that's really global and it's it crosses religious economic social racial it has to cross all those lines that we're people are like what the fuck yeah it has to expose microaggressions for the preposterous notion that there really are like if you get hit in the head with a meteor and someone gets mad at a microaggression just there are two very different things you see that meteor almost hit him her okay you see the meteor almost hit her yeah cisgender piece of shit living with all those Cowboys in Arizona yeah whatever bro I'm a big fan of Arizona my favorite people of there use any one of my bathrooms feel free oh thank you that's sweet do you have a restaurant there too yeah we just opened an Osteria so fuck do you have time for all this I don't do it myself okay that's the planet I get it all going and I hand it off to awesome people that's a good move so Jesse and curator or running that thing Briana it's a Osteria so what is in Austria basically a wine bar with with food so it's a you know a gathering place where you like that place I'm going to in Studio City yes what's that place called Augustine wine bar god damn that was good yeah the food was amazing too yes awesome Matthew caner wonderful place they brought out some like 1921 oh yeah we did some we we just I was you he raped me I did not financially yes financially and it wasn't my idea I didn't ask you to spend that much money I don't know what kind of wine that was yeah but it was fascinating wine there was like ooh this is wine yeah I kind of got it for a brief moment yeah and then I wandered off under some tangent I think I actually said I think I was like hey set up a fight with me and Bourdain no you wanted to fight somebody or day was it Bourdain yeah Anthony Bourdain might kiss like that's pretty drunk he's crazy yeah Anthony's got the crazy gene for sure he's got that I used to be a former heroin addict and I almost died Jean yeah you know it only gets activated and people that have like been to the brink of death yeah I met a bunch of people like that though I think it's a real thing mm-hmm I think there's something that happened there's some scary people like Matt Brown the guy who fights in the UFC the same kind of gene he's got that I used to die I died I came back gene yeah I met him he's really nice guy it's a nice guy but please there's that edge of like I think maybe they've been to the dark land when people have been to the dark man's they come back different it's like Stephen King's pet cemetery you know you bury the cat comes back to life and it's like okay bring the cat back to fuck don't fuck that cat there is something that happens to people when they've been to the dark lands yeah yeah so they Austria it's Arizona grows its own wheat so all of our pastas and breads are from Arizona wheat okay let me ask you this is that is can you please not do that we're talking Jimmy Jimmy fell this is a new Jimi Hendrix poster that we have if you notice in the background folks the old one was not really his mugshot the new one is actually his mugshot so we had it swapped out this is the real Jimi Hendrix mugshot laughter why they're not is it true about wheat that there are strains that are wild or rather unmodified that are much more easy for the body to digest yes so Hayden Mills is one of the many down in Phoenix that are actually milling the local week so they're looking they're basically cultivating around southern Arizona heirloom wheat and that's the idea okay they're going back to the problem with it of course it's always going to give the give and take is that those heirloom pure heirloom wheats they have far less complex glutens and them and there's far they don't produce as much wheat so just your production on an acre of land is significantly lower for this stuff but it's tastier it has more nutrients and then from there the next step of course is people understanding time so you're you're taking that we you're milling it and then when you go to make your bread any kind of fermentation in that that you're getting your your inoculating that to make your bread that Siddhant letting this dough sit overnight you're letting it rise for a longer period of time because that whole process is breaking down those glutens okay so my sourdough bread you want every sokka's mostly commercial commercial bread the fermentation you know the rising that dough is is is almost instantaneous and it was right in the oven and then people are not chewing their food they're just cramming it in and it's probably coming from places that are doing a lot of pesticides and all the extra stuff that's going on those those crops so the heirloom we movement ends up tying hand and hand in hand with with understanding the slow food movement where I take it take your minute chew your food understand where your food comes from try to get it you know organic and local then I go that goes all the way back to the wheat so yes so there so they ask you a question yeah there is what happened is they over World War one to trying to make sure that people are going to be fed during those wars they were manipulating the wheat so that it was much higher production wheat but now the flavors gone the nutrition is not there at being resistant to all these things that all the glutens are very complex and then so when you're actually baking making the bread out of these things or making pastas out of them it's just there's all this extra crap you know get created a Frankenstein's monster with this wheat mmm so your body of course is reacting to all those things that have nothing to do with actually having better having wheat it's a very controversial subject a lot of people try to claim that there's no difference between the wheat of today in the wheat of the past and they also try to claim that the only people that have issues with gluten are people that have gluten sensitivity celiacs disease things along those lines and my my gripe with that is that I always feel that the people that say that they don't have a good sense of their body I don't think they're real athletes because I think when you talk to a real I'm not saying you can't perform like a real world-class athlete by eating pasta you definitely can what I think is we want to talk about total optimization you want to talk about your body like running as smoothly as possible for me at least I notice a difference between eating a lot of bread and gluten which I used to do a lot and not doing it when I don't do it I just feel better I have more energy I feel like my body struggle less to digest the food and I don't have the big crash after the food is over he doesn't mean that I can't perform on it right like I don't have a gluten sensitivity issue like I can eat it it's not if that's not the problem if someone said well you're fine you eat it it's no big deal it's not that it's no big deal I don't think it's the optimal thing to do I just think that it's delicious I don't think it's killing me but I don't think if you want to like give your body the very best fuel pasta like regular pasta isn't that fuel but I wonder if you can get some of that heirloom pasta if you would notice a difference I wonder if you would feel the difference in trying the two ok so similar conversation parallel you're in you're in Italy you're having bottles of wine you're having dinner it tastes great you had a good thing you woke up next day you didn't have a hangover all those things over here I have wine and I get hangovers and I get sick and I do those things and it's like so it must be that the Italian wine is better or has less sulfites or something like right well most likely what it was is over here you're a fat pig and you sat in your house and you drank a bottle of wine with your buddies without taking a walk in a foreign country because you're walking to your restaurant there right you're having food and you're eating over the course of three hours with your friends and you're eating food with your wine you're eating less of it most likely it has a lower alcohol content because it's meant to go with food rather than being this Mountain Dew with alcohol in it that you get out of California right you know it's it's the California one so we not I did not I did an awful California Arizona thing we're going on maybe and make you're fucked you're all fucked okay good Irish wine no so I think there's an experiential thing that's happening with those conversations and it's the same thing with the pasta pasta makes me feel sluggish you ate 17 pounds of it right don't eat 17 pounds of it but yes going back to having just the initiation of like understanding the conversation of heirloom wheat and understanding that there's a different arguing that there's a difference even if there is a now you're looking at it maybe you're having less of it right maybe your maybe your portioning out better and you're paying attention to your diet more hey that's a step in the right direction absolutely yeah I read something about the French how the French are always eating bread but they do have that older wheat bread and they eat a lot of fats with their bread like it's constantly with butter and oil and they cook with a lot of butter and oil and that those carbs in that oil together apparently it's just a better fit for your digestive system I could see that I kind of did that I didn't stick to it letter of the law but I did a little bit of ketogenic yeah right for a minute where I cut out sugars carbs all those things just feel I felt a lot better right away now now I go back and I'll have some pasta once or twice a month in small portions I'll have some bread but I don't eat a lot of it I enjoy it better now yeah or it's not just a treat it's a treat it's enough you know that at that point like you know proteins and vegetables are the staple and I have I have treats now yeah I feel the exact same way I feel like I have my nutrition which is like I try to eat really healthy food 80% of the time and then 20% of the time I like to go to a restaurant and get linguine with clams you know it's just it's just a experience it's a delicious experience I know it's not the best thing for me but it's a treat yeah you're you you know this is you get one life so let's enjoy it also especially like what you're doing like haven't when you have a restaurant I mean you're selling an experience right yeah it's just delicious wines and delicious foods and the two of them together with conversation that's all that you know you're like oh try this try this you know when people are doing that it's like this whole sensory experience is all combined together it's not just about nutrition right it's about the art of creating this sensory experience because one could argue that your your well-being is is your you're actually increasing your life experience here and your in your quality of life by having this experience with these people with these wines that you'll actually feel better tomorrow next week because of that interaction because of that show even though like that's straight butter and that's straight you know yeah and wine but no I think you're 100% right I think that's that sort of an overlooked aspect of health is that you like positive experiences and and and just also like when you go to a really good restaurant and especially if you get to meet that cook yeah like you meet someone to cook something for you could say thank you and you have this high cool feedback with the person who made your food it's like there's something going on there it's like this exchange it's and it's it's like a sand castle in the way it's beautiful it's amazing and how them fucking the skill involved in creating it but then it's gonna go away you know it's gone it's it was a temporary experience and in this world of you know the NSA stockpiling text messages and dick pics in some fucking warehouse in Utah you don't we get some loss for that it is it is they're gonna address I don't know the I know that I wouldn't give it out they'd come get me come get you and tell you now we're doubling down on your dick pics they they got a fucking warehouse gigantic like Costco filled with well my would ever be a slightly bigger warehouse yeah I think um I mean in the concerts - right like live concerts are kind of that way - right like that's a temporary experience I mean there's one thing to listen to a song that you have on your phone let's do it over and over again but you're gonna see a live concert you're experiencing the guy like on stage sing that song you're experiencing the sound coming out of the guitar right when the guys touching the chords that's why this that's why this stuff annoys me the the phones at the shows because right I'm a firm believer in oral tradition I feel like I'm not for a believer I just I embrace the storytelling I embrace that whole tradition of oral tradition and being able to describe to your friends that sitting around that you know fire after a good long day of hunting will you tell the story of the hunt and do you do all those things and those and those family stories and other you know your grandfather's your great grandfather stories are told in that setting and you have to remember that you're not writing it down it's a it's a it's a tradition of understanding the details being able to explain and expand on the details from your recollection of what you saw but if you have no skills of absorbing what you saw if you rely on this thing to capture their stories for you first of all nothing you're gonna get at a show was gonna be represented represent what you just saw or what you were there for and I guess you know as a postcard I suppose it works but like it's not you know stay present stay with these people to be there for this thing that's far more important and you know also as courtesy cuz maybe the person behind you would like to be that person who's writing this all letter now your shits in their way people hold up fucking iPads there's 12-inch iPads I saw some dude at the Laugh Factory that day at a fucking iPad the people behind you have to like yeah it's crazy everybody's got their phone out so that you know you're first that first barrier we talked about the ignorance just getting past understanding how to just get past not just what you think you know you know all those things erasing erasing everything think you know get past the ignorant your own ignorance first of all right but just then that situational awareness this kind of goes in hand-in-hand with that who are you not only in your world but who are you in other people's world when I'm driving my my primary mission is to get out of your way I want to get out of the way I want to get room going I'm gonna get out of the way I don't want to have you get out of my way because I'm going to a place I'm paying attention to where you are as I'm driving because if I think like that if I think I'm in your way this is all gonna work out better mmm we're all gonna we're all gonna get along if you think like that on the road like I am in your way let me figure out how I can make sure that I'm I'm getting where I'm going I'm not gonna put myself I'm not just gonna pull over the side of the road while you all drive by I'm I'm gonna get out of the way so that I make it convenient for you to get where you're going as well we're all going someplace right we're in a car around right let's not let's not fight here yeah let's not film ourselves driving either right I saw someone FaceTime and while they're driving in today holding up the phone talking this I'm passing by I saw a dude doing candy crush a while back playing candy crush on his phone while he's driving it's like whoa people film fireworks does anybody ever watch it that makes no sense to me yeah you send it dude you wouldn't believe the fireworks I'm gonna send it to you too please send it I can't wait to see it video do you mind if I regram your fireworks I'd rather you not I'd really like all the hits awful video that's out of focus you can tell what the fuck it is just see some lights flashing off but when you go to a fireworks display you see 50 fucking people holding up their goddamn phones yeah what are you doing leave you goddamn life live your fucking life right speaking of live your life when you see yourself smiland up man I'm always wound up I got a problem down Iran today Conor fucking settle down settle down I ought to put you down well you have so many different projects how do you choose like what to it like when you take on something like a restaurant or you know opening this jujitsu school or any of the number numerous projects that you do you already are so fuckin busy you have a family you already have these businesses and bands how do you decide like what to do you just go on your instinct like what to do well you know everything has its own individual needs so and the and when it comes of bands or touring or writing there are absolute needs and processes lead times right if you're gonna put out a book you have to you have to understand that there's a hello he said is he wrote a book dudes fuck he plugged that makes me feel lazy he's one of the few people I know that makes me actually I read it when Sarah I didn't you know I was I was involved you can credit goes their attention with Maynard James Keenan yes a perfect union of contrary things boom with my American yeah so I it's it's it's understanding organizing your time delegating is huge delegating is huge standing what it's going to take what kind of effort it's gonna take for those things when it comes to winemaking I'm locked down for that period of time when it comes to writing for example with 2ol or with perfect circle or Puscifer understanding you know timing when we can get into that in a minute wait wait no okay yeah so it's it really does come down to understanding I'm really good at planning you know planning ahead and looking at things so if I think if somebody comes along as it's here we're gonna do we're thinking about doing a film you want to be in the film my goal when is it because I already have my year you should see my schedule it's it's a year and a half out I'm really you're just locked in yeah because there's you know there's things that I know that if for example if you're gonna put out vinyl as a band generally speaking unless you're somebody who can make some calls and cut some corners if you're gonna deliver a master to actually cut vinyl and nowadays you want your vinyl it'll come out on the day that your record comes out you don't want it to be a delayed thing and have it all be scattered it takes you know three months that that's your that's your lead time for production no less than no less than three months you have like and you have to make an order like say like XML thousands that you have so you have to plan ahead so if you if the if you finally get all your shit together and you've got your you got your masters you're gonna do a thing then you have to go okay well then once that's once that's there the release date can't be any sooner than this date what that date is January first that's not good nobody releases a record on January first Wisie just gets the bad time to release a record you just came out of Christmas it's like it's it's like business-wise they just don't you just don't do that having a rock concert on a New Year's Eve that's a different thing right people are out partying they're gonna do their thing no it's so you're gonna release a record in the spring you're gonna release a record in the fall that's when you really is it generally speaking people really saw summer as well but optimum times are optimum times so just knowing that will give all up it takes that long to produce the record and get you know set up press and do interviews you know is for lead times in a magazine or online you know interviews are scheduled out we had this planned months ago a couple months ago yes I couldn't just you couldn't you would just call me last week you can go hey you're gonna come in now right we don't know what our schedules are so you're thinking ahead right so same thing with with the music you're always you're always kind of looking ahead to go well in order to deliver that master that means we had to be mastering that piece by here and we had to be mixing and you know mixing and then looking at the mixes again and fixing anything it's meant to retract something any kind of you know scrambling last minute before mixing that's gonna take this amount of time well in order to mix we have to track right so you have to have everything written before you can actually track it to mix it generally speaking so that means all the songs have to be written by this day if you're gonna record all of them and mix all of them and master all of them and release them all on the same day right Wow so you have to think all the way back to that day like where are we today are those songs finished today cool then we can start recording them tomorrow for next week no how do you know when a song is finished like do you if you give yourself a deadline like say if you say you know we have six months to complete this album or whatever it would be and you have a song that like man it's just something about the songs this doesn't feel right it's not done just something feels off like how do you how do you finish something by a deadline sometimes you don't so you just take it out of the album on your side for later or how do you how do you do that yeah of course that varies with everybody if it's not ready it's not ready so you keep delaying and try to get it right I guess are you second-guess it or you start realizing these are just songs but you only just finish them hmm you know remember that feeling when you were kid will you get an album and some of the songs were just fucking amazing and then you would hear like one or two what fuck is this piece of shit right how did this get on Rolling Stones album well most likely it's because they had a deadline and their record company made them they didn't you know they were locked into a contract and said that they had to deliver by a certain time right but if you're not de locked into that kind of a contract then you can kind of take forever which is an equally awful thing are you free of contracts now are you your own man comes to mutual has one more record into a contract perfect circle just signed up for a a 1 a 1 album deal through through a company to do a you know it's one off album mm-hmm Puscifer is an independent project we've been independent from the beginning so do you prefer that or is there benefits to both I think that I think there's benefits to all those things depends on if you know it depends on how many how much how many trust issues you have I guess like you're going to work with a large company if you can trust them to handle and carry some of the water on some of these things without it getting lost or spilled or you know dumped yeah you can work with a company like that it depends on your goals are suppose is it like more of a benefit now that your I mean especially I don't know if now you're dealing with the resurgence of vinyl it's been pretty steady over the last few years right it's kind of like a yeah like a mason jar type thing people weren't uh old funky stuff you know yeah I think there's there's still that nostalgic a feel of touching the vinyl and being able to have have that thing and listen to a day there is a difference but I feel like going back to what you had mentioned earlier about people realizing yeah we I think we need to start looking and talking to each other again and reconnecting and I feel like vinyl is another tip of that iceberg of that right connection of like it's not long it's that this is so temporary and so yeah digital yeah so ditch so one EMP away from all that stuff being gone your entire all those experiences you wasted he were you were recording the fireworks rather than actually looking at the fireworks and then you've lost your chopped your phone in the toilet God's gone or an EMP wipes out all of the servers that are on your cloud and so all those photos you thought were safe somewhere no longer so you freak me out man yeah all right yeah so I think vinyl there's that there's a connection there's a tactile does it sound better I think it does yeah I think it does because the pen son are you are you Creed it's never gonna sound better how dare you what is that Nickelback it's shit on all the ways you could shit on with a free punch hurry up dude I was a good one NSYNC was always a good one dude oh wow you went deep deep Backstreet Boys remember you should you build punch punch down on them it was the easy shot I had the menudo album did you know somebody takes more punches than Nickelback yeah they take a lot of shots yeah people just go after them yeah and they're like they never fight back like what the fuck man well because they I know on some level they asked for it sorry had they asked for it I don't know I'm just I'm just jumping in on this Rat Pack they make good stripper music yes they do you know they make good pole music yeah I have girl spin around on a pole all right it's Nickelback yes I think yeah I think that is the that's the vinyl connection I think is there's a lot of guys nowadays like of tool for example would just they like analog name they like tracking to tape and to really translate those things vinyl is your perfect medium for that thing it's just not very convenient there's no record stores there's like right when I released the first Puscifer record in 2007 from the time we started recording that record till the time we released it there was one number of stores when we started recording and there was one fifth the number of stores actually in existence by the time we actually released it the record industry stopped and went away during that period of time so 2007 was when the wave rolled back like you could see it was gone and it was gone and that was still with Best Buy's that were still selling CDs was still part of that 120th Wow no this is all it's all rolled back to where the small independent stores that weren't greedy that really had a relationship with their customers that enjoyed vinyl that had all those things those are the ones that have survived and thrived like amoeba yeah yeah those kind of but much smaller versions of those things like Ziya records and Arizona yeah I've seen a few of those on the road and I've gone into a bunch of them and they're kind of cool that's it's a totally different thing it's almost like you're going to an antique store wheezes grave if you ever go through Stinkweeds oh yeah in Arizona oh I think that'd be cameras gonna kill me Tempe because I couldn't remember it is I just do the Tempe improv all the time that's a cool little spot yeah tempies interesting little town yeah yeah the whole area is really awesome so when you when you make a run of those things you kind of have to decide like as they're selling when to make more of them - right yeah well as as a small project I post refer your you know we're right in the checks so you don't wanna over you don't want to over produce these things because then you're kind of sitting on them and for us at the level that we're operating you always want to operate in that level where it's sustainable right that's kind of a beat word but yeah I you know I use it all the time because I this it's the most accurate word to really look yes sustainable if I can keep this thing to keep this thing alive I don't want to keep going back to other pockets of money to make this thing I just think should stand on its own she had to be making all these decisions as if this is an independent business on its own ready to survive and so yeah you have to pay attention to if they want you know if they want ten make nine mm yeah through 110 make nine give you the people wanting more always always don't know don't live past your means all right stay up there stay yeah that good Goldilocks zone yes do you anticipate ever trimming it down to one band or do you like work when three different projects I think just a nature of of tool in general I'll jump into them obvious 1d is just their their process and their writing process is is so drawn-out and I mean I'm sure there's a lot of reasons that go into why the delay has been so long but when you have a project like that there's always going to be time for me to do other things and I will I will definitely I just like doing it right I like doing it more I like to release records and write things a little more quickly than those guys like to write so their process is very analytical and I think you know at some point maybe because so much time is going by with from the last album there has to be some little bit of fear in there you know you've got like has or it's this record gonna be as good as the last one you know the anticipation now is now the pressure is huge so I'm sure there's some of that goes into play but as far as the way that Danny and Adam and Justin right it's a very very tedious long process and they're always going back over things and questioning what they did and stepping back and going back farther and going forward and in a way it's like they're they're laying a foundation they're putting in the footings for a house so I can't write I can't write melodies until the footings are in place I can't write words until the melody is in place I can't like I can't build walls and then start decorating this place until the foundation is in place because if they keep changing the foundation changing the footings the melodies change and then the story of course isn't getting written so that's where we are I mean there's a lot of there's a lot of footings that keep shifting lots of awesome footings but they keep changing so and they keep changing their minds so I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing it's just their process is this a challenge for you to kind of manage your own personal expectations with the work of others and like because I know you're so you're very prolific and you're a guy that just like you're very disciplined so you're always grinding and then when you manage those expectations and you're dealing with a bunch of other artists and you're all come you know commercial together converging together on this yeah I just make a word up I think I just made it up yeah so you know when you have a lot of very strong-willed stubborn opinionated people that have had success myself included like yeah when you give somebody some success they're pretty they're pretty convinced they're right yeah you know so so it's hard to it's hard to talk to me it's hard to talk to them it's hard to talk to people that are in that position because they've been successful and so you think that the reason you got there is because of whatever position it is you're taking today right which is fine but our you know our process has has evolved over the years and that you know that stubborn nature you try yet again take a step back and not take any any of these things personally you know that's our tendency it's like what is you right you know you get that way and familiarity breeds contempt kind of thing how much is the problem is expectations of the fans because it fans like one new shit come on where's the fucking new shit and that's and that's you know that I'm sure that that was around 15 20 years ago but without social media and without that direct access of bitching yeah you know like the star reviews on like the on iTunes when people are like writing reviews of shows music or movies or whatever it's like again go to a master learn from the master to the point where you are no you have mastership although that's gone he's just like it hook you suck it took forever to load I don't like the guy with that hair fuck this one one star like right okay but like being able to do that yeah they love it especially if you work at like Jiffy Lube you're sitting there on your fucking break and you're smoking cigarette and you're farting and you're sitting there right fuck this song fuck this outfit fuck his head right yeah so you know so in my brother's defense even Billy from perfect circle it he's he's slow-moving as well but he has a lot of you know now started work on stuff that it's taken many years for him to kind of build up the cache of things that were you know we're digging into to look at things that have been in development for you know the last six eight ten years what you seem to have found this interesting balance because you're such a I mean you you have so many different things that require your focus but you're also so you you're you're one of those dudes it has to get shit done I've met a lot of guys like you they're just like I'm getting shit done like right you're either in my way are you gonna help me or you gonna get the fuck out of my way but I'm getting shit done and so you're like okay I can't get shit done over here I'm gonna get shit done over here I'm gonna go do this I'm gonna start a wine company now I'm making a restaurant oh look I have a juicy school look I wrote a book like you just constant with it's fascinating because you're also pretty at peace like you found like this strange balance of activity and then also relative isolation and your small area it took me a while to like you know my my desire to move forward go go go and get things done you know I'm always butting heads heads with and the guys in the band and in tool to get those things done and just it's just not their process so it took me a while for me to go this is not personal this is just them this is just the way that they have to do it and I have to respect it and I have to take my time and let them take their time and I just check in I just go I come and I see what's going on hey Justin send me send me the track see where we're at is this thing done if this thing is done done done and I can start writing words and music on it great but I've had instances where I started to write stuff and by the time I actually got it around and back and we're actually listening and whatever the talk had gone in a completely different direction so everything that was written melody wise or lyric wise was completely irrelevant now I have to start over is that weird because you guys aren't in the same location physically right right I mean I can sit there in that room and be with them in that room but their process is so tedious and so like Rain Man and then I just can't I I just like in folding in on myself like right back we'll make pasta okay I got a I'll be right back I gotta go take five years to plant a vineyard because you'll still be right where you were when I left but it's it's a great thing what they're doing is a wonderful I completely back what you're doing I'm saying is no other way to do it there's no other way for them to do it for me I can I can move much more quickly if you'll let if you'll let me help you I've done you know I've written a few songs in fact I was involved in many of them the ones that we've done so we could do that but I think this is what this is what they need to do and I'm okay with it I you know you got to get a little friction in there's had to come in and you know and puff my chest out a little bit and be aggressive and let's fucking let's move it guys let's move it and that works for a minute and we we definitely make traction but if I were to do that every day it would just become a part of the friction more friction rather than actually getting anything done it seems like one of the biggest problems with bands right is just getting to personalities together yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we're definitely very strong for very strong personalities you know same with Billy working with Billy with perfect circle he gets a little forest for trees sometimes and I'm like the guy go on what what they step back look at it and then I'm out the door for poor guys go home heard you go and them you know working with Matt Mitchell and Karina and in Puscifer we all generally work with or for other projects and other people so when we get together we are fucking streamline organized we go okay I'll check in with the guys and tool and go okay where we at what do we got are we there is it like are we gonna track tomorrow because we're gonna track tomorrow I can tell you great then this is we're gonna line this up but if we're not gonna track tomorrow and that's gonna take this much time well then I'm gonna do this other thing while we're tell me when that day is right when we're when we're ready to start when these are done I can take my time to write on I I mean and you know fairness I should take my ten years to write lyrics now but I won't do that right I'll I'll digest these things as quickly as I can and and and keep that moment that freshness of what my impressions are of the finished tracks and we'll start but nothing's you know nothing is tracked yet nothing is completely finished answer a couple songs that I think are finished now I can start working on those but nothing's actually recorded there's just all they're just written right so that leaves time so I can actually go and work with with Billy I can work with Matt Corrina and and get other things done in the interim so there's there's more you know when you write something like say if you have an idea if you're just sitting around you're like I have a thought do you just sit down and you go okay there's a tool song this is a perfect circle song this is a Puscifer song does it just like no because what I'm what I'm writing to is is the music that I'm hearing from those people so that's all you write to I write to the music because that way it's a unique it's a unique island situation those things are gonna whenever I've tried to write I've had some poetry sitting over here that I want to write mm-hmm and I tried to a force it on to a song for any of those projects it doesn't work it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't seem to fit so you need to hear the song I need to hear the finished thing you know if it almost finished thing and then put lyrics to it yeah yeah get them get the melodies in place get the rhythms as if I'm an instrument and is that how you guys did that Fibonacci song yeah yeah Wow yeah that was a really unique undertaking how what was the process behind that like did you did you say hey it would be a nifty idea I do something to a mathematical sequence no no that was a complete accident I think it was I think Adam or Justin who had the riff and at some point they were actually counting counting the riff and it ended up being in seven eight nine I think I was like I said a measure of seven a measure of measure of 9 and I'm not sure how you would actually write that out as a and note and notation but um you know I think 789 is a Fibonacci number just that you know the actual 789 mm thick I think I look at again it might be 980 some people don't know what the fuck we're talking about the Fibonacci sequence is a very unique mathematical sequence that appears in nature it's uh it's in fractals it's in sunflowers if you look at like the pattern of sunflower seeds if you look at Nautilus shells and what it is it's an expanding fractal sort of a mathematical equation I don't know if I'm saying it correctly but it's like the first step is 0 and then there's 1 and then 1 1 2 3 5 to 2 plus yeah and it just keeps going on so that's the that's the Fibonacci number like write a whole number like actual number sequence there's there's the Phi ratio where points 1.618 anything multiplied by the one point six pointed that that herb not not multiplied the relationship the difference the difference in the length from this finger to this finger as opposed to this finger that thing those those knuckles and your digits those are all in that in that relationship of 1.618 the Phi relationship so that the fractals as it's growing that progression is is that is that ratio and then the number breakdown is as you said it's 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 yo so likes 1 plus 1 is 2 2 plus 1 is 3 3 plus 2 is 5 5 plus 3 is 8 and it's like everything you you count you add what came before it and a spiral picture like of Giza Plateau showing you them well also facial structure which is really fascinating there's something about human facial structure that uses the Fibonacci sequence and I read something where about why people recognize plastic surgery while it disturbs them boom yeah it's like what's going on with the sequence like the sequence is off so my friend here it is the Fibonacci relationships of the human had and it's all I had a friend who said you know how when you know a you know of a family has had a child who has Down syndrome right there's there's a it crosses racial divides it just you can tell this this family has had that that child has Down syndrome there's no look that goes along with it they said it's the same look you know not the same look but like it's the same recognition of people who have had facial plastic surgery mmm you recognize you're not fooling anybody your honor you've done a thing that's recognizable universally as wrong something's wrong with your sons isn't it isn't off yeah it's off yeah but I thought it was funny that it was actually connecting it to down no disrespect to people with Down syndrome but yeah I know what you're saying yeah yeah but but it is like when you see someone with the disease like oh there's clearly an error here in the code yes yeah and the end of facial reconstruct the plastic surgery because I'm just oh shit I'm getting older you just a fool them well the nose thing too is weird like when someone has a uniquely small nose and they're in the face you know but they might have a long like Ari Shaffir type face but then they have this like shrunken down nose like hey yeah like this seems fucked right this doesn't there's a ratio that's supposed to exist it doesn't exist why your lips but you know you know in a in a in a way a song like Lata Ellis with the Fibonacci thing that's that's I feel like I kind of pulled a very pedestrian sophomoric move by including those numbers in there because in general music is the fire ratio everything everything that all nature all these things we're talking about it's already here by by pointing it out like staring at it and pointing at it with those numbers present and the way that the numbers and the lyrics are I feel like that you know it's good to let people know about it but I almost feel like it was kind of a it was kind of a dick joke you know way it's it's um I could do better that's interesting are you one of those ruthlessly introspective gods just yeah probably so probably so buddies any good at anything does that yeah no other way around good thing good thing I'm not good at anything it's almost like you have a guard dog that you turn on yourself yeah sit you know what I mean it's like you know I figure out what's wrong with me get him I mean me get me and then you uh yeah fire you're fucked I'm my own guard dog one shot to the dome I break the guard I punched through the guard my shots go through your guard keep your hands up you're fucked everyone's fucked yeah that's um that's a characteristic that I see in almost everybody that I respect they all think that everything they do sucks or at least they have very very high standards and an often disappointed by their own work well you know I think I have some of that but I also have that idea of like it's something that my thought I don't fight talked about my dad with you but um he was my wrestling coach in high school he was also my science biology and environmental studies teacher really she was my teacher oh what a drag went to school your dad being the T doesn't fucking but I learned a lot because he was no joke he didn't pull any punches for me he you know he drove me as hard if not harder than his other students you didn't show any favoritism but one of the things that was always his thing on the mat and I'm kind of paraphrasing but basically you you either win or you learn mm-hmm especially in that high school college setting you're you're you're learning about yourself if you if you went out there and you got your ass handed to you then you just got beat and didn't learn anything well yeah you're a fucking loser you take the moment reflect on it build on what you did wrong and you now you're actually in a way you've won if now you know more about yourself you know about more your your limitations or what you need to improve and expand your talents your your limitations so I guess whenever I'm doing a thing I'm always looking at it for a learning perspective so there aren't necessarily mistakes unless they're fatal and then you wouldn't know anyway so whatever that really is the right way to look at everything you win or you learn yeah you know you have great experiences because you're successful or you have very beneficial experiences because you realized what went wrong yeah but you just one more wrinkled one more piece of information or one more experience that you can add to your database of knowledge and it'll make you better at everything this so that in a lot of ways that's my biggest frustration in life is when there is something that kind of goes wrong and I can't figure out what it was mmm that's frustrating for me because I can't I can't build on I can't learn from it but I don't understand what what went wrong well there's a relationship or whether it's something I tried to build or something I did or how often does that happen uh a lot you know I you know there's a couple of times I've actually had an opportunity to do a vocal with somebody else as a guest singer and I've you know rehearsal was great and then you blew it for the main event and I'm like what did I do wrong I did everything the same and until you can actually pinpoint that and figure out what it was I'm a fucking mess like I'm slipping I'm waking up in the middle of the night trying to figure out what the fuck went wrong yeah that's the same with comedy cut that's one flub joke or one one premise that you botched and just wolf yeah you wake up I wake up to pee and go fuck you know just oh no I have to go downstairs and get in front of the computer and just start writing again you know I'll just get angry I just gotta fix this fucking thing a figure out what's wrong with it I'm gonna make it bulletproof yeah it's um you're a unique guy in that you you're you're all these different things that you're doing I feel like that kind of like works synergistically they have to yeah I don't feel like you're going it you don't think like you're battling your I know people that are battling themselves you know with all the different things we I think this all feeds everything the stories you know I'm a storyteller so I'm involved in a lot of life I'm trying I'm doing things on many levels because in order to tell a full more complete picture a better story having more information a good good actor is going to do his research on the character beyond the character he's gonna find out about the region the character supposedly from and write history their family's history and you know they're gonna add all these things then so that like when they have their one line all that history is behind their eyes mmm so I feel like that's you know for writing for why making they're all crossing over together they're all feeding each other to make it to make it a whole presentation yeah when you're managing the you know a crop of grapes and putting together a wine and you got a restaurant going on you're working on your jiu-jitsu and then you're writing songs you're living all these different experiences you have so much feeding into your consciousness there's so many variables that you're attending to that it just keeps your mind sharp and fresh and and it creates it mean not necessarily like conflict but issues there's live things that need to be figured out and solutions need to be created for problems it's not like there's something that happens to certain people they get too locked into one thing I feel that they just run out of juice they run out of things to discuss they run out of the run out of ran out of perspective yeah yeah I mean you're during the 70's 80's era of music coming out first two records are probably those people spent the whole their whole lives writing those two records right and the third record is all about the bus or the travel or the or the shitty record label or manager like it's all the road that's the road album right because where the fuck have they been for the last three years but in a bus or in an airport in hotel yeah so those and those albums end up being the ones that are make or break the band as far as getting past Passos thing and generally I'm speaking very generally of course yeah but it's the same with comics it's this with comics it's usually you have one or two good specials and then there's a big drop-off you know I think it's guys running out of stuff to talk about and usually you work for like 10 years before you do anything before you release anything they're the best guys it seems like they worked like 10 10 years and then they put out an album or a comedy special or whatever it is and then you just your your life is about performing your life is about doing that thing you don't have enough options outside of that like a lot of comics turn to airline jokes and you know and things like hotels and you start talking about that like that's your experience he's constantly being on what's what you're exposed to talking about what you know write what you know yeah and that's what you all you know now is a fucking delayed flight but I don't know anybody else is doing it like your way like rock-style way also runs a vineyard it's like also regularly change jujitsu Daniel day-lewis sort of right yeah eggs hats or something yeah I can make shoes of shoes yeah yes shoes I want a pair of Daniel day-lewis shoes isn't that what he's doing I feel like he's making shoes well I don't you know a lot of actors I you know have met that have gotten on a roll with a good series TV series a lot of them will say the same thing like about a couple of seasons in you know you start looking at the door because you're acting muscle can start to atrophy if you're only being this guy on that show for eight years do they start going crazy and going into drugs and buying houses yeah yeah so you start to you start to do a little spiral so you know to get out and be able to do a few films gliding out like William Peterson was on CSI the Vegas CSI so ever he does theatre no yeah I would think you would have to that's the guy from to live and die in LA yep even forgot about that movie Manhunter people yeah that was the original Hannibal Lecter movie with a different guy of the Nancy Hopkins it was a great movie great so forgotten moving yeah to live and die in LA is a forgotten movie I he's had a great fucking movie Brian Cox is dr. Lecter and there he is a handsome bastard right yeah look at him and it's just his sharpening his chops on the theater stage because he's a true that guy's that guy's the real deal but he's on CSI to get paid yeah I guess initially I think most likely when that when that whole new era of TV was coming out I probably seemed like a good idea for him to kind of just that you know he probably had some bills to pay and he would get on there thinking it was gonna be a couple seasons and she's gonna get out of there but the contract and they're going keep your own if you do this but I want to do this theater thing I want to go do I know Shakespeare in the Park and then punish you if you leave - yeah black bar you that's motherfucker I'll leave a series yeah yeah so ruin this I don't know I don't know I don't know him I don't know his decisions but I think speaking to a lot of different people that have been in the situation it's definitely yeah you're kind of weighing it out like if I just stick with this thing for six seasons a season I have enough money in the bank for the rest of my life yeah and then I'll have to fight my way back and a couple years of detoxing from that very it could be a great situation yeah well you see I think it makes people go crazy I think that's what happened that Johnny Depp you know Johnny Depp when he started doing those Pirates of the Caribbean movies you know it's interesting like Johnny Depp at one point Tom and I'm a giant dead fan I think he's a great actor seems like a wild dude and he's buddies with my friend Stanhope in Stanhope loves him so there's got to be a good guy have a lot of mutual friends I have never actually I met him a long long long long time ago but yeah he used to do these weird projects strange movies and he even said once I don't want to be blocked best blockbuster boy yeah dead man that black and white yeah that black and white western Arizona dream Joe went out that's right yeah fantastic he did a lot of really cool weird projects and then he did the Pirates of the Caribbean and that fucking group of movies has been so wildly successful that he's just made ungodly amounts of money to the point where he was spending so much fucking money they had some breakdown because he's in some involving some lawsuit with his former manager there see suing his former manager he was spending 150 thousand dollars a month on private security 24 hours a day spending $200,000 a month on private jets and then just going on and on and on a staff of 40 people he management no Johnny Depp Johnny Depp a staff of 40 people maintained something like 15 different homes all over the world just Paul went out of control just so ballin out of control putting in fuckin corner we bring him in what is this among his most extravagant expenses listed in the counter suit worth three million dollars spent to blast Hunter Thompson's ashes out of a cannon and thirty thousand dollars a month spent on wine the New York Post gossip column page six reported yeah well they're the same cunt it said that Ronda Rousey and Travis Browne are washed up losers yeah I don't know if they're right what does this house they're showing what about paid though let's talk about skin hey blow up like the world trade Johnny Depp's chateau in the South of France ooh Wise's chateau have a restaurant with an awning and a logo on it that doesn't even make sense does its own restaurant how ball were they overthinking it maybe it's his restaurant yeah but I mean like for himself only like he shows up uh table for two sir yeah can I get on the list a strange character it's a strange character I think that's what happened he started buying all that shit when he got that Pirates of the Caribbean money because you don't really want to be Jack Sparrow every fucking day like I want to do something else you can't do something else and every time he does something else just like the Pirates of the Caribbean guy does you know like how many different movies has he done since you've done the Pirates of the Caribbean couple couple yeah that's right he did Edward Scissorhands oh no he did the Alice in Wonderland thing since the parts of the Caribbean that was actually really good it was weird I enjoyed it but I enjoyed it yeah well they won't go yeah there's a lot of weird shit anyway point being they go crazy they just start they start spending buying stop buying and spending get caught no weird hues and a downward spiral what does this movie yeah that's right the 10 worst Johnny Depp movies wasn't that a guy that like died and came back to life or something like that or he had the Lone Ranger come back to life and he helped him come back to life curl comes back to life or something I think that's cultural appropriation because I don't believe that he's Indian so I'm offended how come they couldn't get a Native American some say the Indian yeah that's a yeah I have a hard time with all that I'm you know I what so okay you have you own guns yes okay but you're you know your pot smoker yes you're would you consider yourself a liberal I'm more liberal than I am conservative for sure okay so there's there's that balance you think the mcribs like that you know don't call me I would like to be now from out you know I'm an I'm an avocado I relate to avocados so as my my sexuality I relate to an avocado so and don't I think you're allowed to identify as an avocado now okay so that that thing just you know there's again we need a meteor I guess what it comes back with guns and avocado yeah but like you know just that whole the politically correct thing but then the anti intellectualism that comes from what I would consider the the lower right yeah there's a far right that it does go anti intellectualism and then there's far left that even though they might be more well read and maybe intellectual they put up these blinders to certain patterns of thinking as well I mean there's a there's there's not a lot of like across-the-board objectivity there's a lot of people formulating these preformed patterns of opinions that you know can conservative opinions and just concluding to it or liberal opinions and clinging to it I think the most people know Frye area yeah if you're meteor lots of great a lot of gray area yeah meteor I think most people really share like ideas that are conservative and liberal and I think what's really important we should be able to discuss these ideas without digging our heels and and just like being fully committed to one team or the other team that's where the problem lies people are so tribal whether it's conservative or liberal even libertarian they go real tribal and they just like lock onto those ideas and this is right and that is wrong and you know and it just people don't want they don't want to give in and so then they fight then they dig their heels in and they they know they fight their opinion I'm an armed snowflake is that is that a new category you could do that yeah it's a be able to do that why not so who can stop you from being an armed snowflake you have bullets and shit you know regular snowflakes don't have bullets Superman you know I think man I think we're we're moving into a new stage of humanity is as profound and ridiculous and you know verbose as that sounds I really think that's what's going on and I think all this in fighting and squabbling is we're trying to find our footing trying to figure out what we are and what we're doing and guns are part of that it's like should you be allowed to just have that like I don't know every now and then it goes wrong well if it goes wrong would you want to be able to protect yourself yeah you got a point no you don't have a point no one should have one yeah but what about when the bad people come should you have one then no she's what the bad people kill you and then it's all bad people alive and the good people are dead well who's that - who's this determined what if a good person gets a hold of it and they do a bad thing like there's all these variables but I don't think I don't think it's that cut and dry and I also think it's a lot like everything else here media me what part if you were looking at a part of the world without pissed anybody off without pissing anybody off no we're not gonna care this is like a billion people so we lost a half a million fucking mouth we have to wipe out like Latvia Riga boom and then bears more like that sure I've seen did you watch the the leftovers yes I watched the first episode yeah it's I like you know I think the I love I love watching weird actors Flexer their moves I love it so I love that series because they get better after the first episode they like set a bunch of stuff up yeah I mean I was a lot of setup but you the concept right away storyteller I love a good story a huge percentage of the population just fucking vanishes with no explanation I'm in right I'm in and all the psychological and all the religious stuff that unfolds and collapses and builds up and freaks out based on that I think if we're going to do something like that it would have to be spontaneous combustion from a percentage of the globe mmm across the board no no you know there's worse in the flames yeah that's a real thing five percent of five percent of the population spontaneously combusting at the same time across the globe in front of people and no explanation no explosion now we're gonna talk I don't think that's enough I think it's got it something's got to hit us because then you'd be like well from the UFC camp you want to see me more maybe fuck you and fuck your hits I'm all for people burn and spawn to remember when we were kids like spontaneous combustion was a thing you would wonder maybe one of your friends would burst into flames while you're in school yeah when they're lighting farts or something is that real spontaneous human combustion is it truly real I don't know how spontaneous human combustion works mate a little bigger swagger Rita in December 1966 the body of a 96 year old dr. Jay Irving Bentley was discovered in his pennsylvania home by a meter reader actually only part of dr. Bentley's leg and slippered foot were found the rest of his body had been burned to ashes a hole in the bathroom floor was the only evidence of the fire that had killed him the rest of the house remained perfectly intact how could a man catch fire with no apparent source of a spark or flame and then burned so completely without igniting anything around him said the Washington Post yeah dr. Bentley's case in several hundred others like it have been labeled spontaneous human combustion although he and other victims of the phenomenon burned almost completely their surroundings and even sometimes their clothes remained virtually untouched well that's just fucking bullshit who what what website is this listen bitch if you're on fire fucking close gonna catch fire too unless someone's using pixie magic on you are they did you get hit with a magic wand wielded by an elf you've cut your fucking clothes are gonna burn stupid if you're burning your clothes are burning this is horseshit okay if spontaneous human combustion isn't real then what really occurred to the many pictures that exist of charred bodies a possible explanation is the wick effect which produces proposes that the body when lit by a cigarettes molding ember or other heat source acts much like an inside-out candle a candle is composed of a wick on the inside surrounded by a wax made of flammable fatty acids the wax ignites the wick and keeps it burning in the human body the body's fat acts as a flammable substance and the victims clothing or Hale hair acts as the wick as the fat melts from the heat it soaks into the clothing and acts as a wax-like substance to keep the wick burning slowly scientists say this is why the victims bodies are destroyed yet their surroundings are barely burnt whoa so they're so fat that we become like a big greasy candle says no one's actually no one's ever conclusively proven or disproven the truth of spontaneous human combustion but most scientists say that there are more likely explanations for the charred remains like your wife fucking hates you she hate you in the head with a frying pan let your ass on fire threw you in the tub and say I don't even know what happened I think it's one of them Ripley's Believe It or Not things and then you know she's seen in the embrace of the hardware store manager I was crying and Stanley helped me what she did yeah I don't think it's real I cried bullshit that's why and that's why it would make so much more of an impact if it happened to 5% of the population not even me I think an outside threat for another planet like an impact is like a wake-up call and now it's like spontaneously think about it now if aliens showed up and started shooting people from spaceships everyone's gonna go that's bullshit that's the government could be right but an asteroid you would realize the government can't recreate something the size of a city all right it's slamming into the planet that's what's gonna happen yeah but it's weird like we care we care in a big way how people die right like 9/11 was huge cuz people caused 3,000 people to die and the world changed radically because of those 3,000 deaths but half a million people die every year because of cigarettes a half a million just in this country alone and we're like yeah yeah whatever like it doesn't bother us whether you die that way well you die choking on your on pus-filled lungs in some sort of urgent care center that doesn't bother us as much like that's a shitty smoked but you get caught in the 500th floor of some fucking skyscraper and get hit in the face take 13 there's a there's some good there's a lot of good books on those kind of things that and that just you know something like the Holocaust in general just the intent and the focus and the hatred toward a specific group of people it has way more impact than the cigarette the cigarette smoke the cigarettes don't have they're not angry and they're not hateful right that death is not doesn't you don't doesn't hurt you as much as if you have the impact of a group of people hating another group of people so much to think they kill them in a mass you know in a mass event it's kind of insidious though if you really look at it objectively look it's okay as long as they peacefully suck the vitality out of your body with chemical dip plants wrapped in paper that they trick you into sucking on once you light them on fire and your body becomes a custom and addicted to it and we're like hey it's a it's a stress relieving choice it looks great don't smoke too much just as long as you only smoke a little you'll be fine what are the statistics on that like secondhand second hands bad to people waitresses and stuff and in bars they do get a lot of them will get cancer and people that lived with people that were chronic smokers but they weren't smokers themselves a lot of them got cancer secondhand smoke especially in a small Daria's reels fuck it's not as bad as the cigarettes themselves but you should have seen the first clue would have been like as soon as they seriously pulled smoking off of planes oh yeah there must be a problem do the planes or did cuz we are having to pay there are some flight attendants cancer yeah that would be why those things were ridiculous I remember these to blow smoke in the back and if you want exception yeah non-smoking section separated by space that's it separated in a tube secondhand smoke causes approximately seven thousand three hundred thirty three deaths from lung cancer and thirty three thousand nine hundred fifty deaths from heart disease every year between 64 and 2014 2 tau 2 point 5 million people died from exposure to secondhand smoke so it's not quite as bad it's about you know 20,000 as opposed to 500,000 mm-hmm but still it's darren's a lot yeah it's not as bad but it's still fucking terrible it's weird he's not he's like searching what are you doing while we're not talking about sorry are you constantly sorry on his phone hey Siri what's going on with satellites are they real hey Siri what's up with that ice wall in America oh my god yeah there's a fucking chunk of ice that they've been monitoring a glacier that's the biggest glacier the world has ever known is the size of Delaware and it's floating around in the ocean now it is so unbelievably massive you could be standing on this glacier and not see the end of it you wouldn't see how far it's floating and this iceberg I should say it's floating it broke off ten things that are smaller than the iceberg rate oh Jesus Christ it's so big it's very Grand Canyon it's the Grand Canyon is smaller the Great Salt Lake is smaller Long Island is smaller Luxembourg is smaller lake okeechobee in Florida is smaller Los Angeles is smaller than this fucking iceberg Lake Champlain in New York is smaller New York City is smaller than this fucking earthquake or earthquake this iceberg that's the same so it's separated do they have a satellite image of this thing it's separated and floated off and it's gonna come slamming right into the Santa Monica Pier look at that you can see it as they fly over it does the crack that's oh my god look at that photo that's fucking insane the photo is uh someone took it from a plane you're looking down with the wings and where was it was it in Greenland where where did it break off Antarctica Antarctica but there is that the ice wall what did separates us from a flat earth there's all these assholes and so you can't fly over Antarctica online you you absolutely can you piece of shit know that Anthony Bourdain just filmed the show from there he was in Antarctica you dumb cunts he filmed the show you landed in Antarctica he talked to the people that work in the science department there whatever the fuck they do running experiments trying to keep the Russians from invading mm-hmm all that yeah get him up - we should get up to Jerome Jerome yeah let's get him to come try the wine or take him out of the vineyards and we have to raining yeah I just I think it'd be good a good show to combine them the wine the pasta the local food I sense competitive aggression from you know you're sensing that because you're projecting it hmm no no I'm good no I think I'm not drunk anymore I'm not lying dude that to definitely get him up there and get him some good but he would do it for sure yeah he would film at your place and be a good thing to do maybe I could have helped orchestrate that not yet there'll be a dopey dopey ID of that be a dope episode for his show you know and you also have a very unique story to like doing your thing out there in Arizona and look man for him it's an opportunity to do some jiu-jitsu that guy's an addict yeah he does it every day yeah he's amazing yeah when we were in Montana we filmed an episode of his show he went to maybe it was Bozeman I think it was Bozeman II just found some local jiu-jitsu club was rolling with these guys he didn't even know him just gets in there and starts training with him he's an animal that's awesome he doesn't fuck around he doesn't not over see way like 180 well he's very tall I think he's like at least six three and he's thin he's lost a ton of weight he lost thirty pounds from doing jiu-jitsu he was on all sorts of he was on statins for high blood pressure high cholesterol because of his diet and sedentary lifestyle and you know he was like well you know I have the choice between changing what I eat right I don't want to do that I want to keep eating pork and all these delicious foods or taking these statins so he just decided to take the statins but once you start arranging it so he got off all that shit yeah just his body just responded to the demands yeah your body responds to the demands you know I think that's a one of them unheralded factors in people's obesity is not just the diet which is all a huge factor for sure but also the requirements that you're asking of your body only bodies are not used to sitting around doing up go do get up go do get go eat go off so can't can I ask a USD question yes please do what's the what's the Hollywood babble-on about over what happened with Nunez well she got something called sinus Titus she has apparently like severe sinus infections that affect her balance and they get really bad yeah and she got one the day of the weigh-ins she made it through the weigh-ins and then she was having like a serious episode to the point where they checked her into the hospital and the word was that she wanted to compete but her coaches did not want her to compete they look look you're having like a really hard time like walking like apparently when your sinuses get like really inflamed it fucks with your equilibrium inner ear yeah this is second and third-hand by the way right I didn't talk to her right and you know that's what you'd have to do you'd have to have her talk about it but it's super unfortunate because that was in well in my opinion was the highest level women's MMA bout ever in terms of the overall ability of the two athletes I think valentina Shevchenko and Amanda Nunez they represent the peak yep these are the this is the best we've ever seen yeah Nunez is a ruthless knockout striker she beat the shit out of Ronda Rousey and she choked the shit out of me today she's a real legit black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu knockout striker and then Valentina Shevchenko is a Muay Thai champion ridiculous stand up and you know she caught Giuliana pinion with an arm bar from the guard like her ground game is nasty too right me penny is legit for her to catch Pena with an arm bars that's staggering and her striking is so good like you saw in the Holly Holm fight she shot Holly Holm down whereas like I mean Holly Holm fucked up Germaine Duran to me with a question mark kick dropped her with a straight left hand she never had close to that kind of success against Valentina right Valentina's super high level with her striking her movement she fights southpaw and she is that beautiful check right hook that she throws it like keeps everybody minding their P's and Q's she's in a super well-rounded game so it's really unfortunate that those two didn't go at it but it's gonna be a good fight I think they're gonna schedule it again for the the event that is after the end of July event I think it's 2:15 they're gonna schedule at 4:00 but then you know like Dana White said now Amanda Nunez would never headline in the van again and I just don't think you can force someone to fight if she really did have a significant and injury like they said that the doctors cleared her to fight you know a significant illness I should say she they said the doctor is clear to fight but she chose not to that was like the company word but if she's like was that fucked up I just can't imagine she wasn't that fucked up I mean it's gotta suck if you spent millions of dollars promoting a fight and then here it is and then if people bought the pay-per-view and then it falls par and you got to give refunds and I don't know welcome to welcome to the music industry when it was that it's you know it's big peak in the 90s and people are like writing big checks for stuff and like I yeah this is gonna be gonna get Mariah Carey for millions of dollars here's her thing and then she goes she has a meltdown she went crazy oh yeah and then like they're like what did we just spend our money on what happened just now mmm I don't know I care you go crazy what happened I don't I think she meltdown Oh than one of those maybe she got a bad dick Wow longer if you catch a bad dick walk I've never personally I've never caught a bad dick so if you got a dick I have not that I'm aware of convict dick you catch an ambivalent dick I have not caught a man building dick yeah I keep going I'm gonna make there might be one in there somewhere I wonder I wonder I mean it's got it's got to be away yeah I don't know but you know somebody wrote a big check you have an artist who had a meltdown didn't deliver because it's you're talking about where we are merchants of emotion that's what we do right and sometimes it can overwhelm that isn't over that is a you know volatile thing and it's stories all this time and you know with fighters one little dumb thing walking up the stairs to the Octagon he can pull you know your ACL fucking separates from your body yeah you could slip you Kevin Randleman was backstage preparing for a fight once and he stepped on a pipe and slipped and fell on his head and was concussed yeah like right before the main event right before the main event he was walking backstage he stepped on something slipped his leg went on he hit his fucking head and he was concussed and they canceled the fight yeah that was like like a mess I want to say that was in 1997 or 1998 or somewhere around there and it was like what yeah that can happen for sure and then for a fighter there's so much about who they are is dependent upon their confidence in their state of mind and if she hears that the UFC is pissed at her she had to pull out of the fight and then they say that they'll never have her headline an event again I mean she goes from being this superstar with two spectacular performances against the most popular women's fighters of all time those two between Miesha Tate and Ronda Rousey I would say arguably the most popular women fighters of all time coincidentally they're both the hottest how weird mm-hmm you know like you got if you're gonna be a chick and you got to be a fighter it's it helps a lot if your heart doesn't I I'm that hot and I'm not a chick I noticed both of those things I don't want to bring it up though I didn't want to rub your face right but yeah I mean she's who knows she's gonna bounce back from that sucks it sucks for Valentina to write she gets through the weigh-ins she gets through the weight cut she gets to like I mean I like that a home home is one in uh in Singapore that was a wonderful that was great boom yeah she's that question mark kick that same kick she throws that kick so well that's a sneaky-ass fucking kick man when you think it's gonna be a round kick to the body or a low kick and then it comes up high and clangs you in the dome yeah it's so good the way they throw that too because it comes in like this and they're loops over crying she might be the best in the world out in MMA Luke Rockhold 'he's got a really good one too he used it against Bisping in their first fight they throw it and it's such a unusual motion of a kick it looks like it's coming up and then it just goes whip over the top pull up Luke Rockhold Kos Michael Bisping he actually dropped him with it and then he caught him with a guillotine choke afterwards and tapped him with a guillotine but the way he throws that kick it's like it's fucking super Sneaky who's coming up there's some there's a Maia fight coming up in there yeah um UFC 119 is this the right one is this the one when he won or is this the one I'm not sure this is the one we're Bisping chaos him yeah see right there climb right yeah go to the first one their first fight their first fight is the one he choked him out he didn't K ohm but he clanged them with this the question mark kick yeah I don't go with ko versus Bisping one yeah guillotine here it is you got jack'd yeah this is some guy holding up a camera I did it man the UFC takes a lot of those things down I think Rockhold guillotine choke first time best Bing taps yeah this is it cuz he was wearing a beard at the time interesting they fought two times you know and then Rockhold thought it was gonna be an easy fight the second time when he got I think it's right before that no no it's hard to tell but anyway it's a it's such an unusual movement what is this just a bunch of highlights there it is right there but they don't show the whole kick they just show the the actual end of it as its landing yeah whatever you have to show it your point being Holly has got one of the best she's she's interesting because she's a combination of a boxer she was like a world champion boxer I think like eighteen time world champion boxer but she also has like traditional karate techniques she throws like a lot of sidekicks and like these weird round kicks yeah she key eyes when she throws shots yeah there it is cut clang yeah and that was after bets go hey I was kind of like taunting her yeah white whoopsies yeah that high kick man that left high kick that's her highlight reel move man that's the one that separates did you get me you can eat crap for our our arsonist video for me and my me fighting Ronda Rousey you know another thing good no good no one gave me a hard time never you know I don't yeah I don't really know Holly or any of these guys and I they were you know they were the fantastic five and there I wasn't sure like I might come out like you know I was almost Trump supporter like oh crap no everybody thought it was funny like it didn't you got you got away with that one hey but maybe now that we're talking about it people gonna review it because the standards over the last two months have probably changed and people decided more things are offensive now that we're then yeah hurry up get on that because you know yeah yell at me about that people are super uptight about what is offensive and what isn't offensive and it moves it moves like the tide comes in it comes out there it is you could play it I want to play the whole thing how long any minutes is it four minutes but victorious and with my junk intact people need to show Intel we know how good Ronda is this could be epic that was a joke broken not to be confused with Conor McGregor you gave Ronda Rousey a very manly appearance I did nothing with a sort of way - what's going on here just after some having a lunch for a specific diet [Music] for people at home were watching animation if you're just listening Rhonda's hitting the speed bag right now looking very angry Mainers taking steroid Mainers shooting steroids and it's a badass because I don't I don't want to lose my junk I like how you have tits I know why did you decide to have tits no I don't just onions I feel like it's a gender appropriation it might be it is a man with tits if you don't claim trans I got yelled at like just goes what do you have against people that are you know like transgender like you know you're giving up your junk if you lose to Ronda like that's a bad thing okay it's okay in a bet here's how it works you have something that you want to hang on to and keep where I have something I want to hang on to a keep whether it's money or whatever and the bet is that if you lose you have to give up the thing that you want to keep yeah you don't you don't lose a bet and then give up something you were willing to get rid of anyway of course right so if you're a person who doesn't want your joke just that's the choice you've made then don't you know that's not really a bet but if he's different if you're a person who wants to hang on to your junk and you bet your junk away that's I want my junk nope no disrespect to Mary who does not want their junk you want to give away if you want to cut your shit off that's fine I don't care but I want I would like to keep my junk yeah that is what my wife my wife wants me to keep my junk I think that's a really reasonable request and this in this video you made Donald Trump to be a giant monster that must be put down Trump Silla now do you worry that like the what they call now the Kathy Griffin effect could possibly happen people get to hold this video I think that you were my career was over a long time I don't think her career's over I just think it's shifted it's shifted it's moved to a different place well she's universally hated by the right yeah she wasn't before it you know she was just kind of Kathy Griffin yeah now she's like enemy of this state see I just just her trying to be relevant it didn't work yeah exactly right that's exactly what it was who is this one with the demon said it wasn't her it was supposed to be me should tape but I was trying to be kind oh so you turned into a demon instead yeah hmm cuz she came out and supported Trump so I was a bit of bitchy I was gonna throw under the bus she made some statements early out like around that time but uh I was like you know what I'm not she might have meant something else so I made them because it used to have her name under her there as her as the Trump minion I like how the hair is like all crazy like you get underneath the hair it's like scalp but it comes over the top and crushes you from two bald guys don't you want to just talk to him about that hair and go dude you are wasting so much time and effort on that disaster yeah keep it on top of your head but it doesn't again it might be just a part of the part of a thing that could just keep that going like the Don King thing like it's all part of like he's got to know people have better haircuts than him right yeah but he doesn't care right that's maybe part of the whole we're gonna do it do it like yeah make it look like a hat for real hot yeah it's part of the whole theatrics is spraying everything down and locking it in place well you got she got your balls in a jar that's very triggering that triggers you its prop its problematic you got to be careful these days man yeah can't have balls in a jar and make it seem like it's a bad thing if someone identifies with the type of person that wants to have their balls in a jar how do you feel about transracial people meteor I need a meteor II for all of you everybody wears it it if you okay let's say if your god you're making you're gonna make me say where it's gonna hit ya where does it go where does it go that doesn't it most how big is it huge five mile no five miles long would kill everybody that's like what killed the dinosaurs we need like a football-field-sized meteor like a hundred North 100 yards North Pole's not good enough North Pole is gonna cause affects around all of the Shores below it interesting let's look at the world where do we hit it I'm looking at China bro I feel like they could take the hit I feel like they need a solution anyway they got a real problem there's a billion people over there so you're saying it has to be a populated area uh-huh yeah but maybe like weird like maybe you'll in like right where they eat the dogs maybe we go to the dog festival just and then like everybody goes hey man maybe you should need dogs God decided to hurl a meteor at all those assholes that are killing people's pets they're killing people yes what if it's five slightly smaller meteors and they hit every like Oh most continents that's not a bad idea but I think we need one big one and I think that Yulin takes the hit I was watching these videos where they they were capturing dogs stealing people's pets and they're cooking them sick boy meat yeah let's go let's just put it there that's the spot let's just put it right where they make the dog meat like randos they're cooking up the dog meat dog ramen shaking which I probably should go pick up my dog now what's up I gotta cook my dog to the groomer did you really oh yeah you took your dog out here did you drive or do you fly i fly i flew do you put your dog in the bottom with the regular dog she's she's with me so she sits with you yeah now do you have to make sure that the person next to you isn't gravely of allergic to dogs does who have to make sure you welcome no fucking but you have to tell the airline hey I'm traveling with my emotional support dog because I'm very fragile I'm traveling with my emotional support dog because in theory perhaps this might have happened to someone that we might know you're getting on an airline and they look at your you're paying for a dog to go on the flight mm-hmm right I'm paying extra for the dog to go on the flight sir does your dogs dang fit under the seat in front of you as a fit yes it's this regulation is what you want under the seat in front of you great ooh your other bag is too big but that's my that's my carry-on bag yeah but now that you're bringing a dog on that is your carry-on bag and that bag you have does it fit under the seat in front of you which is where my dogs gonna be right it's what do you do so you had to chide to check the bag so you check the bag and the dog stays under the seat um but the dog doesn't really fit under the seat yeah it's she's 11 pounds she's small but you can't like stuff her into that crack where the laptop bag goes really yeah she small dogs in Yorkie oh okay yeah so the point is that if I had a care if had a personal item that goes and right if that goes under the seat in front of me and the rolling bag goes up in that upper space that you have paid for right right but they're telling me like no the dog is now the the carry-on bag but I'm not so you want me to put my dog in the overhead bin no it has to go into the seat in front of you but you told me that carry-on bags go in the overhead bin it's all this like red tape catch-22 crap but as your dog of an esa is it a emotional support animal it can be does it have to be yeah because if you have that then we don't charge you anything and you can actually bring on all three of those items dog your carry-on and your personal item bring three bags on if your dog is an emotional support animal so if you're not follically for me I can't fly without my dog okay I get it I get it I think Natasha has that deal too Natasha Leggero she has an emotional port dog yeah that's uh that's a gross loophole and you I applaud you for capitalizing on it it's a way to go unless you're sitting next to someone who's like I'm terribly alone I need a moment I need a moment yeah man get your collect your emotions the dogs aren't even here to support you how do you get through a podcast I have the dog and you're like I I pretend that the American Werewolf in London was my dog okay that's good move that's good move yeah you like a dog by proxy yeah yeah it's weird is it a weird thing that that was never around we're kids that's why I had to pull this out emotional support dog because you're fucking weak your mind is weak and you're fucked you're fucked you can't even go to the fuckin Starbucks without bringing you dog in with you I think you're allowed to do that I mean I think that's part of it like if you have the paperwork you can go into play anywhere that yes you're not supposed to have it there's a restaurant that I go to that one of those ladies used to be hot back in the dizzay and that she's to be on that Desperate Housewives show now she's kind of getting up there in the years and getting a little whackier and whackier I'm sure as time goes on she brings in a full-grown golden lab this silly bitch his dog is like sitting down where everybody's Forks goes dirty assholes touching the ground where people accidentally drop their spoon it's just it's such a big dog it's so gross there's like something about a little dog sitting in someone's lap at a restaurant that's like it seems stupid but maybe not so bad but a lab yeah fucking 70 pound big-ass dog laying on the ground and this crazy bitch is putting everybody else imposing her situation on everybody else she knows it's nuts so do you think that people that go down that and I think actors do this knowing that go down that hardcore ketogenic diet that they cut all the carbs out of their diet sugars do you think it's too if they do it long enough to start to get a little dingy it could happen definitely you get the keto flu when you first start out yeah I got that that can push people over the top but you got to do it smart can't work out too hard and you first start doing it and you got to take exogenous ketones that's a big big that's helped me a tremendous amount what you saw just ketones ladies and gentlemen there's a bunch of different companies the one I use is called kee genex they have a new one called kee Gen X prime it's apparently even better but what it is is uh it's it's kamasutra to a bunch of amino acids and minerals and stuff that puts your body into a state of ketosis okay and it it allows you to like balance out it's like it's very good to balance out gives you energy when you're sort of struggling through that keto flu thing mm-hmm and then eventually your body adapts body gets used to burning fat and then it just seems like it has more energy when you do that but first I really truly be effective don't you have to kind of work got like two hours a day to really make it no no no you could definitely make it flip without working out that much you don't have to work out that much you just your body has to realize like okay carbs aren't coming in we're gonna need to burn fats which it has as a sort of a go-to way like we've been eating fats and people than relying on fats forever it's not a negative like people have this idea that the brain relies only on but can you have any kind of carbs at all you have to get past a certain amount of time or like these are people have just given that up forever no you can have some carbs your body has a certain amount of flexibility to it but the way they've done it well here's a perfect example of how much biodiversity is when it comes to your body's ability to absorb carbohydrates and how it reacts Rob Wolfe who is a scientist and big paleo researcher guy he's got an interesting Instagram page and on his I think it's dass Rob Wolfe is his Instagram but what he does is he'll eat something and they'll have his wife eat something and then they'll do these tests you know like blood tests to find out where their ketones are and whether or not they're in a ketogenic state and his body's like way more fragile in terms of like it's getting knocked off the ketosis then his wife's body okay his wife just rebounds but which is better genetics for it so it's pretty clean they're you know they obviously live together they're eating the same foods so it's there's a lot of variables involved in look at how your body processes carbs and it could you know it's like some people have celiac some people are gluten sensitive some people you know some people have no problem eating a big bowl of rice and they stay in ketosis and with some people that just knocks them right out of it and their body goes right back to burning carbs it depends also on how strict you've been in the ketogenic diet and how long you've done it for right there's a lot of critics of that diet too there's a lot of people that cry bullshit on that I don't know if they're crying I think some of the people that cry bullshit though they don't really have much of a science background and they're just they're just they're also been much nicer in the way I combined three things I tried to stick as close as I could to the ketogenic diet but I probably wasn't a ketogenic diet that I wasn't eating any sugar any fruit any carbs yeah that I you know that I know I was eating within a 10 hour window so if I got up at 10 a.m. and I had anything to eat I didn't eat anything after 8:00 hmm and I was trying to work out you know do something for an hour a day that's a well that's a great combination of mostly ketogenic or ketogenic and this the fasting what you're doing is intermittent fasting by going 14 hours everyday without eating that apparently is a really good protocol for losing weight I've done it I like it I think it makes me feel good to put your body in good place your body gets accustomed to only eating for eight hours a day mm-hmm and then the other hours you just don't eat just normal six sixteen hours you're just no eating it's a tough one do most people it is but especially on the road I'm like I'm having to eat after I perform and it's like okay that means I can't eat until yeah afternoon I don't fuck with it on the road yeah on the road the most important thing to me is nutrition we're sleep and recovery and exercise if I don't exercise when I'm on the road I get off because you know the flying and everything I feel like your body needs to exert it in order to release endorphins and sort of like that's why as soon as I walked in that door here I grabbed the kettlebell because I just haven't been able to do any of that stuff for a minute and so I've been here been and basically on my back for the last three days like got some weird stomach thing where I don't about bad piece of baked brie or something it's like knives in my stomach for two days they'd agree I don't blame you on cheese I'm blaming it on I was gonna blame it on you but cohhd cohhd breathe I'm gonna talk to baked brie again today are you one of those raw cheese guys do you prefer the raw cheese I like I like cheese I try not to eat a lot of it just because again anything that's too much of anything is too much so yeah I agree but what I found is that raw milk and raw cheese in particular both those things I seem to digest them way easier than I do the pasteurized and homogenized first yes I mean but are you how are you getting it are you getting it that I actually have that in the u.s. because oh yeah you can get raw cheese at Whole Foods okay yeah they sell these yeah yeah I can get the foreign yeah but like they actually making cheese in the US it's good question it's a awful hurdle like it wasn't yeah because they want you to pasteurize everything their cheese in the US isn't nearly as wonderful and tasty as it is from in your seas just because of all the process that you've actually had like raw stuff from a farm and go check it out dude I have burrata cheese in Italy I was like how do I get this home you don't you move to Italy did you even take burrata on an airplane would they let you cut it am I not right smuggle it well I had a friend who's French and he came here picturing it right now right well balloon I had a friend who's French from France and he had to hide his cheese because he had raw cheese he had to hide it in his luggage so yeah they're like folded up inside his pants like these bricks of wheels of cheese he had to like put his parents on stuffing in his luggage to hide cheese he's made it back in yeah he was his name in his address I told Ken tell ya and you actually moved back to France he's like fuck this place but when he lived here they used to make this raw cheese and like a charcuterie plate they would like cook raw cheese and melted on like the different smoked meats and oh I forget the name of it the name of the dish but it was sensational and they would eat it with like sauerkraut the art of eating yeah the art of eating and food it's a real art right yeah yeah I think the trick when you get into that you started getting at that gluttonous activity with your with your with your world you it's the moderation part because you didn't caught up and like Morse better and cramming it in and just being able to slow down and actually enjoy those experiences without just without going full-blown Girardi Pardo but if he put like a plate of prosciutto in front of me I'm fucked for a week cuz I'll eat all of it I will - yeah I eat that stuff a lot because it's it's healthy it's like if you get like real good naturally cured you get a lot of healthy fats from it so it's a great way to get a little package of protein you know you just open it up and dig in there it's a good key too like snack they did that one yeah I always recommend mark Sissons book the primal blueprint and he's the guy though that came on the podcast and apparently he's incorrect about some wine stuff when I was one oh yeah yeah What did he say he's singing talking about chemicals during wine and he made some mistakes right well I think there's a lot of misconceptions about winemaking commercial large-scale winemaking I've seen a lot of things happen in sell there's large scale sellers that are cutting corners are just a lot of things that they happen to do but there's this idea that there's all these things that we're adding to our to our wines right it gives you headaches and fuck you up yeah so you know in our vineyard we do have copper sprays and things that are kind of we're avoiding frost or avoiding bunch rot copper sprays yeah it's it's a long story but you know just it's organic stuff we're trying to do - this was actual copper I'm not sure if it's actual copper or not I would imagine it's know huh I don't know okay I don't know they answer that so but that's just yeah there's some things you're doing in the in the vineyard that are kind of like organic practices that are acceptable but one of the things when the fruit actually gets to the winery i'm inoculating it with a you know a packaged yeast so something it might be an isolated strain from Barolo or from Tuscany but other than that at the end of the process will add KMS and so2 solution to to stabilize the wine to keep it bottled so it's safe in the bottle but what does KMS stand for sulfur where we actually result we're adding sulfites to the wine but wine itself actually produces those byproducts we're just we're just escalating it to make sure that this wine can make it on a truck to New Jersey or to whatever and they blow off they go away so that's what I mean yeah it basically just kind of preserves it them and some places that are paranoid about where that wine is going and how long it's gonna be sitting in a truck and maybe it's not going to be refrigerated there be adding a little bit too much and there's some places that are actually adding you know other weird stuff you know enzymes and stuff into their wines and in the process but in my cellar it's basically it's the yeast holes it's the it's the yeast and at the end it's so2 we're not doing any other weird additives so the idea that there's like all these chemicals and all these extra things we're jamming into our wines is ridiculous so this is just a misconception I think so yeah I mean but are there any wine companies that do that yeah I'm sure yeah there's a lot of stuff people are adding you know they're adding what they call mega purple they're adding like tannins and they're adding color and what is oh so make it further adding like weird nutrients on this end and weirding you know weird nutrients on that end and some nitrogen on this end they're you know they're adding a lot of extra stuff in the process that you know I don't do because we're doing very small batches of things then they don't have to alert people of what they're putting in either I mean it's just wine you get a bottle of wine you assume it's just wine yeah I think that's changing I think the FDA is threatening to stick their nose into into wineries now which is a pain in the ass mmm you know they want to know where everything's coming from and going to and yeah really all the shit that's going on you're gonna do without government gonna fix the wine yeah we're going coming yeah hey Puscifer what do you think you're doing with your wines for the last 3,000 years they were adding husks back then really did they even know what husks were yeah so um so when you're when you're adding this stuff to the wine and you say that it burns off like you're adding sulfites or sulfates and sulfur so getting sulfur just as a preservative and it burns Oh is there an ideal if slows off I should say okay when you bottle a wine is there an ideal time after you bottle that wine where it should be consumed I mean you can bottle it the minute you can open up to the minute it's a bottle if you want to if you want to open it up right but there's your um where it liked is the like when we drank that wine from like 1924 whatever the fun was is that good or is that different I mean it's like that's al is a long conversation but uh you know wines in theory there's places that that just the natural structure of that place the the pH the acid balance is of those places and depending on how well or not well the winemaker got out of the way to make sure that that when that wine made it into bottle it was proper the the storage of it the the cork how that how that went there's so many so many so many variables but when you're talking about the track record of a particular site and a producer there are you know there are wines that you just expect if I'm gonna buy this Latour I'm gonna buy this fine Burgundy you expected that wine has been held to a standard for a long period of time like all you know throughout you know decades millennia they have been consistent so you expect that I should be able to lay this wine down for 50 years and it should be okay it'll be different in 50 years provided none of those other variables like somebody didn't pull it out and leave it on the counter and the Sun for a week and then put it back in the cellar and 50 years later you open it it's crap right yeah and that's a heater son itself it could be cold it could be something that goes to gets too cold and gets too dry the cork drives out at leaks that Cox agent gets in heat is your enemy cold is your enemy oxygen is your enemy so as long as it's treated correctly it could last a long time and it'll just change and be difficult evolve over time and it will dead there's definitely an arc to it there's like there's definitely like okay that that particular wine was ready to there's a peak that's the sugar drank it right then how do you know do you know from reading like articles or again it's it's you know it's some that's why I buy some guys buy a case or two cases of a wine that they know they're gonna like and they're trying them over time and they're figuring it out and then they'll have that wine and they'll go hey guys I just had the tenth bottle of wine from those 24 bottles and it's starting to go over the hill hmm so there's a little forum or somebody calling each other back and forth going hey I think this particular wine is is is has seen its best day and they'll get back on line and somebody will go no mine's fire you know they'll be arguments about that but generally speaking it's that communication of guys saying that's interesting so it requires like a community of knowledgeable people to communicate about it yeah I have a buddy of mine he's a fucking total why not he invited me to his birthday party and there was a wine-tasting birthday party and they were all sitting around like and they would judge the wine afterwards he said it's very oaky there's hints of tannin and I'm like what in the fuck or you guys take and one of them that they didn't like they're like this one's corked I think this one's corked I was like this one's my favorite yeah I really like this one you told me it's bad it's as bad like how's it bad like how do you know it's bad like it seems like it's corked what does that drive you crazy they're super easy yeah mmm that's a dress so there's like a level pretentiousness that's acceptable yeah again everybody wants to never bitch try to find their way in life and try to find what makes them better than or different than or separates them or elevates them somehow it's amazing his palate is incredible he's going to be able to tell when he tastes it and he hits some fat ass Orson Welles just sitting there yeah if you know after a couple glasses if that thinks not really corked I'm drinking it hmm yeah right especially after a couple glasses yeah in the olden days they used to drink wine because water would go bad right yeah the well the enough well still water sit around yeah still there's still water but also you know if you have in this situation where you have you know like New Orleans complete devastation of the water table there's no decomposing bodies everywhere and you can't drink the groundwater you can't trust what's coming out of your well you know fermented you know fermented juice is what you would drink if it's safe because it's gone through a fermentation process a process of purification just like vodka the water of life it's the water that doesn't freeze you can go through the tundra if you try to eat snow you're gonna freeze to death if you try to like you know melt the snow you're building if you do have a fire but the actual water of vodka doesn't freeze and you can actually survive you have to have water while you're walking through this frozen tundra and you get the benefit of being drunk all the time drunk as fuck in a snowbank yeah like Vikings in a big-ass leather sack full of wine they were always hammered yeah no wonder why they had such a ridiculous behavior yeah you're drunk all the time sure eating mushrooms and me Lincoln yeah Mead yeah that's wine or that's great it's made out of honey yeah yeah yeah honey wine beer yeah honey is a weird preservative right because it doesn't go bad ever yeah I like it yeah you could take things and honey you stuff them in honey and they just stay good they think that's one of the things that led to my iPhone 5 is it work good on honey what do you men still preserve doesn't look any different you still use an iPhone 5 you one of those guys yeah it's an iPhone 6 yeah I'm just kidding but you have a you have a port for the headphones in phone port is that we you stop changing yeah that's where we draw the line draw the line on the headphone port a lot of people do like that's where I draw the line but uh so Mead what like I'd read something where they were speculating that one of the conversions from mushroom culture to me God they think that we used to be like our the intoxicants were primarily psychedelic and then they went to alcohol some point in human history and that that might have coincided with people trying to preserve mushrooms in honey and that they produce some sort of a honey mushroom chemical reaction of the honey actually fermented yeah and then people started drinking Mead and then Mead culture changed the way people alcohol culture which is like our aggressive you know loose losing inhibitions wild culture is there any movement to bring back those leather wine sacks you know those one of those things called those things that the I went into Vikings had you know yeah carry them around those other sacks a bladder yeah the wine bladder any benefit to drinking looks good I think I need you to roll into Agostino wine bar with a fucking bladder and a fucking horned helmet right drink your ale from one of those big-ass bullhorn things do they I mean does anybody serve wine out of like a leather thing I would feel like that's like the next Mumford and Sons should be do what they do growlers so if you walk into a into a want a beer bar I think there allow you to bring in if it's measured out what that volume is and you can refill your growler with beer right I think some places do the same with wine the big the big issue is is labeling so like you know the TTB gets all weird in the liquor department gets all weird because like well the bottle has all the labeling on it that I need to make sure that your are you pregnant there's a warning on your about that so if you're just coming in and filling your growler with wine I think if the assumption is that at some point you you know violate the law yeah I don't know or not I don't know it seems kind of weird to me yeah I just fill up just let the guy fill up his thing have you ever thought about experimenting with like a leather bladder for your wine to see if it influences the taste we did one for not a leather won't be just like a plastic one for we do a wine garden what do you got there that's the that's the bladder Oh on the range yeah they rock on the range we did it at aftershock we had like a wine a caduceus Merkin wine booth we did one down in Florida for a couple of all and does it affect the taste at all being in that yeah I mean well that you're in the middle of a field with a bunch of shitty bands playing it's going to taste different that's just it's hot and you're annoyed so yeah it's gonna taste different drink it cuz you're annoyed in it right do you have recommended temperatures that your wine should be stored or served at yeah I mean just normal normal seller seller seller ring anyone it that'd be nice if you could put it like 50 degrees and you're in your wine cellar a good spot for it forty fifty or forty to forty five degrees what you want but you don't want to put in your fridge because it's gonna get too cold doing well yeah if it's if it's if you're gonna drink it fairly if you go to the store and you got a you're gonna get a bottle of wine you want to cram in the fridge for the day to open it up that night that's fine but if you store your wine on the fridge that's a little too cold I'm storing it I've done that before it's better than leaving it out you know on top of your fridge where it's gonna get baked so yeah it's kind of like way out you're so if your house is 70 degrees you shouldn't just leave it in your house you can't as long as it's gonna maintain 70 so when you go to a supermarket though and they have those like it's all sitting there isn't it yeah they're not doing anything about that are you buying wine at a supermarket I don't know where else for it or should I go a nice wine shop that's gonna so pretentious it's like going to a cigar bars dealing with those guys same thing you know I agree it's from Nicaragua smell the cigar well this producer uses a lot of natural fermentation and they you know they definitely do you know with it working like Bob a blob of dorks baseball card dorks the same person yeah they're just going after wine instead of baseball cards can I just had the fucking boy give me a Negra Modelo in a lime and a bag of chips good what are you a bag of lime and chips love lime little lime juice and the never know um you know bag of chips oh yeah and a Maduro like a dark cigar they're for the snack let's do this okay get yourself some chitchat Oh a nice what is that pork rinds okay ooh pork rinds Oh like I'm at a gas station a little bit a little bit of sour cream mmm a little bit of valentino hot sauce on that ooh you got cold you got heat he got crunch you got salt you got sweet from the cream now are you one of those guys that will not drink a red wine with fish I don't drink I don't yeah i'll i don't abide by those rules i've had red wines that go with all things and white wines it going rosary's ago with all things i'll try all of them but if the if if the experience isn't working right i'll shift gears but i won't be afraid of i won't i won't be afraid there i won't go with a set rule going in there used to be a hard fast rule right wasn't that kind of yeah in general I think it's more it's just work it's just more something to talk about at the grocery store and so it's like a fetish I'm having I'm having this for dinner what should I have hmm I think a red wine like a pairing good pair these some some restaurants have a pairing with each selection and very rarely do you have a white wine with a bloody steak I do I'll do it crazy you living on the edge though I'm on the edge right on the edge of the earth where it goes off dude we did three hours already it's already gone by alright no nuts yeah that's pretty crazy oh fuck is that happen got a workout in went over here did your stretchy things in the back there oh did you yeah that thing the the back thing is amazing yeah I didn't do that I didn't do the one with the weights I just did the one we hang upside down that one with the way I'll show it to you after we're done with us that thing's the shit everybody should have one of those just for back maintenance yeah it's goddamn epic it just looks like it had too much weight on it no it's not that heavy it seems like
