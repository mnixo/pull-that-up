the girag an experience you are you were on space for 166 days amazing huh that's insane it's it's when I sit on my dock and watch the Space Station go over it's really hard to rationalize because I know I was up there and I can remember all the details but to try and Link in life on earth with with seeing that spotlight go across the horizon it's it's still I haven't got sorted out of my head how to connect it is that the long as the person has ever been up there no we there was a Russian guy named Valeri Polyakov estate of 14 months straight 400 and whatever that is day's long time Wow yeah no I'm nowhere near the record that's an extinct 166 days is an incredible amount of time to be detached from gravity and floating around in space what what is the effect on your body a big effect short term huge your body doesn't have to lift the blood up to your head when you're weightless right so your whole cardiovascular system changes all the nice little mechanisms that squeeze the balloon that is your body to get the blood up to your head they stop work and your heart gets smaller you start losing your skeleton your balance system completely shuts down I mean it has no stimulus from gravity anymore so you become totally visually based so when you come home it's brutal building all those things back up again and most of them you feel I mean you lose the calluses on the bottom of your feet it's kind of disgusting because your your feet are like a snake up there but the bottom of your feet are shedding because you never use the bottom of your feet and you build up calluses on the top because you're always tucking your feet underneath things so when you come back you even have to grow the calluses back at the bottom of your feet and the thing that takes the longest is your skeleton I lost about 8% of the bone across my hips and but it's grown back and within about a year of landing all hopefully be back to normal one year it takes one year for your body to fully recover took about four months before I could run normally again where my body would get the blood out of my feet and pump it properly back up to my head about four months which is almost as long as I was up in this trip but yeah the bone takes the longest but it's it's automatic which is interesting my body got osteoporosis and it's reversing osteo rose's using some internal stimulus that we don't even understand so it makes a pretty good medical study for everybody 200 years ago it this so long ago when you think of like if you had to go back in time and live like people live 200 years ago it would suck a fat one it wouldn't even be a little fun everybody would die every time the flu comes into town all your best friends are dead dead you don't live you get an infection dead you just got to survive at that point 200 years later we're talking about 200 years from now where there's robots that you literally can't tell if it's a person or a robot right for sure right 100% and no wrinkles I think they're already here do you think the robot prostitutes will be the first market oh yeah probably right violence or sex how much how much blowback do you think they'll be with robot prostitutes if women you know what will women like draw a line in the sand that fucking a robot is a cheating thing so back to what you were saying so so something is ugly as like oh they would still get mad if we had sex with it yeah that's what I'm saying if he gets to like if it looks like a fake thing women probably would be like treated like a fleshlight right but as it gets closer and closer to a real person like if it looks like Robby the Robot from Lawson Space Ranger danger you could stick your dick in that nobody's gonna say anything what would they let you print out a face of her though like so if it looks just like your wife yeah but yeah that why would you want to come home or faces covered in seven inches of comms you never clean it you just keep shooting face she's like what do mean try to drown me is this like some passive-aggressive shit right or you're drowning me income or you're married to Burnett you come home and the robots blonde yeah and that's what she just freaks the work out you come home you put in blackface on your roll I think the problem that people have with being informed over being distracted is that it's incredibly frustrating and you feel helpless when you start reading all these stories about the stock market manipulations about the banks being bailed out and about bailouts where the fucking people that were involved in the bailout somehow or another warranted some crazy Commission they got some bonus of and the gut and then the president says gonna limit to a half a million dollars like a fucking a half a million dollars a lot of money man what do you mean you're limiting it to a half didn't we just give them a ton of money you feel helpless when you read about this shit over and over and over again when you watch documentaries on fracking when you you know you read stories in the news about how how poorly veterans are being taken care of when they come back from war and there's so many different things that you read what it doesn't make sense I know but when you look at all of these news stories there's always one underlying issue in every news story it's kind of amazing and it always goes back to who is funding these politicians right if you get the money out of politics that virus if you destroy that virus things will change quickly because our representatives will be forced to pay attention to the American people the people that are voting for them as opposed to the people who are paying them you know if you get rid of that type of bribery that we're dealing with right now the entire system needs to be changed unquestionably but how does that ever happen I mean it doesn't mean we have to like get them to change it themselves as well how else is it going to get changed here's the thing Congress is obviously very corrupt so Congress dare you this is Congress of America they're obviously very much bought by corporations and as a result it's really difficult for them to propose any real change but when it comes to the state level when it comes to state legislators it's a little different so we actually managed to get a state representative from Texas to propose a resolution for a constitutional convention it goes back to what I was saying earlier about Wolfpack and if we get you know state state representatives from all the states to agree to this constitutional convention then we can actually have this constitutional amendment to get money out of politics it's possible we just need to inform people about it wolf dash pack.com what is the mainstream explanation for human sacrifice like what what do they believe started off well that it's that it's a feeding of psychic energy to supernatural beings that's what human sacrifice is about that you take the psychic energy of the individual you're going to kill you kill them take their psychic energy and feed it to these vampire like creatures that are lying in the beyond that that thrive on human misery and pain and you know who are we to say that such things do not exist we don't understand the nature of reality I don't go with you on that but I do in a way I don't believe in demons but I do I think it's undeniable that there have been massive groups of people that have participated in horrific things so what is that is not demonic I believe it's I believe it's demonic I can't prove it I can't prove that that's the case I just think we should stay open to that possibility that the nature of reality is so complex and so multi-layered that there may be much more going on than we think and that if we just if we just confine our explanations of things to purely economic in material terms we may be missing part of the picture and that when the ancients spoke of angels and demons to use words I'm not saying that I believe in angels or demons as such but when they spoke of light and light and dark forces negative and positive forces playing on that on the human race maybe they had something going maybe there was something to that well I always consider the fact that human beings have this incredibly broad spectrum of possibility it's incredibly broad spectrum of behavior and personality of circumstance of genetics and that there's this yin and yang of life there's this pull and push of life and that the extreme ends of it are good and evil good and evil you and and it's may not be a demon but it might as well be a demon if you're marching 80,000 people off the side of a pyramid and cutting their heart out with a fucking stone tool yeah that's demonic it might as well be might as well be a demon yeah and and and that is that is worth considering and the question is what is you know what is going on here I have a very dear friend called James Tiburon who refers to this world that we live in as a university of duality that we have that we have lessons to learn from Jew ality maybe duality is not the whole thing maybe there is an overarching unity and oneness in all things but right now here in this incarnation on planet Earth we have to learn from duality and the thing about duality is human beings can choose we can always choose even in the most straightened and difficult circumstances we can always choose for the light rather than the darkness we can always choose for good rather than evil we don't have to take that act that causes pain and suffering to another human being we never have to do that we can always choose not to the alarming thing is that people often will choose the act that causes pain and suffering to others and we are defined by our choices and this is where we need to grow up as a species and start to choose start to choose the light
