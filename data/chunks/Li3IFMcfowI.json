the girag and experience you were on Fox News yeah once upon a time I made it in there did it smell like sulfur it's not like Souls why are the girls that work there so fucking hot because they know the higher people burn that's insane they're way too hot it's not fair because men will agree with them just to hope that they will say yeah high five you'll change your whole philosophy and there's you can find clips on YouTube where people just put together every time they like open their legs during the half various segments praise the Lord they're too hot it's unfair that's like hypnosis you know some of those what's that woman's Megan what's her name the really angry when I get in Cali she's so fucking the hearts were there goes where she show me some megan kelly this is uh this is him this is really cool play this because this is how I found out about Lee but back it up so I'm sure you guys can have a lot more jokes for the rest of the campaign here Wow just keep what you can I can I just ask a questions yeah sure what what is Fox News it's just a parade of propaganda and then it's just add it's just a festival of ignorance what wait a million people are dead in Iraq come on this is ridiculous what's the point of this this is insane your people at home go outside go go finish me well love your fake blue you know all right all the news you can at Fox News all right thanks is the best what's there sorry what's the best part we're also dings didn't pull out Captain Kirk this morning because it's Saturday morning we'll have some fun Greg you've done the cushiest job in the world yeah look who just uh beamed aboard right now the ladies from the Starship Enterprise hello well oh I just wrote a new book on Captain Kirk and the way he was able to woo beautiful women like this coming up it's a book about Captain Kirk getting laid but come on the fictional character Captain Kirk to by the way yeah not even William Shaq no no it's a law book I was in the green room with then I could not figure out why there were these women there I had no idea how about that you just it was almost like it was scripted because you said that and they showed you was the most inane stupid piece of shit I didn't even know that was coming up next oh my god it was perfect you couldn't have been what if they went to some serious news and fucked you yeah he wanted to you could see in his face as he read the teleprompter he was like all right we're gonna get out of this and go to ah shit indie rock it's like completely proved your point like right away I come on Mare how did Kirk get laid he just gave written wrote that he got laid the writers made him get laid he's not a real guy jesus fucking christ this is an alien's there's two wars going on the fucking entire banking system had to be bailed out by taxpayers money he was running late they just wanted to see what a human cock was like that's how he got laid do you think they have like a bunch of shit that they will throw out there like beach balls to distract and they get like they get it from the CIA every week there's a Star Trek check they just have to send it to like this Emily we want you to talk about this week let's just just zap the American mind there's a pop really since yeah yeah no no no no no you know I mean I don't believe that it is I don't believe I think I tend to think that it's more incompetence than it is conspiracy I think it's ratings they don't actually care about the news they only care about ratings they don't care about the news but I think in general like even the the most of what we think of as being this big gigantic conspiracy with our government and the media is more incompetence and whorish behavior than anything just their prostitutes yeah it prostituted themselves out because that's where they got the good assignments they got the good places they got the big ratings I mean you don't get to that point you don't get to that job unless you've proved yourself a faithful foot soldier to whatever their message is generally you know they're not you're not gonna get hired on there yeah and even guys that used to be kind of like rebels like Geraldo era rather Rivera was kind of a rebel at one point dan yeah you know he was the guy that had Dick Gregory on TV and showed the Zapruder film for the first time wasn't he also the guy got a fist fight at a KKK rally I think i'ma show up someone hit him in the head with a chair they might not even been trying to hit him it was just a melee and I think a chair went flying he guy's nose broken and he was fucked but he was so excited so excited he had an actual cut at his face I'm a tough guy Lee was he was supposed to box Frank Stallone or something crazy like that too I think a long time ago oh my god they might have actually done it I don't know I'm pretty sure but he's a wild dude at least he was a while dude you know and now he's just like Fox News puppet it's weird when you see the ones that actually stick to their guns they don't last long I mean qianqiu lasted two months at MSNBC before he went before he needed to leave amber lion is another one that left because her Bahrain story actually mention Bahrain CNN she brought it back to them and said this is what's going on Bahrain but they were doing ads talking about how great Bahrain was and they wouldn't play our segment yeah yeah she's been on the podcast before and she explained it all to us since it's so hard to believe that what we considered to be like a signing revered institution of news like CNN has just a bullshit propaganda wing that they that they're capable of that kind of behavior if she's telling the truth I don't know I wasn't there I assume she is she seems very honest I don't know anybody else aside on the other side I don't know what the fuck's really going on so I probably shouldn't comment on what CNN did or didn't do but I know for a fact they're not reporting a lot of shit that's going on I'm never putting a lot of shit and I feel like all these networks the mainstream media it's a very small box of accepted thought that is allowed on them it's not it's not they're not going to go either very far today to either side or outside that boxes no use it's not really the news and that's one of the more interesting things about the internet is because the internet now there's all these sources that are like more real news like they're telling you about shit that's going on that you might not have known so we getting on Fox News girls why they so far those girls are so goddamn hot like I don't want to marry them I don't wanna have relationships with them but if I was a single man I would be very attracted to those angry bitches or the Weathermen in LA I just think they're so they're so like aggressive I don't know if they're so strong like they're so Stern in their opinions yeah most of them are not dumb there's nothing to it dumb no there's something sexy about those mean bitches yeah just because I'm a glutton for punishment but if you um like when you're on that show like what what is it like when you're in that studio does it feel weird do you feel like well that's the thing is like all of them just seem like they're doing their job I mean yeah they work for the evil empire but they don't they're just like whatever gets him through the day oh I need to say this thing and this thing and then we know we wrapped for the day like so I had to remind myself why it was important for me to do that I like reread an article about a million people died in Iraq I mean this was this was several years back and and you know because you don't want to fuck up the show like yeah I felt like I needed to do it I only wanted to be on there once I was like if they were having me on it's gonna be a one-time thing this is it dude it was if you were like a publicity whore and I know you're not but that would be an awesome move I mean it works out great I never thought it was 7:00 a.m. on a Saturday I truly thought the only people and this is four or five years ago we're not everything on the news went online right I truly thought the only people seeing it would fox news fans at 7:00 a.m. on a Saturday and instead it went up online and viral and all that shit if you got something relevant to say the internet will catch it yeah they'll find it and they'll put it out there to go back to that girl like standing sitting there with their legs open this is insane I just want to point something out of how we are so weird like as a culture that this is a part of like normal everyday office life like we got to make some decisions here like okay look at this woman she's showing everything but her vagina I mean her knee is just strategically blocking her labia her legs are wide open and she's hot as fuck now here's the thing if you put the chyron right in front of the vagina then everybody would know the news exactly we'd be a very informed country and women would get angry if you knew the news oh you were looking at a vagina and you read the fucking news huh like she look it's just weird that they get to dress like that like she's completely wearing cum fuck-me pumps back that up again let's dissect this look at her like her shoes those are like I want to go out and get sex shoes there's a not comfortable by any stretch of the imagination they show most of your foot her almost her entire legs are exposed you imagine if a guy was sitting there like that you know how bizarre that would be if there was a show where a guy was sitting there in a tiny tiny kilt and you know that you could bear if it moves his left knee an inch to the right you're gonna see his cock for sure and this and they also have like an ejection button that slings them into the stratosphere once they hit 35 the hidden ager hit an age limit they disappear aw poor girls that's fixed she had some kind of irritation down there so well I think Sarah Palin brought the dumb milf back so ha ha ha ha maybe maybe you'll move in that direction but I don't think she actually brought it back she brought it back for a little bit but now people oh my god you say too much crazy see GILF GILF you're forgetting the grin right right right she's a GILF you don't want to say that duckies that'll fuck with your dick that's creepy yeah milf is okay but GILF not so much it's just weird that we have these odd standards of sexual attire in the workplace and not just in the workplace but on television like on television promoting this too strange propaganda machine and just really hot girls with their vaginas hanging out yes explosions and hot girls okay I can't pay attention whatever the fuck she's saying where she's your thigh oh my god see if I see that girl I go wow I wish she liked me you know especially if you're lonely and you know you're not married or anything do that whatever is like 12 times her size yeah it's Rob Ford's fat brother and what other shows has that cameraman it from the ground up skirt it is Mexico it's totally an obscure they're panning from the vagina up it's off-center just slightly he's trying to show off his too though you gotta give him credit he's well you know he's gotta go to war you know you gotta get a respect I just he doesn't give a foot look look the only way I'm gonna get this one is if I let her know I don't give a fuck here's my gut I'm gonna trying to cover myself up I'm staying an extra straight I'm spreading my legs wide look at that package she's going for the don't give a fuck yeah points he's like I might be a fat fuck but I'll fuck his shit out of you dirty bitch I'm fat because I like to live the good life that's what he's saying I like how there's playlists who's that one all the different ones who's that one the one that you just that's a fox went to the red end yeah it's great that one the blonde that was on screen I know who she is that's the one she's been on these things before they're all hot though they're beautiful it's weird but it's just such a dirty trick the eye I'm not especially like if you're married and you know we when you're trying to be monogamous you're going to look at sex in a different way because you look at like a girl that's like super super hot and you know I could never get that if you're single you can have your delusional you'd be like man if I just ran into her at the right places time maybe this could happen so it's a different thing so it's the there's a wistful almost romantic way you look at the Fox News girls if you're married I'm honest on the same note it's like when I went out when a hot celebrity you like gets divorced there's something inside the most looser of guys it's like now I got a shot you know like Angelina Jolie gets divorced and people like okay they think all I gotta do is to be there I'm just there guys are so fucking delusional they feel like all they gotta do is be at the right place the right time you know maybe she goes to the car shop because her wipers broke and she wants try to fix it herself and you know I get to impress her by my knowledge of windshield wipers and she realizes it I'm just a regular guy and sometimes girls Jesus Christ look at this she actually pulled her shirt up look BAM like Oh Jer you pull it up how dare you you dirty bitch oh my God look how she sits it should like go perfect posture it's kind of like going back to when you were like really young looking at like like JC Penney's lingerie catalogs like way more intense yeah and you wonder why people who watch Fox News idiots I mean not that a lot of network time but you know they did that study that people that watch Fox News know less about what's happening the world that people watching no news at all I believe that I love that that make sense you know you're gonna find out about Captain Kirk's love life so these are two regular guys ABC look how ABC has regular girls ABC is more probably geared towards women that don't want to be threatened the drugs in the background you never seen this video no yeah is he naked nice hammered in his shorts well Christine they are the whole neighborhood knows the boy they jumped every fucking second-story window fell that's amazing oh my god that's funny yeah if you leave the fucking camera on long enough people catch the craziest shit ever did you see any other like this the snowstorm drugged his son he got jacked yes yeah I dare say yeah the snowstorms all throughout the the country they've been getting these nutty snow and ice storms yeah what is that man it's it should be not as unfair I mean I don't want to say that pretty girl shouldn't be able to get a job they certainly should but it shouldn't be exclusively pretty girls telling you about important shit we're too weak we're not paying attention to the message no no no but that's thing if you see an ugly girl on the news you're like that girl knows her shit all right she fought her way to the top this there's something about um like a like what I said like those Fox News women that like the one you were talking about before the show started who argued with someone about Santa Claus being white megyn kelly apparently is said very authoritative Lee that Santa Claus is white she's very authoritative always a lot of those gals are but there's something like for beta men especially for men they're weak and beaten down by life the ultimate fantasy is that this woman accepts you the ultimate fantasy is that she's impressed by you an exception she's so hard-ass she's so obviously beautiful but also so hard-ass that there's this there's this you know when she's around you you want to like mock Obamacare you want to start making fun of it like you're right specific jokes just too many roles yeah just get in is to get in there just again and spill talk to her yeah Santa's white you're goddamn right II know she's white VRC show me one picture with Santa black that wasn't drawn by a black guy
