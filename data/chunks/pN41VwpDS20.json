five four three two one funk does that sound that and everybody knows sunk like if you play that sound people know that's an arrow right yeah think it may be throwing knife okay but you know what isn't it dang right we do dang right that's it that's an Iowa boy right there that's the Midwest comin at ya sometimes I hear you on your podcast and I'm like man he is so Midwest hilarious sorry about that don't apologize it's awesome I'm actually more of a half-breed I'm a little bit of South right yeah yeah I was a redneck for a while and then then became a Yankee my the people up north don't give it they don't give a shit what people think north or south but this the people from the south my family they're like you're part Yankee now yeah and that weird fatal weird they lost that's why the Civil War thing you imagine I mean we are where several generations removed but imagine growing up in like the late 1800s when it just happened and you dealing with Yankee see my spellin law murders right people killed northerners and northerners killed southerners and much been a lot of that it was ruthless I'm sure oh how that fuck did that happen that is a crazy time you think about the the history of this country that just 200 years ago we were in you know less we're in the middle of a bitter war from the north versus the South Americans fighting Americans to the death big fields full of dead people my dad was at one of the fields I forget which field it was um but he said you know it's one of those memorial places in the south and he said the feeling or something yeah you know what it was Gettysburg and he said you feel it he's like you feel sadness then yeah so he gets out I know it sounds crazy and he was saying I don't even believe in that stuff but you feel it like you're there you're like oh yeah we've been in a few memorials a few memorials and a few big you know like special like military cemeteries oh you just you know another one I felt it like exactly what you're saying I went to a historic part of Custer where they lost the battle and I walk the whole Hill and everything you can feel it there what is that do you think there's like memory in places hell yeah there is yeah it probably is right I think there is it's probably an instinctive reason why people don't want to live in a house where someone was murdered yeah I don't want to live there I don't want to live there okay like there's a house that JonBenet Ramsay was killed in in Colorado they can't sell that fucking house dude I lived there nine years ago eight years ago somewhere over there nine years ago and they were selling it then they still can't sell it it's a beautiful house it's in a really nice neighborhood can't sell it they haven't changed the name of the street they changed the name of the street still can't sell it I'm not kidding they just can't sell it has it does it have like historical everybody's terrible sightings and stuff was it just killing just the killing and the the hold the darkness all behind it I mean that was one just was it wasn't just a little girl died but there's all this darkness she was sexually active there was something going like someone was probably molesting her someone in the family or someone else who knows they think some of the family might have killed her they don't know who it was it's never been solved no one's ever been tried it's a dark yeah I'm not moving there fuck that they can keep that I think I should level that thing to the ground and maybe even do something with the ground underneath it scoop all that shit out put some new dirt and yeah I'm not kidding I'm not kidding like that might be the only way who are you gonna throw that mojo on though you got to put that turf you got to put that dirt somewhere yeah who's worthy of taking it right where would you put that dirt you have to exercise it you'd have to build like the most awesome Park for kids like you'd have to turn that house into something you're positive I don't want to do anything for kids there for sure that would be bad taste but you could always take that big scoop and kind of put it in a freak party desert or something where people like ghosts and crap can go out there and play in it or camp on it everybody likes little kid ghosts you want like some old man ghosts can tell you secrets you think you've ever seen a ghost no I do not have you ever experienced something that was like super creepy do you know what a couple of my friends at the Comedy Store have claimed to have seen ghosts and claimed to have seen things and I with many of my friends that work there and comics and stuff we've gone upstairs to the belly room in the dark just freaked ourselves out stoned out of her mind I feel it we gotta go are you going to the main room at night like give me a hug hold me ahh I'm scared it's a it's a weird place man people for sure have been murdered there it was a Bugsy Siegel's nightclub in the nineteen what wasn't authorities or 40s or some shit it was Syros nightclub yeah there's definitely some mojo there yeah for sure how do we get going down the path of death go to my Instagram John Dudley is riding the werewolf we were trying to figure out well the werewolf Patrick Magee made that werewolf and it comes in two paid pieces you slide out and well Patrick McGee has a new movie out I should pump his new movie out if you're into there it is oh my god it's got 5,000 likes already I put it in two minutes ago that's an awesome picture but uh Pat McGee the guy who made that just made a movie a Bigfoot movie it's called a primal scream I think isn't what it's called it just came out is it a legit one or like a horror movie oh yeah it's a monster okay killing people I'll watch the jacking people in the woods I'll watch that yeah I got good reviews I hope it's good I love me a good Bigfoot movie and there's not a whole lot of them I think we would've saw a Bigfoot a long time ago there yeah for sure I think but but what would you do if you actually ran across one double lung would you potat to take the penalty double lung prove a point no I would hope I'd have my camera on me but then people would call me a fucking liar that would be a bummer if you really saw a Bigfoot you're like god damn he's real never everyone's gonna think I'm crazy because everybody that I know that believes in Bigfoot I'm all-in aren't everybody know that you got a shark yeah even if you got a picture you're done yeah then you're gonna then all the good faith that you've built up by being honest all these years fuck that guy he's full of shit he faked a Bigfoot sighting man yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't shoot it definitely not but I think if it was real I really do believe that if it was real this is the this is the the trailer for OMA C and Pat McGee did this with all special effects like suits and shit and an actual makeup and prosthetics and all the stuff that they used in the old movies like he doesn't believe in that CGI shit I think he's got a point at CGI shit it's just - it takes away from it does I mean you look back at some of the movies that scared the you know scared the hell out of you when you're a kid and you watch them now and you're like what man did they it just seems so much more real but if you watch something to where you know it's fake it's you almost can't picture the fact that it's flesh and blood right and you need you don't feel it like this some of those transformer type movies they're smashing buildings you like I know this isn't happening just you don't feel it it doesn't feel like a real explosion doesn't feel like a real robot just feels like horseshit yeah but the dinobots pretty they're pretty dope what's a Dinobot it's a dinosaur version is that one of the Transformers yeah your yours well-schooled Gobots and transformers were the bomb and when I was a kid that in Cabbage Patch Kids so isn't it crazy that that became that transformers became huge hit movies it was a dumb toy right yep was it originally a toy yeah transformers they were cool I should say dumb toy if everyone's a collector they're freaking out dumb to me how about that yeah go BOTS and transformers they were I mean up before that you had you know army men muscle men you remember those those little pink rubber muscle men they are all freaking Jack do you know what I remember remember Stretch Armstrong yeah the home part yeah they never made a movie out of him did they my boy what's funny is they didn't have they did have some of that stuff there's a hard little muscle that there's something that looks really gay about that they're all pink they're all pink and those were pretty cool just on that just a roundabout guess how many dudes have stuffed those up their ass oh my god hundreds or thousands I'd say thousands yes all right thousands of people have had those in their eyes we're going down that road already why not if you just if we could pull up we could pull back you think about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles right did not start off as a was that a comic book was a comic that was a comic yeah it wasn't a toy first this my boy he really got into I don't know what it was but he had this Peter Pan doll and I think because he didn't have a brother or sister he would beat the shit out of this Peter Pan doll and if he wouldn't do it when everyone was there but you know as adults you kind of you know you end up coming around the corner see if they're okay or whatever maybe we're downstairs for a while and I come up there and I mean he's just got his back to the door just freaking power dropping Peter Pan just kicking this thing in the face punching it I mean Karen and I just laugh out or like he doesn't do it with anyone else but for whatever reason Peter Pan is just his little brother and he just kicks the shit out of that sucker Peter Pan's bitch what about Robin Hood it was a Robin Hood toys ever did ever kids ever get a Robin Hood toy they made a Disney movie I would some share it got around no but that was because of the story right Robin Hood the Disney movie was all because the original Robin like physical like yeah were they popular I don't think yeah I don't think so no maybe when that Kevin Costner movie came out they sold a few but I bet they didn't that's a lot maybe a few I forgot that was a movie how bad was Kevin Costner's form in that movie was it okay would you watch it and go who like when I see bad karate movies I might get the fucker yeah I don't know Elvis doing karate I watched I sent you a text I'm like I watched that so long Kevin Costner and Christian Slater for like to check out feather the feathering on the back of his hair yeah everyone the duck feather was like oh yeah kind of the style yeah yeah the feathering the hair and somehow or another he got his hair feathered wise in the fucking forest Nottingham with perfect haircut you got a suit look at that come on man get a super cuts right down the street the fuck did you get that haircut son she see that haircut I got the others look how they made arrowheads is that real how they did it yeah it looks like he's pouring a full metal one wow that's dope yeah they would melt it down and pour it in a cast it looks like one thing out like a Rocky Mountain cutthroat or something look at this showing them making the arrows in the bows and shit yep Wow that's right there he goes Drive huh how did they possibly know did they use scales to figure out how much the arrows weight back that was the scale no that fucking guy on the right is killing me that's about how everyone cheat with that equipment nowadays Morgan Freeman is beyond the wormhole this is hilarious this is so dumb I'm a Kevin Costner fan don't get me wrong I'm not a hater but damn Kevin Costner has been in some stinkers oh now they're getting better look oh yeah they learn I'm head coaching it is bad oh I just split another one is it Wow look at his skills see people don't understand splitting an arrow is fucking stupid it's costly it's it's not wise a skill well at least there was no CGI in this for sure I mean when I licked the feather before he's fired is he trying to curve it around it I don't know what he's doing why is he looking at he's gonna cut the string I'll you this yeah oh the drama is killing me this is a serious thing I wasn't sure if it was gonna hit the drama is killing me slow-ass arrow right yeah thank you how much any seconds I don't know think if you shot that an Access dear thanks to the other Island I've never seen anything like those things John and I hunted axis deer in Hawaii where they were brought over I was reading as a like a gift to the king in the 1800s most of that today actually oh did you yeah that's funny I was reading it I'm pretty sure I knew it already but I think that's exact where I was reading it yeah but they I've never seen anything move as fast as those things look you could shoot at one that's 40 yards away and by the time the arrow gets there it's nowhere near it it's like cheong yeah you need to load those fast twitch muscles in a UFC fighter of today just be concussion City it'd be crazy I've never just I've never seen an animal react to something so quick but it makes sense that they evolved around tigers tigers and leopards fucking shit roll the dice imagine being Tiger and leopard preferred food and that's the other thing about access deer they are delicious yeah they're like one of the most delicious animals on the planet and obviously Tigers must know this oh I bet they have to know it yeah I mean there has to be a correlation between something that's extra fast and extra delicious I really think there is well denomination's mmm not really right because like I don't know eat a hummingbird part tastes like shit I think a lot of it's their diet how much they're actually having to move around - yeah I think things that are running a lot like full speed it seems like the meat maybe isn't as tender but it's hard to say that's true well what I found is that Chad Ward method the your friend whisky bent BBQ mm-hmm he's changed the way I cook meat I do that here now and I use a meat thermometer always the only time I don't is when I i will saute backstraps slices or steak slices in a frying pan like a cast-iron grill I'll put some butter and some garlic salt and some cracked pepper and I'll just cook them pretty quick on a really hot skillet I like cooking like that too yeah but when I cook like a roast or something like that or a thick piece of meat I always use Chad's method yeah it's the way to go get it get the internal temperature I get it to around 120 and then I take it out and just sear the outside in the frying pan and let it sit for 10 minutes and oh one thing that a lot of people don't realize too when it comes to cooking a really good roast or steak or anything is I love having those soft Yeti bags or the smaller cooler mm-hmm and I'll take the stuff and actually you know kind of wrap it up just slightly in foil or butcher paper and then put it in the cooler and let it actually stage in there and you know and just stage in that moisture while I'm doing my vegetables because the things about 20 minutes to do vegetables and then take it out right at the very end to do that reverse here normally when I put it in there it gives me time to get you know a cast-iron pan hot enough with the butter to do a reverse sear mm-hmm so it's like really good for timing and it it really helps break down that that protein a little bit and it just makes it that much more tender that's interesting because I was doing that for a while but I was doing it after I did the sear I was I was taking it right from the grill and then I was searing it like I'd have the pan ready I'd see it right off the grill and then I'd wrap it in foil and put it in the Yeti but then you don't get kind of that Chris penis of the sear which he liked right because it stays moist yeah yeah stage it first start your veg and then like you know probably two minutes before you feel like you're gonna pull your vegetables off just get that butter going in the cast-iron pan and then do your reverse here you know you can do one side and then as soon as you flip it pull your veggies off the grill and you're literally you can go right back to the you know that one side your reverse sear and take it off and you're serving hot everything's new you know well that's one thing that I really give credit to Steve Rinella Steve Rinella really got me interested in wild game cooking and then Hank Shaw who he had on his TV show who's a brilliant chef and Gacy got a couple of books out one of them was buck buck moose I think I had it sitting here for a while till we moved everything off this table this table gets so cluttered I'm always trying everybody's always giving me books sitting here just got one I was just stacking up and I've been meaning there's book moves recipes and techniques for cooking deer elk and moose by Hank Shaw it's awesome it's really good I think that his books really good too he's got two of them hunting and cooking wild game I feel so inferior to those guys when it comes to cooking oh yeah I almost like the fact that that people really like my cooking or at least the pictures and what I make people are really into it because if they knew that my knowledge of cooking wild game is so limited it's it should be hope for anybody to be able to cook that easy because I'm not those guys right I mean I think if you know I would love to do that but I'm as simple as it gets when it comes to to grill and stuff yeah but I'm telling you there's an art to that simplicity like just you describing your method for you know like letting it stage and then searing it and what we learn from Chad when we cook that wild pig yeah that was amazing that was so good and I think there's there's something amazing in that simplicity because a lot of people fuck that simplicity up like that simplicity is a real common one to screw up people just overdo it or overcook it or something goes wrong but um Rinella really turned me on to all the various really fascinating dishes and he had several episodes of his TV show meat-eater that are just dedicated to cooking and I don't there's not a lot of hunting shows that ever have that it's always just about hunting and then the shot of the animal getting shot and then everybody smiling and high-five and that's it roll credits well that's pretty much yeah 60 70 % of all those hunting shows and his really stands out because it's like hey this guy's of real chef I mean as an amateur chef but he's a real chef he knows a lot about cooking and he does these delicious meals and they're intricated like he makes his really cool elk meatloaf was really good I've never done anything with Steve we've we've passed we've actually been within the same group of friends talking at times but we've never actually done something where we had to have a communication just the two of us but he's a fascinating dude very very smart girl I would love to actually I talked with Remy and I told Remy I said I would love to do just a weekend getaway where we just go back country and all you teach you know just I want to just follow Remy and see some of his you know just as natural like camping and survival type skills and then actually do and on the mounting coaching thing with Remy we were talking about doing a show where I literally retrain his way of shooting while he's retraining my way of backcountry hunting and literally he's doing his element I'm doing mine and we're able to to just do it the middle of nowhere that sounds cool yeah it would be pretty fun well I'm really fascinated by what Remy does and Tim Barnett and a bunch of those guys that have really taken up solo back hunt back country hunting where they backpack in and they'll go in 20 miles yeah backpack I mean obviously my favorite stories Adam green tree that fucking crazy bastard our good friend Adam went all the way deep into the mountains of Colorado and then again went out for a bit and went to Idaho right yep and that's when he had all the grizzly encounters but 28 days just living out of a backpack and putting his camp on its back most of the nights just carrying it around and just living literally off your back and there's an art to that and Remmy doesn't just do that but he also solo films everything which is incredible well that's what well I don't solo backcountry hunt but I definitely have really most of my TV show experience has all been from self filming I mean I've been doing 20-something years a lot of what you saw for me was all self filmed which a lot of people don't appreciate how tough that really is until I mean it is hard it's hard enough to to hunt and be successful but to film it is like a whole new yeah just to bring the cameras around with you and like with brimmy like if you watch the show solo hunter or Tim Burnett the other guy that's on each other always holding a tripod running up a hill while they're also holding a bow and setting it up and putting the camera in place and then trying to draw back and trying to get the and move the camera because the deers move in like GoPros helped a lot I'm just fascinated by the people that choose to go deep into the woods and live by themselves and do it for long long periods of time because it's it's it's a very interesting and solitary pursuit like when you're out there there's no TV there's no phones there's just you you only a backpack and a little tent maybe a bivy you're sleeping under the stars and then you get up in the morning and do it all over again and some of these guys do it for like 20 30 days at a time it's amazing it's hard for me to I don't actually like to post I don't even if I'm out camping on a hunt I actually don't post when I'm doing that just because of those guys out of respect for those guys it's who really really really do that I mean honestly I I understand what they're doing and I don't you know it's no different than you know there's there's people that post photos shooting archery when when it when I look back and see how long they've really done it you know they they build up or persona but there's also guys there's guys that have done twice as long as me but there's guys like me that have done you know possibly millions of arrows so it's it's hard to to see people like make pretend to be there right and I feel like I'm that guy if I if I post a picture of of me out in the backcountry in a bivy it's not the same as seeing Adam post a picture in a bivy or Remmy or Rinella we should explain a bivy - people don't know what it was it's like a combination tent sleeping bag yep yeah it means like yeah you can stuff it in your bag go out and you're more or less hunting just lay it on sleep you got some little bit of cover yeah sometimes people bring pads sometimes the hard hard hard core dudes don't even bring pads there you go that guys shooting out make up let's wake up and oh I hear an elk waken Baken breakfast is served yeah well that's crazy he's all got camo on the bivi too can you appreciate that though oh yeah I feel that way it's not just in the hunting world it's like that with a lot of things but you know why if I have trouble posts and pictures working out I know it's mean yeah like I'll I make sure I make sure people that are following me and trying to maybe be motivated by what my daily routine is I like them to see that I'm going and things like that but to actually post that I'm doing it because I do it to stay healthy it's not my life right and archery is my life so that's why sometimes it gets hard for me when people are pretending to do that or you know and I guess I don't have a problem with people doing it but I don't want to want them to do it but yeah I don't want to be enthusiastic about it but I know what you're saying yeah I just I'm trying to show respect for the people that are literally putting in the grind for those specific things the same as what I have done with my life for archery that's all I'm saying I know exactly saying it's like well I don't know I have a different attitude about that with stand-up comedy those I really really like when new people get into stand-up comedy that's contrary to like a lot of professionals feel like I was talking to a friend of mine the other day she's very funny and she was telling me that her uncle was thinking about getting into comedy and she was like oh oh god no you know but when people ask me like hey man I'm thinking about doing comedy I'm like you could do it yeah anybody could do it just figure it out it's like everything else it's like jujitsu or martial arts like fit fill in the blank it's anything else it's like music you learn the chords you figure out how to play you can do it you might not be able to do it mm-hm but that might be on you yeah I mean like whether or not like I think if you're a rational person and he thinks and you like comedy and you people laugh at you like you say funny shit sometimes you could be a stand-up will you will you do it I don't know people think it's a lot easier than it is they don't really know they don't see there's no way you could there's no I mean you think about all the hours all the time all the different sets but I like it when people get into it so if some new kid has only been doing comedy for three weeks throws a bunch of pictures on his Instagram page about going to an open mic day and I'm happy like go get it kid you know I mean especially when it comes to art form there's kind of a line there because when it comes to competition I'm very very active in getting people involved with trying to compete because I always felt like even as a coach when I helped people that were maybe not up to the rank that I was I felt like once I felt the pressure of them pushing on my heels it always elevated my game oh for sure and I've got friends that I've got friends that are with in different fields that I'm in and they actually have came to me and said hey we want to show you exactly how we're doing this and in a way I'm a competitor because I'm in the outdoor business but there's been a few times where some of my friends have said the reason we're telling you exactly how we do it is because we know that you're gonna do it different but maybe a little bit better and some of them have said we're stale right now we know we're stale we need to push and we need someone to like push past us so that will our competitive drive all will push through well you know what you're in the outdoor business but I'm gonna steal a page from my friend Sturgill book not a real book but what he said the other day he's like he goes I'm not really in the music business I'm in the Sturgill Simpson business and I was like damn that's right he's right cuz I'm not in show business yep I'm in the Joe Rogan business a hundred percent like I mean I'm in show business in terms of like I guess I work for the UFC that's show business I show of the Comedy Store that's show business but that's where that's my gym yeah that's where I'm practicing to being the Joe Rogan business and you're in the John Dudley business you know I mean what I was saying before I wanted to let you continue to thought but what I wanted to say was do you feel that way because you're a legit guy because like what you've done like a lot of people don't realize there's a lot of people in the archery world and there's a lot of people in the bow hunting world to talk about bow hunting and they they're really into archery but your background as a competitive Archer is just insane I mean you really like most people don't even know like you really did it all over the world I mean you compete an internationally you flew millions of miles I mean that you did the whole deal and it it's something that you because of the factors that you know you put so much effort in so much hard work into it and you're solidified as completely 100% legit you're very sensitive to things that you're not legit in so that's why you're a very authentic person like when you're thinking about like all the running like when I post pictures of running I often think again I'm running but I don't even have a real job cam Haynes is out there right at 25 miles a day that fucking crazy asshole and he's one of my best friends it's like I can't really you can't really think that I'm really run I mean I know I'm doing it but it's bitch-ass running it's I didn't want to use that example but an example that is the perfect example because yeah I don't post pictures of me yesterday I actually did arm day I'm not like arm day all the time but yesterday was when we have some that alpha brain yesterday was a legitimate arm day and I thought cams already posts arm day and he does it every day so yeah I don't know he doesn't get tendonitis oh no cuz I'm going he's going this dude doesn't have tendonitis in his legs that's true runs it he's we you and I talked about I've shot a right-handed bow my entire well I shouldn't say my entire life when I hurt my shoulder I had to shoot a left-handed bow but for the most part I've shot a right-handed bow my whole life so my model left I mean my left pack is bigger than my am i right mm-hmm my love Scheldt yeah my left tricep and then on my right side my my right trap the way my whole right side sits in my bicep are also from pulling a boat my inner life and you and I talked about you know if you really wanted to balance yourself and stay symmetrical you almost need to shoot left-handed as much as you shoot right hand yeah well that's the key with martial arts put it away I mean that is what cams doing he's running right it's all lower body and then he's literally lifting upper body every day which is a balance I mean people are gonna people are definitely gonna say well you can't train up her body every day but he trains lower body every day so is it like I've thought that many times well he's doing low weight high reps not always solo either by the way that guy's strong as fuck like it'd be kind of stunned how strong he is like he came over here and he picked up my 125 pound dumbbells and he was doing presses so he's pressing 250 with dumbbells you know and he's mean he's a crazy guy like I don't know anybody like him so ladies doing he's doing low weight high rep running he's doing that but I'm saying he also lifts 250 with dumbbells and the only weighs like 175 pounds he's a pretty crazy shit he's a felon to 175 and I'm 225 he's attacked he's a a madman like he I've met a lot of people that have a lot of Drive but he is a very unusual Drive it's real weird have you ever done the math on sometimes you shoot most of the time you shoot a hundred arrows but I know there's been times where you and I have shot where you've shot where I know I've shot over a hundred arrows and you've shot double that because normally when I'm about saying I feel like I had a good practice you're like yeah man I feel really warmed up right now you know where that comes from comes from playing pool when you play pool this is this is real high level competitive pool and I was never high level but it when I got to be as good as I got I was always a what you would call a B player it takes a lot to become a bee player but I was always a bee player and there's a there's an a player and then a player like borders Pro and then there's Pro which is like stratospheric like you know Earl Strickland Efrain ray is best to the best top of the food chain this is different level but when you play pool as you get better and better one of the things that that you get the develop like just feel and the feel really kicks in with me about eight hours in so I would I would be practicing I'm not joking eight hours in I had a full-on sickness go ahead pull that I know you're trying to do it off them I how addictive of these goddamn on it protein bites holy shit I want stock in these right there good I hate for those this morning and I told myself I was holding a neat one I was just doing some shit around the house before I made breakfast and my fasted window was up and so I was like I can eat now so I just have one of these things eight one I'm like I'm definitely having two and then I ate two because there's two in a package and then I said fuck that I'm opening another package I ate four of them so I what is it seven grams each so there's 28 grams of protein I ate inside of five minutes these are so good they're from some Mentos the other day I said for anyone out there don't do it because if you do it whatever these whatever these are you're gonna go from like this is the new on it these are the protein bites coconut cashew and dark chocolate actually they're good I do I didn't have these Andy stump had these first and he gave me these out of his backpack where were we oh in Oklahoma we had done we had done quite a bit of a ride on the bikes for the day and I'm like I am starving to death right now and he pulled these out of his backpack and I just had to tell me those did you bring and he's like I don't know why I'm like those are gonna be gone these are dynamite my problem is in the morning I'm always I I do like to fast in the morning before my workouts what's the window you give yourself I normally don't eat until about 10:30 or 11:00 in the morning and what time do you eat at night before you go to bed seven oh that's good that's a good window yeah and honestly I I'm like starving but I'm not ready to cook yet or you know normally for my breakfast I'll normally half an avocado to a full avocado with anywhere from like four to six eggs and if I have anything any meat left over from the night before I'll slice that and have it with but these things on the way to the gym if I just feel like I don't have anything in the tank these have been awesome yeah they're very low glycemic index low sugar and even the proteins not ridiculous and when it's seven grams is that per bite or is that read that shit according to say most freaking serving samples dude I was reading something oh my god it says one bite yeah one by seven servings per container - yeah this is supposed to be one bite well it's the bite is like the name for it's not supposed to be like how are you gonna fit that whole thing in your mouth not to me that's a bite well it's they're called protein bites why wouldn't it be one square cuz you already bit out of it like you've been out of again that's two bites that's ridiculous it can't be one bite I mean you could do it if you had to if I wasn't on the podcast I would have done that like nothing people get real mad by the way they're gonna be mad at you for chewing on the mic can't be more annoying than Mel Gibson's freaking pen he's sitting over here dude nice guy he's a nice guy but he's fried there's a circuit that that just hit an overload and there's a black area where it used to be connected to the motherboard well you know more than me a nice guy what's funny is um you know my one of my followers is the Brad of all Brad's he does all I heard that guy on your podcast that was great podcast by the way he made that yesterday which is kind of hilarious John Dudley death start your face over Mel Gibson oh that's hilarious yeah it was funny but you have whatever that pin was my god terrible yeah well you know what it was I just don't think he could just sit and chill and when dr. Neil rear and was discussing all this hard heavy duty scientific stuff when in regards to stem-cell research and all the different I mean he's had I mean one of the reasons why he came on he wanted to come on the podcast and people like why didn't you ask him about his wife why did you ask him about the that's not what he was here for I'm gonna be respectful to the guy I'm fan of Mel Gibson he's a nice guy what he asked is he said can I come on the podcast and talk about the stem-cell research they're doing in Panama and the treatments that they gave to my dad at 92 years of age now he's thriving at almost it was a great podcast and you know i'm i'm i'm a believer in stem cell because you actually introduced me to dr. rowdy mcgee in las vegas save i mean potentially you saved my archery career well it's just we thank you from surgery if i well yeah and surgeries are freakin hit-or-miss right so that's what i'm saying i was lucky with my shoulder surgery that I got out of there good I know a lot of guys that are into their third one for the same type of thing but literally I got three injections the first time and went back for a second round because I think one of my tears didn't take and literally I took completely avoided surgery because of dr. McGee and we should talk about this because I don't know the exact specifics of what it was called what the original treatment was called but the original treatment the you and I both got a no long as we get but it's not available anymore it's it's because they believe this is what they're trying to make it legal but it has to go through a series of there's a whole process that it has to get it passed because they've declared it a drug because you take the is something about umbilical cord stem cells you take them and convert them and then that somehow another the in during the process they believe it's become a drug whatever that drug is I had a full-length tear of my rotator cuff now this is from an MRI full-length tear of my rotator cuff it was painful it was a real problem dr. rowdy McGee in Las Vegas Nevada shot whatever that baby dust is in there and the most recent MRI that I got which is over a year from his original treating but I knew that it felt a lot better but I have I just haven't got it checked it's gone funny enough I was with you both times right the first time which I mean I didn't say anything about but you had you had been struggling to shoot a lot because you know you just its wear and tear I mean the bottom line is it's wear and tear over life especially with you and I we do a lot of active stuff but for you to go back and you and I went in together last week and when he said he looked at you this confused faces said yeah hey a new MRI that tear is healed freaking massive it's massive that's the tear that would have normally absolutely required surgery or I could have just been in pain with an unstable shoulder you know what one of the things that I'm realizing is that over the years of essentially being engulfed in martial arts most of my adult life and even into my teenage years like it 15 I became the fanatic like from then on martial arts has always been a part of my life I've done some ruthless shit with my joints both of my knees have been reconstructed I've had some real problems with my neck in the past both of my shoulders of cause of problems it's just explosive crazy shit your arms are getting yanked in weird directions your foot windmills that stuff that's the easiest stuff that's probably saved me all that building well I really think that saved me because that's shoulder stability because that's controlled you know all that stuff that I'm doing that's all strengthening all these muscles around it and that doesn't bother me and it doesn't give me any pain what would give me pain is like off-angle punches like you land on someone's elbow in a weird way and you feel something hurt right now even thinking about or getting caught in something like Kimura and not tapping I've done that a bunch of times like a shithead you're a meathead you know you don't want to tap but you gotta tap but you don't want you like there's got to be waiting get out of this without tapping and then you get out but then you can't do chin-ups really three months that's happened 30 times in my life like no joke like where I didn't tap and then I was fucked up for a few months and I would tape everything up and keep rolling believe you hooked me up with what Damien in Des Moines for a tent plan and I really wanted to do jujitsu classes with him but I'm so afraid to do it in a class because for me it's my arms are my career right right and I mean it would literally be like turning a light switch off in your room my friend max a burly he's a professional pool player and he said the same thing he was really interested in trying he was so scared getting his arm bar getting blocked in an armbar and fucking his elbow up or a shoulder up and then he wouldn't be able to play well it's a real legitimate concern two days ago I don't even know if I told you this but Andy text me stump yeah he put me in a group text and needed closer and Jaco reached out we're in a group text and Jocko wants a bow and wants lessons he wants does of course he does so kind of like a knife in his teeth what full draw yeah and he's like just make something he won't break in half because he's like he will break it yeah and I thought oh shit if I've gotta have jock over I know we're gonna end up working out because if he's at my house more in two days I'm not gonna skip two days of working out so I thought I better hit the frickin squat rack because I'm more of a bike guy like almost of my leg workouts come from well they come from kettlebells or they come from from biking because I like the bat bike or ruck that's lame explain rock to people rucking is where you just have a full weighted backpack on essentially and you're just power walking you're almost going for an outdoor walk and the outdoorsman which you actually sent to me thank you because I kept telling you I want to do you know some power I want to do like pretty much I want to pretend like I'm backing out elk quarters to prepare for it and you said dude you got to check out this pack yes Atlas trainer and it's available at outdoorsman's com not a sponsor just nice people that make good stuff they're there they specialize in optics really most of their businesses and selling high-end binoculars 200 you know that yeah they're there they're the optics authority they're amazing with optics like they do a lot of you ever listen to the Jay Scott outdoors podcast no these guys got a really good podcast super specific to hunting anybody I mean it's not like this podcast whereas like we'll talk about all kinds of shit and how many dudes have little rubber muscle man up their ass he's had Cody Nelson who's one of the owners of outdoorsman's and they go into like edge to edge clarity high-end details of Swarovski Zeiss vortex like all these different by nose and they talk about you know all the different aspects of like what's what's the best shit to buy what's the best shit for this price point for that price point and they get like super geeky and in depth with it but there's no better resource than outdoorsman's calm like they have everything they have all the high-end stuff they're really good deals but they also have this Atlas trainer which is cuz their whole thing is western hunting and see when I think most people that don't know what hunting is or do not in the world which me prior to 2012 they think of hunting is fuckin Elmer Fudd some do with the orange vest on shooting some poor innocent animal what Western hunting is and this is where it gets really weird its Fitness with mental strength discipline and then hunting there's so much involved in it you're dealing with mountains so you have mountaineering hiking it's a tough mudder with a weapon it is yeah that's what it is people don't appreciate that I'm trying to get him to trying to get him to it because I've become and you are more absorbed like this backpack shit that we're talking about like what Remi does in a regular basis yeah Aaron Snyder and Snyder who does an amazing podcast called Cafaro cast it's a it's a Cafaro is a real high and backpack company they make like real rugged backpacks specifically designed for hunting and for military and tactical and stuff like that but Aaron Schneider where the guy who runs it is serious hunter and he does those crazy 30-day trips like out in the woods out in the woods just living off your back woods it's woods and bush put together in woods I'm hanging around Adam green tree too much they call it the bush I think we're officially killed this angel's wings you have too much body what there's too much mass in you you can go through too much alcohol like I have to think about you probably like 40 pounds like heavier than me so I have to have to put it in consideration know how much to take in no you don't this is great podcasts are made by friends and alcohol yep well that one didn't I when it was all of us you and me and Ben O'Brien and Sam so alt and Shane Dorian Jacko I'll go grab it you just keep us occupied yep Remmy Shane Dorian Ben O'Brien my wife jazzy fresh and my boy was there I think I got everybody we said Remmy right yeah yes shame on general ones jack or you want to try this McGowan I'm countin Brian little Brian try some local stuff we got some stuff that just got from Leo step over here I'll I'll take this sucker over yeah I made a note here that was B and I have no idea what that topic was we've shifted gears so many times this is Bowers Bowers whiskey and this from Bakersfield I was just in Bakersfield not a spa not a sponsor but nice folks that left me a nice glass of a nice bottle rather a whiskey so beautiful bottle you know I didn't know this but that area Bakersfield like that whole area that's where that's where there will be blood was all about you ever see that movie Daniel day-lewis and I loved that movie I didn't know that baby was amazing in that movie beyond right I actually really legitimately liked that movie I loved her ice but that's alright we get some more ice that was that was at least 20 ounces a good die we're not driving we're gonna be shooting arrows luckily there's no one here I know yeah and we're surrounded by concrete we saw some concrete by the way how great is that setup by the way I have to thank you for hooking me up with those block targets awesome only my arms are long enough to reach across this table anyone else you two came up way short take against the wall but these guys that do this this there's this hardcore backcountry hunting it's sort of what like what we're talking about before was worth there's levels to this and the way you work out is to stay healthy and to be fit in comparison to some guy like David Goggins some maniac some campaigns type maniac right but there's there's levels to like everything like some guys just want to go out and try to hunt for their meat and you know go out and you have a weekend hunt in Wisconsin or Colorado where every guys want to put orange on for seven days yeah they're totally content with that and then there's guys who take it as far as you can go weirdos well and then the weirdos amongst the weirdos right guys like Adam Adam Green true goes lives in the mountain and Facebook's the whole thing and Instagram lives the whole thing yep yeah it's it's a thing it's not what everybody thinks it is it's a thing and I think that thing gets clouded up by so so much distraction I think a lot of people don't know what the thing is you know so they think of it as being some oh nice JRE is that a Yeti ice bucket I'll be darned is it no it's a regular ice bucket this is yeah you have an ice bucket in we need an ice bucket oh for everybody who wanted one of these JRE there's Yeti tumblers they're gone 20 minutes I underestimate it sounds like my releases yeah I only ordered 300 of them but we're ordering we're ordering 2000 now let's I fucked up Sorry Sorry we'll get them as quick as we can hopefully Yeti if you just find Ben O'Brien on Instagram and yelling them don't do that poor guy Cheers um thanks for having me out my pleasure brother we're we're prepping people hate that sound they hate the sound of slurping they hate the sound of chewing I get it we're on a treadmill right now you're on the treadmill right now you're thinking about quitting and you hear someone chewing slurping like fuck this podcast man fuck this well I got off subject but what I was talking about I was gonna do some squats right because I felt ready for jock oh yeah yeah at least need to do 135 once but remember the other day when I was in rotties and he was bending me all around checking my arm mm-hmm when I hold a squat bar that is what gives me my pain right now do you get massaged often um I get I normally get it about four times a year I have a guy that I go all the way to Oklahoma for it's about 600 miles but his name is Lester Phillips you fly do you drive I Drive down there yes name's Lester Phillips he got 12 hours to get a massage yep he's at a he's actually at a fitness building called body masters but he is amazing at breaking apart scar tissue and literally getting into areas that most people don't take the time for and I normally go for two hours just for one joint but if you sober this whole time yeah but if you're doing something well it's arguable but it depends if you're doing something that's very repetitive in your sport then those particular areas build you know it's just like I would a lot of times he tells me that my my bicep and my forearm connector on my right side are a lot like what a fighters are that's a right hand prominent where they're numbing impact you know and the same with my left because as you're shooting it's just hyperextension mmm so you build that scarring in in there and when the scarring isn't you know it's restricting the muscle from moving properly you know he talks to me like he said if you know if you have long hair and you and you get out of the shower it's not all the fibers aren't going the same direction you have to like get all the knots and stuff out of there so essentially he's trying to break up those areas where the muscles aren't flowing back and forth smoothly so even though I don't have necessarily a tear I feel soreness at times I would say maybe even a chronic soreness but if I go and actually have that broken apart it's extremely painful to do but my performance afterwards is just night and day different yeah I think you should do it a lot I really do and I'm it's hard to find this person though that's the problem that's why it goes so far you know is to find someone that really really knows what they're doing do you have a Thai massage place in your town no I don't know yeah no ties make it up yeah there's a ton of them around here man and they're you know not not very expensive but amazing like I have this lady that walks on my back she's probably about 60 years old she walks about on my back grabs my wrist and pulls him up but she she stretches you out man it's like part of the thing is massage and then once she gets in that tissue and loosens it up and she starts pulling on your arms and stretching you out Thai massage is legit it's really helped some lady trying to rip your arms out of the side I'd be fucked without her would be fucked without a lot of different things but that's one of them yeah but this stem-cell research that they're involved in right now they're what they're doing right now in Panama because it's not legal in the United States that was just podcast yeah it was amazing right thank dr. Neil reared he's very good he's amazing they just passed a significant hurt on Texas yep so they're real close to being able to do that in Texas and it might happen as soon as the fall so somewhere around archery season then what you might be able to go you might be able to go to Texas and get all the same stuff that we're going to get in Panama what you should do man if anybody listens to that podcast or anybody's talking to talk to someone like me who is benefitted tremendously from it and I haven't even gone and done what he's doing which is complete next level in Panama yeah but I know TJ Dillashaw UFC bantamweight champion he's gone there twice now fucking had massive massive recovery from it it's amazing we're in an incredible time when it comes to medical science and technology and innovation like what they're able to do and fix and and heal people you know that have had really significant injuries that would have been a giant problem before of a friend of mine she works at the UFC my friend Heather she had a Achilles tendon injury from rowdy yes he did the surgery yes and she's six weeks later walking around without a limp dude she told me that sit would be six months where she would be in a cast if it wasn't for this new stuff that's crazy she's walking around without a limp remember when you were in there and I was rod he came in and he he had told you about the MRI and said it really looks like everything has grown back together yeah it's it's healed yeah and I just said that's some Tron shit right there dude yeah that's that's like to be able to reconstruct something without having to go under the knife for someone for me I went under the knife with my shoulder and I know that the difference in recovery between literally not being able to almost function a part of your body entirely versus them saying take it easy and work your way back into what you want to do those are two paradigm eeen they're like completely different universes right being in a situation where you're you know one you have to take painkillers which that's not cool to having to have someone that you're dependent on you know pack pillows under your arm and you steady for three days in bed and you can't freakin move around then you got this you know big wedge under your arm and you're walking around versus we literally went in went through the process get an ultrasound they find the place of target you see a syringe literally go in no different than if you go and get a tetanus shot you can see it in the ultrasound you actually watch it go in it goes in comes out and then it's done I mean and and you literally go home and you're in these things just go to work yeah I mean I'm really really hopeful for the future we just went into this past weekend Roddy looked at the MRI and he was stunned at the fact that my rotator cuff had been completely healed but I still have some little tears in the labrum area so we shot some right into the joint but again what they're caught they're constantly innovating so now they're using umbilical cord blood and apparently they're having massive results with umbilical cord blood and then they're using your blood and the PRP that was cool it's crazy to watch the Machine very cool it mixes it all up and then it puts it with the stem cells it's like we're living in the future man because I almost feel like I got gypped yeah I mean I I had a hard time carrying a jug of milk with my right arm a lot of people found that hard to believe because you know my arms aren't small I don't think in average but I had a tough tough time carrying a jug of milk in a hammer fist position and then got the MRI saw whew you know actually three areas where I just pretty much abused it tore it apart and got those three injections the first time two of them took I ended up actually rowdy had me back there for a Fox News thing because I sent him a video of me doing 60 pound curls three three weeks after the first stem cell injection and I wasn't even able to carry a jug of milk and I was doing sixty pound curls for sets no pain with no pain so I went there and did that well then it ended up slowly coming back where I felt pain in one area of the three so I had a different I had an injection then but what I had at that time was what we referred to as a baby dust but now you and my wife Sharon had PRP which was you know really really cool to see that machine work PRC mixed with stem cells that's right yeah right so it's it's and actually the very first time I came in they had us um he asked me to do a light workout after but then the second time I came back he had me do a workout before yeah he did that with me as well and then and then injected it and then we talked about the benefits of like the sauna and what that would do for it yeah and then now it's already at a different stage so I mean it's no there's no no doubt the progression of this is just it's like anything it just gets better and better and better and better what's interesting about Roddy too what's great about Roddy I should say rather than interesting is that Roddy is a student of medical science as well as a practicing physician and surgeon it's a good point yeah so he's constantly up on all the latest stuff he's not stagnant in any way shape or form he's constantly up on it so every time I have a conversation with him he's like there's some new research coming out of this place that shows this and he's just constantly on the ball with it and so the most latest thing was this weekend I mean last time I saw him was just a couple months before it's definitely on point with his stats yes oh yeah we were I was I had some speculation this activities taking place in LA in Las Vegas rather on a daily basis what they would be might like my real big question was how many times does the gay guy come on another guy's ass and yell out boo in Vegas how many times is he Ric Flair and Roddy was correct right he was like not every day and I think I think you're right everybody else is like all dude every day I'm like what are the odds Jamie just came alive this by the way this was at a very nice dinner how good is that steak house it was very good yeah the shout-out to craft steak at the MGM Craig was delicious so yeah we were having some of the best that Vegas could offer meanwhile Joe got on some subjects that were probably only probably only uh I don't know legal to talk about in a comedy situation you can talk about it anywhere now for now for like the next couple months and then they'll make that illegal yeah yeah Vegas is a great place to get meals it's like one of the best restaurant places in the country really is I want shout out to I want to hook up with Gordon Ramsay you did some you did some videos about hunting in cooking wild game but you're missing out man you got to do this right way yeah that's wrong missing out on it's kind of a cheesy rifle hunt with a hog but I think we can do way better and one I think you need to learn bow hunting just because you're missing out if you don't here's the problem let me speak for Gordon Ramsay real quick cuz I'm Adam okay I met him briefly and shook his hand let's hear that I think I know him very well I met him for all of 14 15 seconds he doesn't have the time man the guy's like 18 different TV shows I was watching him yell at some dude who's cooking somewhere he was yelling oddly enough the guy was cooking elk and Gordon was complaining about the elk it was complaining about it being tough and it is inedible good complaint and the guy ate it he's chewing on he says tender and delicious I'm more with the guy I think Gordon got a little he's doing a TV show man oh yeah I don't want to be cynical playing a character I don't want to be cynical but there's a reversed of all the guy did step way over the line he said he was trained by some of the greatest chefs in Europe and then Gordon Ramsay called him on and he said I never said that and then they video they played back so the guys obviously a dildo and then on top of that unfortunately buddy sometimes in life were dildo I've been dildo I've been Adele dough more than once I thought you said people do no I haven't made dildos but I have been one not that way not in the actual mechanical sense anyway this guy was trying to explain you know but he's not a chef but then there was video footage of him saying that he was a chef but the bottom line is Gordon Ramsay's playing it up and he's like talking about how terrible the food is and Chettinad I'm like that's his show his show was about sort of like Kitchen Nightmares it's like I show up but he show has to be kitchen has to be a nightmare for Kitchen Nightmares to work that's the guy that's the gentleman you play this guy I don't want to shame this young man this young man the young man but don't you think this is a lot like a guy who doesn't really know archery talking shit to you like your garden Ramsey and that guy's yeah I who like you know I've been finger shooting my whole life I don't need a release you know I don't use a sight because I shoot instinctive and you're like well you're just not gonna be accurate no I'm accurate I'm accurate and then he shoots and he misses the target and you like see I told you and then but you're a nice guy Gordon Ramsay is a professional asshole and I don't mean that in a bad way but I mean when someone fucks up that guy comes down on you with the hammer of truth watch my seven year was so annoyed at me she's like why are you still watching this we were in he warning cheese someone else she wanted to roll around on the hoverboards and I was like just relax one second I want to see where this goes they were the guy was like talking about Gordon Ramsay did not know how to cook elk all right but then I was watching him cook how come I won't think you know it either brother yeah see that's what I mean he needs to learn but here's my argument you don't have time for archery there yeah but I'm crazy exactly I have a real manual oblem I need a I need I need Gordon to get crazy he's not gonna do it yeah he's not the same guy I think you know that archery find the people that you know what I think archery is like a game with right now all fallen in place you got to figure out where falls in place my wife's English so Gordon David to try basically the same thing yep right yeah um that's her that's her I mean she was completely she had no literally no perspective to hunting before we met I mean imagine Sharon and I met on a plane to France we met again on a plane back from France right um she was from England I was from the US I just happen to be routing through Liverpool I said pretty sure we talked might not talked about on the podcast but I think you did I think I mean uh but it's a great story yeah it is a very good story better and then you're like Tim why don't get a number and then you met her again Hollywood we need a movie called love at first flight this is it you can have Nicolas Cage play an archer Bob gives a lot a limb with same terrible she is from England does not mean that they're the same thing that him and her just like Artie Lange is also from America and he is not as same as me we are different he has way more experience with pharmaceutical drugs and heroin and I have more experience shooting animals with a bow and arrow and it will always be such yeah do whatever you want to do in this life you know I don't think he needs to go out and hunt with a bow and arrow it one thing is it would require a tremendous learning curve right especially like my first experiences were bears over bait which is a much easier proposition it's a very controlled situation but is I mean I think controlled situations are important for any beginner yeah it doesn't matter sure right barring when you teach Braille and we just know how to fight one of the first things I suggest always they spar in advance belt they spar someone's not going to hurt them well mark talked about that at dinner we talked about a sparring yes right yeah we can you can read it marking all right we have some brain yeah I played a video for him I was really disturbed about we actually played it yesterday on the podcast did you this Virgil I haven't watch it yet no yesterday was its original Brendan Schaub and Brian Kay we talked about heavy sparring that there's guys that are hitting each other as hard as they possibly can and all that is is like an ego exercise you're not you're not getting better you're hurting each other you're fucking each other's brains up and mark and I were talking about that like how many guys get turned off to sparring because they spar with someone who just beats the shit out of them in a bad gym rather than spars with someone who teaches you just to get touched you just get touched in the face you know you got hit you know and someone who's fast but has control and then you learn how to operate without the the fear and consequences of like a wild gym brawl which is like really common a lot of gyms they have brawls where it should be just sparring but instead you're really just fighting all the time you're fighting constantly those people always wind up with brain damage like almost always so a real real issue with a lot of low level gyms or gyms where people haven't really considered the consequences of their actions did you yeah that's mine did you play that video that you showed when we were at dinner those guys getting knocked out yes that would want yeah this one yeah yeah mark was like this would never happen this gym never happened Mark's amazing I think it's important I mean any type of any type of beginner needs a controlled situation and you need training wheels I mean yeah it's important and there's that feeling but this is what I've been preaching forever is that feeling of not knowing how to do something and trying to figure it out is crucial as a human being I think we're human stagnate that feeling makes people feel weird they don't like being a loser they don't like being a beginner they don't like it but I think that feeling is crucial because when you get you really good at something and you get stagnant and you you don't worry about it anymore there's no growth there's no movement you know there's something about that that's very detrimental to the human psyche it's very detrimental to your growth and you're a constant self-examination which a lot of people don't like but I think is important this is why I think I think it's important for peace of mind because I think it may bring rocky moments where you you don't like what you find and you just feel like God can I just just just be cool with everything and really but I think through that path those rocky moments you get to understand yourself in a very pure way versus understanding the projection of who you would like people to think you are which is what most people exist in most people exist in this world of slippery shoes and shiny fucking cars and ties and wearing the right things and saying the right things all those things are sort of designed to project an image that's not necessarily you it's a cheap way of getting people to think greater of you whereas the only way to people think to really know who you are is see you doing something hard see you doing something difficult they don't know who you are if you show up and the the cameras start flash and you're on the red carpet you're in the perfect suit you hop out of a limo you got a gorgeous girl in your arms they don't know jack-shit about that it looks amazing I'd like to be that guy everybody would but they don't know a goddamn thing about you but if they saw you at Mile 59 of a 200 mile race and you're shitting yourself over a cactus in the middle of the mountains like campaigns then then they would know who you really are and I think this is also one of the reasons why a guy like you your hats my lipstick yes my litmus test yeah is hunting well I mean as hard if I'm if I ever really am at a point where I feel like is this gonna be a legitimate friend or is this gonna be someone that I just do business with then that's that's where I test it is in something tough because those people to me those people put themselves you know I probably you're probably the same there's maybe six or seven people that I talk to on a daily basis and then there's like a different tier to that but that is my litmus test if if people can can do those things and really prove themselves like at the tough tough tough times if they can handle it yeah if they can handle it those are the people that I want around me that's those people our fuel mm-hmm right you know yeah because when you're ready to be like so I just take a break right now and they're still going you're like I'm not gonna let him beat me cuz he's gonna ride me at the end have you seen ever seen Jacko's video it's it's just called good uh-huh you haven't seen it uh play it Jamie find that it's one of my favorite videos on the Internet there's a lot of videos in the internet there's a lot of countries in the world that Jaco and I met in it we literally pass each other in an airport pretty crazy took and we both had just enough time to take a selfie and we text it to you remember that yes yeah it was amazing listen we're gonna play it coz there's one thing I know that Jocko would never flag us off YouTube one of my direct subordinates one of my guys that work for me he would he would call me up or pull me aside with some major problems some issue that was going on and he taped my awesome we got this and that and the other thing and I look at him and I'd say good and finally one day he was telling me about some issue that he was having some problem and he said I already know what you're gonna say I said well what am I gonna say he said you're gonna say good he said that's what you always say when something is wrong and going bad you always just look at me and say good and I said well yeah when things are going bad there's gonna be some good that's gonna come from it didn't get the new high speed gear we want it good didn't get promoted no time to get Oh mission got cancelled good we can focus on the other one didn't get funded didn't get the job you wanted got injured sprained my ankle got tapped out good got be unexpected problems good we have the opportunity to figure out a solution that's it when things are going bad don't get all bummed out don't get startled don't get frustrated [Music] if you can say the word good guess what who needs you're still alive they means you're still breathing and if you're still breathing [Music] you still got some fight left in you come on so get up dust off reload recalibrate reengage come on son yeah ah dang if that doesn't make you fire to hope you need to go to a doctor can people hear that on the podcast if they downloaded on iTunes that yeah I hear that for sure yeah we're playing that listen if you listen an empty friends in here I'd punch someone in the face right I want to shoot through someone's neck that's what Jaco is all about man when I run I'd literally hear that sometimes when I'm fucking exhausted I'm gonna hit the high heel I've never ran to that if I did I'd I wouldn't even be here right now I'd have died of a heart attack somewhere out of frickin had a cardiac arrest yeah I don't listen it to it when I run because I really believe that listening to music when you're running is cheating what that's easier are you kidding yep I'm serious yeah well I think that when you run it should be in your mind you should be you're such a with your thoughts alone and I think that when you run and you listen to music it's easier therefore it's cheating homos run it with your Walkman with your earplugs on alright go five miles then their ear buds different different to go two miles in five miles to you I can do two miles in 20 minutes and drive what you do two miles in the hills five miles is probably easier just running an hour right so you have to music you Britney Spears gets you through the last three don't have to it helps with like the mind games I'm sure at all I'm sure but that's the whole idea it's cheating I'm pissed so I was wearing shoes then yes right right this word wearing shoes is cheating what yes okay here we go we were watching a video the other day that Jaime almost made me throw up was a dude who was carving off of his calluses with a knife he had calluses that were so thick he had a knife out and he was carving the couses off and then a dog was eating them well I don't know about the dog eating him part but I've definitely carved off calluses he's never seen councils like this I mean I don't know this guy living you've been walking bare feet for several years I'm just pissed because last time I was here you talked about the facts okay what I talked about last do we have that coin flipped over saying yes please all the implicit carving off chunks of his callous with a fucking knife dude and the dogs gonna eat that of course he will says man cuts calluses off his foot that's not callus is that fuck dead foot like mr. deeds is on YouTube right now he's moving around though he's alive look at that look at this look at this leave this leave this come on son goddamn fillet knife anyone who was a trout anyone who's watching with the podcast anyone who's listening with this bring up please YouTube this dog dogs gonna eat it that's a starving dog I like that beagle dogs confused it's like am I out he's like this blue cheese or humans it's this blue cheese there's this little trimmed yeah it's a hard video to get over I thought I saw that video I had to take a leak at like 5 o'clock in the morning I try I always do this man I was I'm thirsty at night and I'm like you shouldn't drink because if you drink then you gonna wake up in the middle of night you're gonna have to pee you know that thing but I might bet I'm thirsty fuck it I'll deal with that later i'ma living in the moment kind of guy oh yeah at 5 o'clock I'm peeing and all I'm taking about when I'm peeing I'm shaking my head thinking about that dude chopping calluses off his foot with a goddamn cleaver I like that I think they could serve that with the cheese plate that guy probably runs barefoot well last time I was here serious calluses you talk to me about having kettlebells and random places so that as you walk by him you can just grab them do a few sets yeah go to failure yeah right yeah now you're freaking running with no music because it makes it tougher yeah I don't want to be a pussy other people running with music you heard me people listen the Rogan podcast right now while they're running turn off some kidding Jesus Christ I don't really think your pussy I listen to music all the time when I'm on an elliptical machine if that makes you feel better you told James Hatfield that Hetfield that you listen to his podcast that more air is a new record that morning well you're working out I did yeah I was in the gym lifting is your pussy make that Mongoose by E I like the fact of italic is still going hard you know like 85 years old I went to their concert in Iowa my buddy Torsten his wife Trina she works for Q prime hooked me up on some tickets to the Metallica concert in Iowa damn and they freaking rocked see butoden from Metallica on the world wire tour get rid of the goddamn pop-up son of a bitch Laurel is this jim breuer is actually the one who hook there he is oh another pop-up Jesus Christ welcome to the world we live in up pop it people are so greedy this is crazy yesterday Sharon was looking cuz I'm still I still have my real wedding ring on my wedding ring I have mine too I know but have you seen any of those weird videos of people stripping their fingers off on pull-up bars and stuff I have a friend who had to get an operation not a friend a dude I know who had to get an operation because while he was doing jujitsu now he knows he's not on the list well I know him but I don't know him I don't his number okay he's like I don't have your number or your email and never emailed him anyway his his wedding-ring bent and dug into his finger was training something happened imagine how strong like an armbar has to me are the pressure on your joint whatever the fuck it was but it dug into his finger so deeply that he had to get it so talking shit so you been trained jiu-jitsu oh my god oh my god indeed what do you got it what pictures do Jitsu but not happening Jimmy Fallon injury that caused Ring ovulation it was about with ring ovulation a finger injury that looks and sounds like something from a horror movie okay let's so that was his wedding ring as well yes rip the skin off his whole finger I think I'm down I'm down for the tattoo let's see this bone I'll get that queer red and wedding a cot - you know that tattoo that guys get I have tried to get it but they talked us out of it two different tattoo places said it was the jinx said if he if he do it it's like the curse that's not true my friend Big John McCarthy has that shit he's been married forever happily married it's given time not so how long could him laugh I mean he's almost dead just kidding I've met him he's super nice but I'm just kidding but brings her archaic you know there's a company that makes a rubber ring yeah yeah literally that's what I was talking about yes you tried to put that shit on my wife and spit my face here's what's weird my Sharon was gonna buy me that for just because I kept telling her like I'm worried about ripping this finger off right mainly because my wedding ring is definitely too small so she was looking at some of those silicone rings and we were literally looking at it on her iPad in my kitchen I opened Instagram and started looking it's like sponsored ad buy that ring company isn't that what's weird it's very weird we were just talking about that we're just talking about that the other day that you know this we stuff you Jeannie and whoever was on the podcast we were talking about like having a conversation and if you have like Alexa or if you have like certain things that like listen to you while you're talking like maybe even possibly Siri then all sudden you'll go to Google and what you were talking about like slick trick broadheads or some shit like that will show up in your Google ads like what in the fuck maybe Siri series a total frickin she is a peeping tom she's a two-faced little ho I don't think she's two-faced I think hey Siri she doesn't have a single face you're a two-faced bitch oh you're not connected is that a bad thing though I know it it's weird yeah that's bad what I mean it potentially you could view that as something like I would probably want to buy that and now that it is you're in an easier way for me to do it that is kind of I'm just going that was advocate do you say oh my god I'm gonna die out here at that time Siri can step in and say would you like me to call a helicopter but when you're looking at rubber rings for your wedding ring and then it shows up on your laptop yeah there's that point Jesus sellout this is to get to the bottom of this well it most certainly exists with Google because I've I've looked at like what are you cheers I've looked at some you're milking it over there I'm all right sadly I smoke pot though you didn't oh you did a little Shh don't tell any sponsors I might have made that last part up this that the problem is like you'll be looking at something super obscure like like a Casio watch sound like a Co that's Casio yeah all right it's it has it's good one I like this one it's like a pro Tek it absolutely doesn't have a sender and a compass in it totally doesn't look like it but the eye button all sudden they'll show you whatever you search for whatever it was whether it's surfboards or fucking Hilda Burke tents they'll be for sale and you'll see like amazon.com ads for like what you're like I was looking at psy spy knows the other day I read it well you're gonna talked about it yes actually yeah but then I read a review on them and I actually googled them but then like everywhere I went if I went online I would see a little Google ad for Zeiss my nose I'm like this is kind of creepy but that's different I think if you google search it you're on the grid you are here if you're on someone else's device in your home kitchen it's not like I was looking at it on mine right I was on Sharon's iPad then she was ordering me a ring on her iPad and we were talking about it then I opened my Instagram up and here's the silicone rings as a sponsored recommendation within my Instagram feed he's backing up you gotta back it up back it up back it up Gmail is free for a reason these are all free services we're using and not paying for so you have to give up a little bit to get these cool things you have to give up your I get it your baggage here's my position my whole everything I think of is out there I'm a professional talker every every the most fucked up ideas I've ever had have all been recorded it's very true 100% true there's no getting around that like I don't have any come up with some crazy stuff anybody would any but I'm telling you there's nothing special about me anybody would if you didn't have a job and you had enough free time and you weren't worried about paying your bills and you were your you were in tune with the universe anybody would we all would there's nothing special about me cheers Andy properly in this time yeah does not bother about that freak jumping off cliffs flying around posted his video today I know you want some of that no good good for you I'm glad stay away from this this is a bad drug here's the government this is a drug the government doesn't prove Oh California does Jeff Sessions was in town today good grief who's telling people my to stop letting Mexican people are watching this but it's actually five feet away from me but it looked like a fog machine in Hollywood right there like some horror movie yeah do you know um remember when I talked have you ever listened my podcast with Mike Slinker yeah sex yes I've listened to every podcast you've ever done that's crazy knock on glass yeah Mike actually went to dr. McGee did he yeah he couldn't pull his bow for almost a year because he had so many problems in the shoulder and he was really dreading the surgery because he was worried about his downtime and I told him like man you need to to call rowdy because there's a possibility you don't need the knife and so he went down there and he ended up getting an injection I think in September of October October and then he came hunting with me in November and we actually shot together and he goes this is the first time I've been able to shoot my boat in a long long time it's crazy wow that's amazing it's just so cool that there's something like that out there for people and there's a bunch of different versions of it I know people that have had really good results for some places they take the stem cells out of your fat they like to give you a little baby liposuction pull some fat out take the stem cells mix it up shoot it into joints people who had real positive results with that it's weird that we had we did it the way we did it with the blood but then there's also the out of the bone marrow which is supposed to be more painful it's supposed to be more painful but it's also supposed to be really effective daniel cormier had that done he had real good results with that he had that done with a knee injury and he was concerned like I think I believe I don't speak out of school I'm pretty sure was an MCL wasn't the big one it wasn't a CL the ACL is the big one that's a tough one that's the stabilizer one that's the one that goes through the center of the knee I blunt blowing both of those out heavy really yeah cut on yeah both of them reconstructed yeah the first one I had done where they take a chunk of your patellar tendon with a piece of your kneecap and a piece of your shin and they open you up like a trout and they fucking screw that baby in I don't know if I've ever seen you the front of your kneecap yeah you can see it there's like that's a big cut normally get those barbell jeans up these are barbell joins minor to you also not a sponsor you can kind of see they're awesome guys they're great what's a great product this calf I'm not flexing that's just what my calf I am I'm not I am I've lured your flex I'm not at all look look all right see I'm loosing I'm very loose flexing my so wanna look cool this is great now but it was it was in pain for a year a solid year like I couldn't kneel net no kneeling there was no kneeling going on if I had a suck dick I'd be in real trouble dude not my face there was no way I'd be able to still that's the alcohol talking the point is is painful but the other one that I had done I had it done with a another planet I had it done with a cadaver and that way easier yeah that was way easier and but way weirder because you're thinking about you guys some dead person's parts in your body my father well I shouldn't say that Sharon's stepdad has a pig heart and he's pretty proud of it Wow here's a pig heart yeah brew it in a pig what you mean it's a pig heart like it's his no they used a pig valve in his heart okay they can't do that with a whore I don't think so but they can do it with parts right pigs are super similar apparently to people with certain organs to the point where they think that there might be a time where we use genetic engineering to manipulative to grow human body parts what yeah the real they're real clothes apparently to figure out a way to combine human their scientists grow bullish on pig to human transplants Jamie just pulled up an article let's polish me what is the website science mag and this is something that they've apparent there's apparently enough similarity this is coming from a dummy by the way settle down enough similarity between pigs and humans that we might be able to grow their organs grow our organs rather inside of them and so like if you need and if you needed a new liver or kidney or if you needed maybe a bow or something they could possibly grow it inside of this genetically altered pig because they're really close to us it's freaky shit man it's definitely freaky it's freaky shit because uh one of the things that I've gotten more and more adamant about from being around wild animals is that that's really the only way animals should be I mean there's one thing like your dog like shades yeah I don't want shades to be wild she's sweetie right mm-hmm you know I mean you wouldn't make it that's a different thing she wouldn't make it it's a different thing the pet is a different thing and anybody thinks it's not a different that's a family member my pets are family members my dog Mike you know if I have an interaction with a dog it's like I love them it's not the same as the way I feel about a wild thing a wild thing I want to be wild I really want them to be wild because I just think that we fucked up we got real comfortable with this way of raising and treating life outside of our own species in our own Road are you sure right and you'd be right yeah even our own has been I think the whole I think the whole picture is completely different now people won't get it that mean we want our pet dog to be part of our family yeah but the reality is if they were legitimately out there in the wild they would be dead that quick my kids got rabbits they're useless we have to give rabbits but okay okay we'll get rabbits they don't give a fuck about those rabbits they go like a week without even looking at those things they just don't care and the rabbits stay chill with the chickens of the chicken coop so everybody's good rabbits you having a good old time if there's so much to do here's the thing what a rabbit is is a small prey animal that has to adapt its environment so if its environment is them being outside by themselves all the time well I should expected them to be domesticated they're basically wild in a cage you know they're not constantly getting direct contact with people but don't you think some people could be argued the same yeah for sure what was not I haven't let you see this yet I'm gonna let you finish your point this is just such a difference between them and a dog like the the idea of that a rabbit interacts with you with the way a fucking dog does is bananas you're losing me if you don't tell me you like dogs more than you like rabbits I can't talk to you you cuz I've got dogs that are like little people okay I mean they're they're like of my friends like Marshalls my friend he's a one-year-old friend that I have he's one friend who's one years old he's literally your best friend and there's an he there's like do nothing separating you from his best friend no we're we're super tight we're like this doesn't steal food off the table which you will if I'm not me but that's your side to his side yeah he's a hundred percent dedicated you know even if you stole food from his side he would still be your best friend the next day he's just gotta know the rules can't be stealing food climate on the table the fucking savage like dogs would just jump on the table and just they you don't realize how like oh that's of course so the food is why wouldn't he jump up there it's amazing you've been able to stop him from jumping up there the moment he gets in the room that's what's really amazing here's what's crazy though if people had to really go out in the world and defend them fend defend themselves like our dogs would that are technically family members there would be a very clear line drawn yes but they don't and that's why we're delusional and then there's movies Disney movies Bambi all that crazy shit Yogi and boo-boo well these that rabbit movie because when we got on this subject most recent one no Sharon brought up that movie that was like the darkest kids movie was it Ted no it was like it was a rabbit maybe a rabbit movie what was the name of it look it up Jamie it was like it was considered one of the I don't know one of the darkest kids movies it was where it was all about rabbits and I'm trying to think de name of it it was I don't even know what that is I there was a YouTube video showing pretty much it was like a highlight reel of that movie and it was to I think a Marilyn Manson song and it was crazy it's pretty dark I think it was called bright eyes or maybe that was the theme song to the movie bright eyes a dark rabbit movie dum-dum-dum seriously you need to look that up on your right eyes imagine fuck Bigfoot that's a seven-foot rabbit who tries to bite your head off with those giant teeth I don't know simply rabbit I don't know if I'd be that terrified a terrified seven-foot grizzly I'd be way more terrified sure seven-foot crocodile way more terrified a seven Komodo dragon you find it what is lip down maybe yep that's it that's all pressing Rabbit movie it is remember this but you need to watch this wow Watership trailer if we play it will get yanked off of youtube but I'll play that we can't play any clips dude it's crazy today with the hold up oh it's not go ahead take it take a leak hey Jamie while we're talking about alligators or crocodiles you got to see this this is actually one of the guys dragons yeah this is a new short film coming up this is one of the guys that is he documents wildlife look at the mouth and he's he's a hex advocate but he wasn't a hex advocate first mm-hmm he was a well let's explain what hexes explain it the X HECS rather is uh it's a company that makes these suits that apparently the the idea is that they block an electro magnetic frequency that people admit is that my same yeah you're good an electromagnetic current there's something body emits that they think John Dudley has left the room he has to be I don't know this is the most honest way I can say this John is a big believer in this heck system and I don't know if it works but I know a lot of people think it works and there is a test that they use where there's a machine see if we can find they have a video of it explaining how it works and in the video it says it in there there's on the website there's a video link see the video link yeah see it where says videos third from the yeah there is there's something with a show they can swipe their arm over some sort of a machine that is designed to detect electrical current that comes from your body and they do it with just a normal arm with like a shirt on and then they deal with this hex suit on and the hex suit it blocks whatever that frequency and so the idea is that we're assuming that somehow or another the animals might have some sort of method of detection by way of the actual electoral energy that's come from a person do I know if that's correct I do not I do not know if that's correct it's fascinating to think of though because I wonder how many different animals have this interesting sort of ability to detect things other than just smelling and seeing like maybe there's a feel maybe they have a feel and apparently these things are particularly effective with predators which kind of makes sense I guess that predators would it would feel the electrical frequency that's coming from a nervous scared animal or something's trying to run from it and these things are really effective apparently with coyotes and this is this documentary or this little short film rather dances Dancing with Dragons perfect timing I just explained hex to a tee I'm a wizard without knowing shit barely got through high school this is so apparently this signal whatever the the human signal is I mean that the fact that they can detect it in this machine and I've watched that detection it's real it's legitimate so something's happening that the Machine detects I think we would be foolhardy to believe that animals can't detect that as well now is that mean that it will work on everything I believer I'm a believer too but this is what I think I think it's there's a whole there's so many factors when it comes to getting close to an animal I think they have so many senses I think they could smell in some insane way that we can't even imagine they can hear shit we can never hear they're just tuned in the idea that that would be it that they wouldn't have some other shit that we haven't really thought of this would be a good guess for you his name is Forrest Gallente he's actually he's got some really cool stuff coming up that I'm not able to talk about but I I know you and not four things or yes I know you enough to know that it's in your wheelhouse but this is all hundred percent wild I think I don't want to say it wrong but I think it's at a certain place down south of Mexico this yeah yeah yeah absolutely so this um he he just had a happy memory that came out he's in a document he's in a heck suit that actually has a pattern that resembles the saltwater crocodiles whoa did you notice that part I did that one but I only did once you brought it up I was making he's mimicking in the behaviors of a saltwater croc so that he can literally be within a few inches of them so did they want they would probably real dangerous to try that even the way he did it but did he try it without the heck suit like they try like a like a rash guard with the same exact pattern on it yeah yeah there's there's there's a lot of really good videos showing the difference between how much interaction you can have with certain animals that especially ones that have it's scientifically been proven to test to sense it yeah so you know in the wildlife community things like sharks and Shark Week obviously have a huge amount of funding behind it migratory birds same thing so all that stuff there's been very good documentation on you know electromagnetic fields and what animals can see but when it comes to like the hunting community obviously there's not a lot of big funding behind it because it's a much smaller community but things like this things that are on Animal Planet or Discovery Channel I mean these are things that are at I think a higher level of you know maybe testing versus what we have in the hunting side and I just know that me personally as a hunter I've experienced more like up close interaction with it so I just find some stuff really is it possible that that's like a placebo effect that you maybe just we're in a really good spot with really good wind and you had a few experiences so you put it together and you said this is what's happening is it possible it's but in the same sense I'll leave that up to you I think it's possible to but I just what I brought it up because I think I think it's possible but I think people want one or the other right and I think it's also entirely possible if there's a machine that can detect your electrical magnetic frequency or whatever the fuck that is they when they do it over that machine there is there is I've seen it yeah ok so what's happening there and why are we assuming animals can't see that well we definitely see at night they could see at night yeah right they knew things that we can't do they smell things we can't smell they hear things we can't hear we have intuition why would we assume that their intuition is not thousands of times sharper than ours they're running away from fucking crocodiles and shit do you know that um I know when you did the podcast with James Hetfield you guys talked about bees a lot do you know that bees when they go to and from certain flowers actually they leave an electromagnetic signal on that part so that actually other bees can see that and know that something is another bee had already been there to pollinate that here yeah I've got a video I can show you that actually shows that but did I just ever tell you about my experience with bees on fear factor yeah which is super cool yeah they got together this was a crazy moment they had trained be easy communication contest yeah these bees of this guy had brought in who is a beekeeper and then while we were doing a stunt on these people and they put the bees on these people all of a sudden this local bee hive emptied out and came to visit and they all all the bees got together in the middle of the sky and talked and we had to sit down for like a half an hour the guy was like you know we're not gonna do anything when I got we have to step back and let them work this out so he just knew he knew how like these alien beings are gonna communicate with each other how they figure their life forms man and we're just like odds just bees no it's not it's a little weird life form that can fly that somehow into the figures out they exchange information with these other weird life-forms they realize hey we don't we didn't ask to be here when I try to take over your community we just we showed up because we're doing fear factor you know the wiggle dance the little thing that bees do yeah the wiggle dance what is that they say that's they assume that's a that's actually an electromagnetic dance that's done to where it gives a signal to the other bees to where they can actually know what they're communicating so they can say things yep do they know like how complicated the speech can be well I mean obviously if a bee is sitting in a hive in my bush out in my front yard and he knows to go three blocks down and two blocks over and getting into those purple flowers or in someone's front yard they must know pretty dang good do they know I mean we just we just if they had a hex suit on they probably wouldn't be able to figure it out be screwed that's an interesting idea man that there is really some sort of electrical field whoa electrical fields of flowers James simulate the sensory hairs of bumble bees holy shit yech seed on the bumblebee and he's like nothing's getting pollinated listen what that says electrical fields of flowers stimulate the sensory hairs of bumble bee so their hairs are feeling where the wind is pulling them there they're feeling some sort of electrical charge to a certain little little green advanced metal fuck man that is we're just because they can't send emails they don't do anything that's really we we've so slept on bees they're dying off like they're easy because they're super cool they're super cool yeah yeah yeah people that don't give a fuck about bees like those are like the most hardcore the most hardcore Radical Republican guys okay we'll figure out mechanical bees don't worry about it there's a black mirror it's people that are like that man that was a good show dude did we start though Sharon and I started watching that because of you did you watch the dog one with the robot dogs yeah we watched terrifying show right yes you're like oh this is all like well within the realm of possibility all of it it's almost like a warning show it's like a fuck oh this is what could go wrong every episode of that did you see the one with the viv any spoiler word so with the video game did they put a chip in your brain do you see that one yep holy shit man that's a hundred per second it happen oh it's going to happen so fucked we're so fucked we're so fucked it's gonna be bad it will get it's gonna get really good - I think it's a sits at the same your arm yeah that is true I think it's gonna get weird and it's gonna get really good I'm very optimistic you know a lot of the most I don't know a lot of the most informative stuff that I learned in each and every day or from my boy that is in college right now Harry yeah and actually I think he's in charge of his science club social media I forget what it's forget the Instagram you'll have to look it up Jamie I think it's like Simpson Simpson chemistry club or something but he's everyday every week he posts different chem facts like chemistry facts science is crazy if you're someone who doesn't really study it there's a lot of ridiculous information out there you start looking at that and you realize any of the stuff that we're talking about it's a hundred percent possible well there's every new innovation builds on potential new innovations that branch off of them and they're always constantly pushing the curve it's like they're not staying stagnant in any industry like there's nothing we're technologically everybody's stagnant whether it's autumn Oh automobiles like they're getting better and better every day computers better and better everyday phones better and better everyday TVs better and it's just never ending it's not the are on this constant state of innovation and progression that is really stunning to watch because we're almost like watching some cascade of complexity that is reaching some infinite point the the newest latest HTC vibes these virtual reality goggles you put on they're just they're letting you know hey this is the future the futures other realities in pill form other realities you're going to be able to put your hand on a building it's gonna send you into another dimension I mean these are really real things that are gonna make sure us real matrix really real matrix within 50 years years do you think it'll desensitize I mean they say video game well back in our day they said music right music was what desensitized people yes right that's the basis of now they say video games this is easier now it's not recently said video games are causing violence which is like come on man I don't know if it's causing violence but I would certainly I would certainly think that people desensitized to blood and gore yeah because I mean you're right back when back when we were well you would have been before me but like I don't know Grand Theft Auto it was a little bit after my time like for me it was mortal kombat oh yeah the adult population couldn't stand Mortal Kombat because you ripped someone's spine out and held up in the air talk about that though instead of being desensitized aren't they just not sensitive enough yet because they haven't been even exposed to it so like you're right there where the combat lived through Vietnam like they they saw all of that and we didn't as kids you're a hundred percent correct powerful young Jamie good point very good point that's a super good point because that's really exactly what's happening you know they're not experiencing real violence and maybe that's the answer maybe it's like the real understanding of what real violence is would would make more respectful of real violence so the more disconnected we are with real violence the more almost cartoonish expression of violence as being an alternative for being bored being an alternative for being like bullied or tortured like instead of something to be avoided it's like you're your last hurrah before you exit this life like you've you've flipped over the board game you've pulled the plug out on the video game this and this is what like extreme violence is that it seems to be more of that maybe even than anything definitely could be I mean you know my boy is uh he's going to school to be a vet and he's been you know he's able to to look at luckily he works for a veterinary clinic in our town and he's personally been there for surgeries and all he's been there for several years so he's seen a lot of things but the doctors were originally telling him you know hey if you feel a little bit sensitive this or if you feel like you might pass out let us know but you know Harry has been with me through a big portion of you know his life so he's seen one of these things seeing things get shot he's seen things get filled rest he's seen things get broken apart and he's seen things get cooked for the family so he's literally seen all the stages of really what life is it's a port you know it's living it's dying and then it's being consumed by what is living so you know they were a little bit surprised by the fact that he understood all that but I think because he's experienced that he did understand it all for sure I mean he's experiencing it you know real life scenario verses in a video or in a book right you just there's no way to learn life from a video or a book what you can do is get exposed to ideas that will intrigue you and you want to have those experiences but this is a giant difference it's like the difference between watching porn and having sex it literally is right I mean that's the perfect example yeah it actually is it is the perfect example of it you have to experience things and you until you do you don't know and you know we're always battling for you know people take us seriously we're always battling for our position in the social food chain and all that clouds the way we communicate with each other - I think we just have to get way better at this and I think we're operating on some where we're in like this weird snake shedding of the skin stage we're just got to shake off all the stupid shit that was invented by slave owners all the dumb shit that's been like involved in our system from the beginning we have to realize like no one knows the fuck's going on we have to look at everything for what it really is and forget about the past let's what can we do right now what can we do right now and do you think it's like a lot of things in life where you really really like something and you almost go too far and then in the end you think oK we've gone maybe a little bit too far we're gonna back things off do you think that's the truth and what we're doing right now do you think we're almost becoming too lenient and then we're gonna get to the point we're like you know what we have to have some supplies plus some discipline yeah - where I was in the Starbucks the other day I thought about posting it but I didn't I actually thought about sending to you but I didn't but it was it was in the Starbucks and it said there was a bathroom that said any sex and there was a male a woman and a guy in the wheelchair I'm like since one since when is a person in a wheelchair a sex like you know it's almost like they're afraid to to put something on the door to where they just make it as broad as possible right and it's like you know we have to have we have to have some lines otherwise it's just nothing but gray well there's no here's the thing man I think all this is in response to the idea that men and women could against each other I think that's where we got to cut the shit I think if this idea that like there's a different like there's no doubt that you need women and you need men we need humans right we need each other yep so we got to figure out like why is everybody so hung up on gender is there an imbalance and whatever that imbalance is it's got to be corrected but it's got to be corrected honorably and it's got to be corrected honestly yeah we have to be nice to each other all of us we like each other girls like boys boys like girls that's how it's always been and any aberrations of that can really fuck your head up but I think they're more aberrations than they are the norm and I think we have to figure out how to make those aberrations lesser and lesser and no one's concentrating on that instead they're concentrating on boys versus girls and I think that's crazy it's like if you only like men I can't hang out with you dude you're gonna say some fucked up shit about women and I'm gonna go that's my daughter that's my sister that's my mom like you can't do that this idea that like we're on a team and we're on team dicks team vaginas trying to fucking steal our gold stupid it's stupid it's stupid we can't do that anymore just like we can't do team white people right that's not good either yeah it's not good team fucking beige people if you all beige people all beige people speak Spanish get on a team come on what are we doing hush it's all the same it's whether it's whether it's sexual orientation whether it's gay straight whether it's black white male female Asian Italian people saying people nice people interesting people different people we have to learn that we're in a global community like you really have to figure it out and we're closer and closer than we've ever been before but along the way we're gonna get ridiculous shit we're gonna get like people that are completely overreacting and all manner sexist and all men are rapists and all sex with a penis that a vagina is rape and it's like there's a lot of that going on right now but yes those are the echoes of the forest reaches of the idea and then that idea will pull back into the middle and then the general consensus will be established yeah that's what people do did I ever tell you about the time I went to India no I didn't I don't think so I went to India for just short of a month coaching and you did tell me this yep oh now I remember yeah it's a pretty good story but the first part was I wanted to try to blend in I've never been to a third so you are in your giant for a place that doesn't have giant people I told him I said I would I'll come down and coach I'll work for a month but I said I'd you know I was more worried about my safety than anything so I said I'll come down but you know I really want to I want to have a good flight you know I was going a long way said I wanna if I'm on the train because I knew I had about a four-hour train ride I said I'm on a first-class you know start to finish and I don't want to sound like a prima donna but I also knew that I was going to a third world country so asking for first class doesn't necessarily mean first class here right so anyway first class meant that my seats on my train had vinyl covering on there so I flew into my airport got off the train I was trying to blend in I had some old blue jeans on gray shirt literally stepped off and it was like the DJ freaking scratched the record from like song five to song one it was like and literally every single like a sea of people that were two feet shorter than me just literally stopped train stopped everything stopped everyone looked at the six and a half foot dude standing in this Indian fricking train train depot and I thought all right I summon the so much for blending in and went up to the first class train lounge which was pretty much to change loud a train lounge that had seats went up there made friends with a cockroach that was in the bathroom and then I got on the train did about three to four hours on his train we stopped a few times because there were some cows on the tracks you're not allowed to mess with the cows I guess so we had to wait for them to naturally move off the tracks team beep there was actually two dead bodies on her train have I ever told you this there were two dead bodies and they put the dead bodies in the on the floor of the aisle between the people so our see our seats had vinyl on there the first class the non first class did not I remember at one point I looked back in there was two dead bodies that had sheets over them and then in the far back of the Train like where the trains connect there was actually an Indian guy that was squatting down pretty much ripping his dong backwards so that he could take a leak while the in between the train it's like he opened the door and he was squatting down letting one rip between the trains and yeah I was sitting there thinking oh man I've got 20 days left here but in saying that once I got to where I was they were probably the best students I've ever had because they were the most disciplined every one of those students wanted to get out of that lifestyle and they saw that being a national-level shooter was gonna get them out of that lifestyle so every single thing I taught them they took it to a level that was far beyond what most people here would ever ever ever do did they built as well do they build bows they put did you teach them how to do all that stuff to their peeps some of their some of the people on their national team their peep site which is the small little circle that's in your bow string that allows you to kind of it's almost like if you can imagine a rifle you have a rear sight and a front sight so the peep sight is in your string it's a circle and it's your rear sight and then you align it with the front sight theirs was theirs was made out of wood they would have a stick with a hole drilled in it and they would put that in their string so imagine someone like that then you're they're giving him instruction and every single thing you tell him to do they'll do it to the tenth degree because they want out I mean it was extreme motivation because I felt like everything that I was doing from a training point of view was inadequate to what they were doing the only difference was they didn't have the education that we had they were disconnected I remember I would actually have to go to an internet cafe and I'd have to pay for five minutes of internet like dial-up internet to call Sharon so I mean you look at people that are like that they want it at a level that's so far beyond what a lot of I mean we're just floating in the gravy over here right I mean it's super it's true but it's true it's totally true you know you look at some of the some of the people I've I was a keynote speaker at in an International coaching convention in Brazil before the Olympics there and you go down there and you realize some of these people are they want it way more than the people that have it easy yeah in the times the case though right yeah that's the case that's the people that are hungry are the ones that are really struggling to make it and that's what gets tough is you know learning to stay on top when you have it easy when there's people that are literally investing every single day and getting to that point yeah it's that's the fuel right those that's one of the weird things is very few people who grow up with like some crazy inheritance plan and millions of dollars in the bank every let's go on I think it's a giant prop I think it's a big problem it's a giant problem with those people anybody that grows up in that scenario where you are never really taught the value of accomplishing things and then it's it's not just about securing your fate it's also about managing your consciousness and accomplishing things is good for you and you can't think it's not you have to just accept it and learn it and think of it as a sort of a growing experience and if you don't do that you're not gonna grow and if you don't grow you're gonna be fucked you're gonna be fucked whether you're rich or you're poor it's you're missing the thing the thing is not how many zeros and ones you collect that's not the thing the thing is like how well do you feel while you're going through it and if you're doing it wrong you got to figure out what it is well obviously having a million dollars in the bank is not doing it right if the dudes still taking pills and super depressed it's not the money all right so what is it what's the thing and you and I have both met a lot of people in that category I think everybody you talk to and the way everybody that goes to it's hard life is hard there's a lot of people that have fallen fallen into that category and it could have been me it easily could have I had different scenarios different circumstances different parents you know different neighborhood I grew up in any it can go wrong you you you can go down the dark road and all of a sudden you're fucked that's that's the case for all of us do you feel like I feel you know a lot of people look at me as an archer I've been have I made a very very good career I couldn't possibly have made it better I don't think for be for shooting a bow for a living I don't think I could have made it better and there's definitely archers that are better than me I never claimed to be the best I just claimed to be the one that is willing to share the most I don't claim that I have the most natural tile talent I just feel like I I'm willing to share the most but I don't know I also feel like I feel like there's this I don't know this part of me that feels like if I didn't even though I don't have necessarily talent the fact that I am willing to share it I think it takes it to a different level because I don't know if I've ever shared this with you do you know about my past as a kid yeah you told me a lot of different things about you burn your house down accidentally I did okay yeah so a big a big part of why I'd actually joined sports to begin with because originally I was a skater I like to skate and you know I wasn't really into organized sports and the craziest thing is you abandoning football yeah for archery yeah well but before that the reason I got into football is because my dad was such a great athlete that you know I played with matches and took it too far ended up burning my house down literally had nothing my mom was in Puerto Rico on a business trip my dad was at work burned her house of the ground I remember being there when my family was sifting through ashes literally trying to find something to salvage from our history as a family and my dad was such a stellar athlete that I felt like the only thing I could do to really make him proud of me at that point was become a good athlete so I focused on becoming a good athlete and that was my drive was because it wasn't because I really liked it it was because of the fact it was because of guilt it was because I really felt like the only thing I could do to make my dad who was a military guy someone who had definitely earned his street cred I felt like the only thing I could do was become this great athlete which he was in order to earn his respect and kind of did that in order to make up for the fact that you know I had this one moment as an adolescent where I literally burned down every single thing our family ever had holy shit man I mean imagine going Majan right now when we're done with this podcast you get a call and you realize your house was on fire and it's different now because we have phones but imagine we don't have phones every single picture you have of your family you know every single one this is gone every you know every single thing that maybe someone signed for you and the UFC is gone every single your black belt that you got from Eddie it's burnt it's gone like that's gone every single thing from right now into till you were born is gone that's what my parents lost and it was because of me so but you just you know what man they didn't lose you I think all right Lee the difference between you making a mistake could burn the house down which is horrific are you dying yep that's the big difference like everything worked out look here you are everything's great well and that's that's what was great about my dad was the fact that once that moment happened my mom and my dad have never ever brought that up they've never hold that they've never held that over me it's been me from the outside looking in thinking they've never mentioned this because they know that I feel so bad about it but me being competitive as a as an athlete was because I wanted to make my dad proud from that aspect and literally that competitive drive as a football player and track or whatever else that that fed the archery side because when I went to my archery tournament for the first time and I sucked at it I was naturally competitive and really wanted to be better at it not not that wasn't because of the fire but that was just because of really because of a principle that competitive sports put in me you know so it it's crazy how it's crazy how it all these little pieces build character but you know that's why several weeks ago there was a really big archery tournament and I get actually got wind which I'm not I'm not big on kind of feeding in or buying into negativity at all but there was some some negativity that I heard from other shooters that are shooting now and shooting currently saying you know why is this guy why is this guy popular why is a successful he's not even shooting right now he's not even competing and you know yeah dirty Green Monster yet and yeah exactly yes and and I I've been pretty you can do Gollum again it's pretty good I feel like I feel like these people that that feed on the negativity they don't understand that all these little things that have happened or building blocks and I want to use it as motivation to the people out there not everyone has a perfect picture you know people see where maybe you and I are now but they don't realize we also had huge hurdles before we got here and it's how you address those you know and how you take adversity that's really who defines you and it's a really really good opportunity for you to to set a precedence of I had hardship I made it over it and you know you can become inspiration for people by having that obstacle and then overcoming it yeah well I think that's the big point is that we all learn from each other now most certainly learned from you tell me about your struggles as well as I have from most of my friends that tell me about their struggles or things that I've read about are things that I've seen in documentaries or think we learned from each other and you get it where I think we're all accumulating data as far as like how the world works what's the best way to behave and what's the best way to live and we're all in the middle of accumulating all this data we're all taking it in from each other and we got to be open to it you know you got to be open to taking it from all even like although it seems kind of corny sometimes like I will read some shit by the rock or I will watch a Kevin Hart Instagram video and I get fucking fired up I'm like I'm gonna go do this man and I mean if it's not Jocko saying good or if it's not a stew or when I think about that David Goggins podcast I did very good dude I think about Goggins my Jesus Christ yeah I just I can't even understand that kind of mental intensity that was he was freaking me out man who's freaking me out in the most impressive way like I just I'm like he was a hundred percent that guy was a hundred percent seriously ready to die on a footrace he's ready to die 100 percent he's looking at he's not lying at all there's not no porterie he's taking it to the Darklands he's gonna take you to the Darklands will you follow will you follow him to the Darklands damla CEA's Wendy does the same with him he took the dark land in there with tequila in the tequila universe yeah well he'll do it with everything he's an animal but but those those people and they expresses itself differently and all these different exceptional people like Jocko is different than Tim Tim Kennedy Tim Kennedy is different than Andy they're all different but also all incredibly exceptional but there's something that they give off and I like that though when you talked about the exception um exceptional yeah that's what I think he called it david Goggins called it uncommon amongst uncommon people that's true yeah that is very very true that's the Kobe Bryant killing people right there they just I mean I read this thing about Kobe Bryant the other day I was just reading I don't know anything about basketball okay and I always refer to Jaime about anything so we have times is there in basketball have zero idea I don't know how long it takes could take a day how many quarters I have no idea I would imagine if you say quarters I'd say this four of them do you see how many periods I don't know how many half times but I was reading all the stuff about his high school coach saying that they would they would get there and he would be shooting baskets in the dark because they hadn't even turned the lights on yet he didn't be there an hour two hours before everybody that he would show up at these practices everybody would be at breakfast and he would show up with ice on his knees and he was fully sweated out like he just done three hours of work and I thought before anybody did anything there's there's people like that man and you can hate on them you can hate on them you could decide that this not worth it but you gotta the best thing you can do is acknowledge they're doing something that makes you feel funny yeah and that makes you feel funny is your sense of understanding who you are it's testing its testing how you feel about yourself it's testing how you feel about your place in the universe is testing it you don't want to know that there's some crazy Kobe Bryant motherfucker getting up at 4:00 in the morning you know doing deadlifts like shit I want to sleep but I also want to be number one bro yeah former Lakers player and head coach Byron Scott said he once found an 18 year old Bryant shooting in a dark Jam 2 hours before practice I used to do that throw footballs throwing footballs into a it was actually into the laundry basket it's not uncommon man it's not uncommon if you if you are three I mean you know my sleeping hours are super super irregular there's times where I feel like practicing or a lot times you'll probably get up in the morning and I've already built your bow and I built it four or five in the morning because two people that are the exceptional among their field they can't sleep if they know that they have to do something what is what as you guys are talking about this he just tore his Achilles this is probably one of those last things he did he tore his Achilles but in order this is like a rule in the game he had to shoot his free-throws it's a weird stipulation so he's walking back out with no Achilles and he does this it was pretty pretty impressive Wow you barely walk man holy shit no crying or nothing yeah that's how you have to be if you want to be a winner there's just no way around it you know swish hollow that's why I get the money huh look at my match and at that point it's just subconscious taking over anybody doesn't think that someone like Kobe Bryant doesn't deserve a mansion and all the money he has just not does not understand what he just did two swishes in a row with no Achilles just shut the fuck up I don't know shit about basketball I know that was amazing I've been pretty I've actually been pretty stuck on this subject in the last few weeks I hardly ever ever ever look at negativity I mean I really don't read it don't look at it but there was a really big archery tournament about a month ago and there was some other pros that had made some comments about me just saying you know how was John Dudley on the GRE podcast he's not even competing he's not doing anything and you know people wanted to know how I felt about that and I said the reality is there's several archers out there that have 10 times the talent of me no question I'm not saying that I have that but what really is shitty about that situation is when someone has 10 times or more talent at me and they do 1/10 as much to me that's a big problem so you think there's a lot of people out there that are not realizing their full potential so because of that they're critical of other people because maybe even they're looking at their own self and they feel like they're not I don't know their time I think I think they're looking at the problem is because the people do do that right yeah absolutely you limit yourself when you are not looking at what you're doing when you're so occupied on what someone else is doing you limit what your true talent is so is that my problem is it my problem that you have ten times the talent of me but I'm doing ten times more with it is that is that my problem those are big numbers okay let's say two times okay okay let's say let's say you have twice a town running naturally on it you have more by doing less right yeah I know you said I just feel like there's a lot of people doing that yeah there's I think the my actually think the majority I think the people that are standouts are people that don't have the natural true talent I think John Jones is a perfect example if he was able to literally a hundred percent maximize his talent how good could he be the problem is he's the one that has ten times the talent but he's screwing it up and there's guys that have half the talent that are bigger stars because they're actually doing it the right way and they're maximized they're almost there almost doubling their potential because they're working at it in the right fashion versus someone that has the true talent isn't really maximizing their talent mmm I know you're saying yeah but I think here's a good sign here's a really good sign this is an easy way to decipher it when you see someone complaining about someone else's success anytime you see that any time you see someone complaining about someone else's success and possibly equate again to like some in just in the world because they don't have equal success the person's making a mistake they're making mistaken even the way they're thinking if you criticize something cuz you just think it's bad well that's certainly your prerogative yeah right if it's especially if it's an art form or if it's something someone's created that's one thing but if you're upset that someone success that doesn't make any sense well they wanted to be successful they did the thing that it took to be successful they became successful and what's your point you don't have a point your point is going to a mood it's a little little kids version of what about me what about me well it's not fair it's not fair that some people are born billionaires it's not fair it's not fair that some people were born with birth defects where they don't have feet it's not fair that some people did their fucking brain doesn't work as well as yours there's a lot of shit that's not fair yeah look at what you got look at what you got you're doing well and you're worried about someone else is doing better why not just look at them why not just look at them and go what is that guy doing different what is she doing different than me how come she's so much more successful how did he figure out how to do that and look at it that way don't look at it like you're angry at those people that shit is wasted it doesn't do you any good it does zero good for anybody involved not you not the person your person you're trying to figure out why that was is fucking good good that shit is just bad for you and it's bad for everybody it's bad for the person thinking negatively it's bad for everybody around them the best way to do is like huh like even if you're not even hateful about it like like here's a good example like if a movie is fucking China in the box off it's like wow I thought it sucked yeah I liked it or whatever if you freaked out hos fucking up movie Jumanji are you fucking shitting me bro Jumanji a fucking piece of shit you know people get crazy the crazy think I made eight hundred million dollars for fucking Jumanji can't it's not good for you man it'll let that go yep don't worry about Jumanji worry about yourself she watched Jumanji it's pretty good hard twice kids man I haven't seen it yeah it's pretty good I thought it was very good it's really well done it's been hard though and the rock together you can't miss Jack Black and one of the best performances in years and whoever was the hot redhead chick she was great too she liked rock Thunder though I think Jack Black was good and she's got one of those Farrah Fawcett posters with that chick I just looked something up weird it's not a saw related the Jurassic world did you see that movie when it came out a couple years ago yep yeah it's the number three all-time grossing thank you what thank you kidding me hey fuck The Godfather Chris Pratt if you want archery lessons he does I bet he does legitimate you know did you see that an Instagram post that he put up of his sheep or lamb that he killed he had him put a bolt to its head and you know and chopped it all up and people freaked the fuck out like I didn't see it Chris Pratt's got some balls Tom I saw him post a picture of a rub in on a tree oh he hunts and he said said something about trolls what's that this is like a rap oh rapping yeah that sounds like this a new album yeah no rap he he does though goat uh that's not it there's a video where he shows the lamb that he's actually taken apart in the video it says it okay well know this but I'm what I meant is her photograph she's actually photographs of the butchered lamb and people lost their fucking shit man that's that's not it it's um there's actually like photographs of the meat in like there's a roast and the roasted areas right the one in the middle yeah and this one that's a legitimate I don't know if that's necessarily this clam dude that came from his face honestly says look at all this glorious food we will eat off him for a month his wolves becoming yarn as we speak he lived a very good life he was groomed and shorn his hooves medicated he wormed and no antibiotics necessary surrounded by laughing and loving humans including children to whom provided such joy nuzzled pet and loved every day no stressful traveled to his final destination drama-free just a touch of a usda-certified wand to his head and he goes to sleep the other sheep don't even notice it's like unplugging a TV then Wacka Wacka he's gonna butcher named waka waka my butcher waka flocka his side job then that's a rapper it is definitely you're so white white white butcher we're not magic you definitely want right now the meat is for friends family and gifts soon though it may be available to my followers as we test recipes and open up to market oh my god he's gonna murder animals for a living gotta get some things dialed in first including murder murder of sheep kind of just kidding like glorious how when has a a list actor ever considered opening angry a meat shop and showed a photo on his Instagram of the honest procurement of meat in an honest way then you see that post I made today know which one I have my airplane mode on so I can't post it but I think I made a post it was a Google search that I did there was 21 independent legitimate scientists that found that if you ate 50 grams of processed meat per day your chance of cancer was 18% higher holy shit just think of that number now is it nitrites what is it what do they think it's causing that well I mean it yeah preservatives that part wasn't clearly defined but I would definitely think it was preserved with based but they don't really know though right they know it's processed meat that's really dangerous yeah they don't know what it is exactly that's what it's awesome about how you and I hunt I posted it specifically to act surely some access backstraps from Hawaii last year hmm because I think I think it's maybe ignorant for people to automatically make a post saying you know you're a killer just because you post a picture of you know free-range organic meat that you decide to choose a touch versus it I know what you're saying but you got to look at it from their perspective idea even if they're not right and there's no right here the thing is there's they're right and you're right it's everybody's right that's this really what's fucked up about it like an animal does have to die you know that is a fact I and that does bother people including you and you when it happens and people don't realize that but that is true they don't but the AH the understanding at the end of the day is that this is the cycle of life and this is what life is really all about so they're right in you're right but this whole this expression of outrage like you should be expressing that at Burger King you should be and not Burger King just you know I'm not singling them out anybody that has fast food which I've eaten many times if you want to live in a society of twenty million people you're gonna have to live in a place most likely with this model where you've got in-and-out burger and I like getting a burger I like them they taste good let go out there we went there in Vegas they goddamn good right it's hard to beat so I don't necessarily hate those things but you have to understand what all this really is you know it's the whole thing is crazy you're here for a very short period of time as are these animals all of us are trying to stay alive all of us are freaking out one of the things get eaten and we're all just going like well I just want to be the best version of me I can be mm-hmm you're right and they're right they just they have an experience but they they have decided that an animal should not die there's no way an animal should dies that they can live and if they can live that way that's their choice they're welcome to that choice they just don't understand the merit of your choice the merit of your choice is just diametrically opposed to what they think should be and should not be a thing a person does you shouldn't be a per that kills animals but when you're engulfed in that world when you're living in the woods when you're when you're going through these seven eight nine ten day hunts you get this understanding of what this world around these things really is is this crazy beautiful complex interaction between predator and prey and it's been going on since life was here yeah just what it is and what you're doing as a hunter is just figuring out with your soft bitch-ass skin and your fucking shaky knees bad ankles and your weaseling yourself into a position where you can jump into the food chain yeah with Wolves around yeah that fucking conversation that we had about wolves did that change people's understanding what a wolf is yeah first time you came on the podcast you talked about all the wolves to try and take your elk away from you so that's a crazy story yeah I mean they're my all-time favorite stories yeah they're I mean there's an interaction going on predator and prey this happens your chain it's not like it's established and it's written in stone every level of the food chain is being competitive with the next yeah it's not like it is a very clear-cut concrete step to where every step is clear humans are here wolves are here Grizzlies are here access deer here turkeys are here you know how I would eject one other thing CWD yep chronic wasting diseases kill this thing diseases yeah diseases are creeping in and killing deer left and right and a lot of people feel like these diseases were created by people farming those deal you know is deer taking them out of the wild environments and letting them like like eat off the same food and constantly exchange bacteria with each other and that's what created this thing I've I've told people many times that I feel like Mother Nature is a form of karma I think mother nature will take care of herself I think as things below that level try to occupy their own status I think that's the balance that's a check that's in process I think mother nature natural I think if you decide I'm not gonna shoot any turkeys I'm gonna just let these turkeys go as wild as they can I think also and mother nature comes in and says I'm gonna throw a little Trump garden here called blackheads disease this is gonna kill every freaking turkey in your area and I'm gonna regulate this accordion fasting that always happens yeah well just get over and that's one of the things and it's being a Hawaii disease yep and then you look at whitetail in areas where maybe there's been you know I guess quote-unquote trophy hunters to where they've not really I guess regulated the population of white-tailed deer to a point where you know they're trying to grow trophy hunting so to me they're trying to grow deer with large yeah larger antlers so there may be shooting less numbers and then all sudden here comes this little thing called EHD which kills every whitetail liquid water CDs chronic wasting disease yes these different it's a midge that actually lives in the mud on the receding water line on a pond so as a you know as a whitetail deer would go in to actually drink this midge fly lives in the in the soil on the receding water line and it would go into the nostril of the deer and then literally within 48 hours that deer is dead if it if it gets that that virus look at the name of it epizootic hemorrhagic disease you know so it's like an embolic type disease I think a bola is a bola and hemorrhagic disease do not did have to be so hard me too I've never had a few more in my life this is awesome that did I pee before the show there's a difference wolves and coyotes I saw that picture it's an amazing picture somebody got a picture between this majestic black wolf with fucking white glowing eyes wolf looks amazing these two coyotes like fuck all this we gotta get away from that thing man that is so heavy go from EHD to two coyotes run from a black wolf how do we concentrate on that what's that do you think you guys could talk for a few minutes why pee go for it keep it together talk about sports sports all right Jamie yeah I mean is this the first official podcast where Rogen's had to actually like the second or third time in a second time yes reflects that yep no this is pretty pretty epic right here to make Rogan actually go the means he's consumed more than he's talked that's pretty powerful that happened some time to time I know I like that sweatshirt Jamie's actually told me earlier he's trying to make a profession out of video gaming which I would know about a refreshin but I stream from time to time on Twitch which is an interesting thing that I said you said your son does it a little bit or he looks at it yes is it well I used to play quite a bit or we had two accounts one was death by Dudley on PlayStation and the other one was bald hairless Yeti are you playing with them like you guys play hit like at times we did yeah we were big modern warfare guys um we really liked that and actually I met I met several cool dudes during that during that online play I always you know honestly I felt like if I was a competitive Archer and I would have been online prior to my competition I feel like I almost could have helped some of my performance anxiety when it comes to competition because there's so many you get so like into beating the guy that you're going against that it's you can almost freak out and you don't do things according to a systematic method which is really all a video game is is its if you follow the systematic method you can overcome the alloc algorithm right for sure but here we go that was rough one of those I gotta go now do you go ahead good nor what are you going to talk about whatever you talked about that was crazy I was talking about right I talked about my to online video gaming accounts with with my little dude Harry one was death by Dudley and the other one was bald hairless Yeti what do you play mainly modern warfare stuff yeah anything that you kill someone sadly and a go get you urine on me and Youngjae and we'll talk about the implications of that let's hear about this what is this what is it about these how come I have three days that's not good that's a lot of caffeine thank God you got that whiskey to dumb it down balance is perfect you'd be talking down to control is one of the drunker podcasts one of them right but there's something fun about getting together with a really good friend just get lit up smoke a little weed drink a little whiskey it's half a good time just have a good time today's been a good time that guy's a good guy John Dudley's a fucking good man I love that guy he's fun and he's also a master something that's very difficult to do he's a master knowledge estatic executing archery but instructing it teaching people it's a fascinating thing that archery man to me it's super important and I think that everybody goes to these like things were like what's important to them like to you might be a guitar amp you know might be certain drums or drumsticks it might be whatever the fuck you're into you know that might be important to you but archery I think is one of those things that most people miss you just don't get a chance at it you know yeah that looks good that looks like it would be fun but you don't know where to go and you never do it by far most people but once you do do it you realize like oh I can learn about life through this weird thing I'm pulling that string back and I'm launching a pointed stick at a target and I'm learning about myself like what I'm learning about how I deal with situations where I have to execute correctly under pressure even if it's just a minor pressure of hitting a target or the major pressure of hitting an animal you learned through that shit Jamie what do you show me there's this game I feel like we showed this to you a while ago but this is called the hunter call of the wild should we tell people archery part of it should we tell oh damn it's a compound bow yeah dude's got a real bow why does he go sideways like as gangsters probably so you can see I bet even once you pull it up it goes wow that's legit look at this John Dudley there's a goddamn archery video game where guys pulling back a bow and looking through a sight like you would like a real compound bow sight that's amazing with the whisker biscuit powerful biscuit biscuit and you go huh a lot of people still rock it a lot of people still rock them it's just about I wish the biscuit was infallible I wish it was the way to go seems so easy I just hate the name yes your biscuit yeah I mean I hate it but it's definitely provocative people don't know what we're talking about it's a real stress the arrow some people do most people don't most people listen to this podcast probably don't it's a type of archery rest where that arrow sits it's very controversial this is how geeky archery is it's very controversial should you have some fine mesh that sort of cradles the arrow and that fletchings will pass through that fine mesh possibly knocking down how many feet per second I p35 scientific I don't do that so will be more so will be real conservative and say three three feet a second it's pretty probably knocks off more than that but some people like because of its simplicity there it is that's a whisper biscuit I know the fletchings will pass through those fine fibers slow it down a little bit but not too much that's literally like training wheels for your arrow what John Dudley believes in he's like this crazy drop away type thing where they have an arrow rest it drops down he makes his own arrow rest yep knock on air arrest this follows its it is the knock on elevate it's a shit yes it's uh as a subject I want to talk to you about talk to you about this ever oh so a bunch of my US team members are gonna shoot me in the face for talking about this but guys in the face yeah literally in the face because one thing that was an ongoing thing for when I was on the US team we there was a thing that went on about how long we could go at a tournament before we talked about this particular person so during my time on the teams we actually had a person that was she claimed to have a medical disorder or she didn't actually claim to have it but supposedly it happens but she claimed to have a disorder where she had attachment to items this girl that was on my team actually ended up marrying the Eiffel Tower I serious I'm not kidding she wouldn't she had an attachment to yes she actually things filed some claims against supposedly filed some claims against a boat company that this boat company actually had a rubber laminate on the limbs of the Beau and Mary's Eiffel Tower is that her Wow she man Harris's famous monument minibuses with you her aiya oh my god she's a former soldier who lives in San Francisco she has been in love with objects before perfect her first infatuation was with Lance a bow that helped her become a world-class archer she is fond of the Berlin Wall and she claims to have have a physical relationship with a piece of fence she keeps in her bedroom what in the fuck what are we doing what are we doing people we can't we can't do this we've gotten too crazy we gotta pull back we gotta pull back here's the thing marry a fucking bridges pitch married a bridge she married a Brooklyn was she married the Eiffel Tower this bitch is marrying a bridge though kissing she's kissing bridges what what the fuck did she just say baby love for the public object crank that up I want to hear this crazy lady I feel very very blessed to have a piece my sweet Golden Gate Bridge oh Jesus stop I give up the bridge Hey now meanwhile wait wait in the middle of all this there's a lot of people like me that have shot tens and tens of tens of thousands of arrows trying to win a medal for the country right but that's different you Jason accomplishment you know if ya bridge yeah ladies try to fuck meanwhile she's on our team bus she literally she slept with her beau one night at a at an event and then got an infection from two silico on the limbs and the rest of the team had to deal with this problem when you say infection I don't know where the infection was but I'm the man Oh Oh know what I had on I'm a stiff away from him like listen but hey how good was she hasn't Jamie this he's actually like son of a bitch how good was she has an archer she must've been very good she's on a team right oh just putting a hat on the bow not a good sign actually look like potholder she must have been like a world-class Archer right don't do it don't do it to me John does I would say decent good Archer danger decent yeah good here's here's the thing okay so she married the Eiffel Tower mmm how'd that work out I think she's still married to it French people were pissed this is true this is a hundred percent true French people are pissed yeah because American just goes over there gets his fiancee visa marries a tower right so now we got a dual citizenship meanwhile she's got this thing for the Berlin Wall yeah okay well the Berlin Wall to flirt first of all so Berlin Wall there's always like being real sweet and giving you this extra long hugs the Berlin Wall fuck I didn't ask for it Jamie can of course she's she's in love with the Berlin waffles God how about she's married question for you she's married to Eiffel though so here's the deal listen to this don't want Joe to listen to this I just randomly picked a spot her last name is Eiffel though she literally took the legal name and her name is her name originally was Iowa Bree and I had to travel with her but now it's Iowa aiyah Eiffel Jamie I have to send you something that someone sent me today that I sent to Brian Cowen I'm going to send you it in two seconds it's the thing about France moves to see just you could probably google it France moves it's on NPR so legit France moves to make fifteen the lead legal age of consent for sex and it's because a bunch of dudes got in trouble for having sex with 11 year-olds what yeah we were talking about used to make it of age 15 the legal age of consent for sex like whoa there's a there's parts of the world that are just not where we are right now nope they're just not if you don't look at that like you got a who's saying this who's saying 50 quickly what 15 for what an 80 year old and 80 year old can fuck a 15 year olds that was you said I'll kill you I will fucking kill you yeah your ancestors violence coercion threat or surprise is not proven sexual intercourse with a minor even one under 15 is considered and I don't know what that means which is an infraction and not a crime it says intent attention sexual which is an infraction and not a crime I will come on I will put a trypan right through that guy's face yeah this has even blamed this is a correction necessary you have a cultural issue that's a cultural issue correction necessary no you think can't fuck ten year olds if anyone has a problem with with guys that are I guess but it's hunters like idiots like this that's terrifying that is that's terrible but I think verifying I think this is what happens with people man I think people get caught up in whatever the other people around them are doing and this is weird mob mentality maybe that's how what's the craziest thing I've seen as long I mean that's ridiculous it's today 2018 March 2018 while we're talking this is on the news as of happening right now in Europe they go well all right let's make you to make it illegal to fuck 14 year olds like what you don't that already on the books you could fuck a nine-year-old over there right how old they have to be is there an age limit at all or is it just oh you fucked a baby Bonjour Bonjour sorry merci that maybe it should make your stomach turn it does but here's the thing if you pay attention to history or if you read anything about the atrocities that why don't we learn history yes we have learned a little at what point we're just not all better than we were a hundred years ago better than we were 200 years ago but in the past it was like really commonplace I mean if you mean if you read anything about Socrates or anything about Plato like that time of the world like men having sex with children and little boys and stuff was like extremely common extremely common what yeah yeah and parts of the world men having sex with boys was extremely common for humans even in like what we would consider like classical cultural culture you know intelligent civilizations like the ancient Romans the ancient Greeks that like was a normal part of life it's really weird you know we'd want to deny that but there's undeniable proof that that's a fact that it was way more common in those ancient cultures than it is today like what is that like how did that happen like why did people allow that like why did that take place I don't know I think there's you forget I think some dads need to step up and beat some ass okay in 2005 the Cour de Cassation Frances highest Criminal Court stipulated that coercion is presumed for children at a very young age in quotes that's an outrageously blurry formulation that in practice has largely been applied to children under six what this leaves children above sex above six years old six potentially considered not raped when violence cannot be established it also allows the state of paralyzed shock experienced by many victims and all the more so children to equal consent that's terrifying let is wrote this Vikings barbarians those are barbarians is it this is this is ancient European barbarian law that's in place for thousands of years and they never caught up they never refix tit you got to fix that this is crazy you have the internet fix that that's crazy you could have sex with someone under it fucking nine or six or whatever the fuck it was that's nuts yeah that's this isn't repulsive this isn't 16 - this is 2018 yeah this is not the time for that that it's amazing that this still exists that's amazing in a European civilised it like really exalted culture like France it's Lance it's weird that they fight so passionately about some things but then they have something so stupid I think they're they're just freer in a lot of ways which is bad and good at the same time it's bad in that regard of taking care of children I'm like like fucking with children's heads sexually whether you just dooming them to this life of weirdness and you're making it legal so there's no legal recourse some guy who got fucked by some old dude when he was six that's crazy and that's real luckily I don't know anyone that know told me about that I'm sure it's happening though if that's the law how could how the fuck is that the law how's that the law I am saying is good to be right down we started this podcast literally in haunted houses and tell ya I've come full circle - it's a problem - this craft it's a problem and also the gift it is it's both things are our guide when Andy and I went to France he was an awesome about story because that's an amazing story he wasn't guys went to the French Alps on this bowhunting unsuccessful bow hunting trip for tar and even though it was on it was a fucking awesome it was success without necessarily harvest so what was a beautiful experience bro yeah right it was awesome we actually went there and I think kill cliff has a doc a little short film on it yeah called I think it's called high ground but Andy and I and II got into bow hunting because of you you spurn interest to shooting a bow and then actually you text me one time and said hey is it cool if I give you a friend of Mines number two I want him to learn an archery a little bit better and so I said yeah of course and actually you and I had met Andy and Vegas even though we don't totally remember most of it so I said yeah of course and then and and I become became friends and then we went to France and then we went on this epic hard-hard high-altitude hunt I was actually introduced to Andy by my friend Tate Fletcher take Fletcher knows him from the CrossFit world because Andy was uh he was in somehow or another responsible for something in the cross with something something important in the CrossFit world some sort of liaison something I think Andy was there I don't really know because I haven't asked him about that part but I know that he has background in it I think he was there kind of towards the beginning of it mmm I didn't know that's how Tait yeah that's how I met Andy I met Andy through tape just a crazy take knew him cuz Tate's big in the CrossFit world I saw Tate actually was following me on a post that I made and I was like this is such a small world he's a great dude it really is love that guy yeah he's awesome it really is he's the caveman coffee guy he's one of the owners of Casey Keith Jardine yeah tape just so you know lacy Maki all those are beautifully Mexico are for nitrous deadly for a normal-sized person luckier goddamn giant you'd be dead well you wouldn't be able to shut the fuck up if you like you know Duncan Trussell sighs do you bounce it off the walls right now how big is Duncan buck-fifty maybe what he's about buck 50 fat again seriously yeah he looks bigger than that no he's uh maybe an inch taller than me I think he's five nine and I think he's more slender Wow you know camera is powerful give a look at people and go hmm how much does that go away can I carry him how far can I carry do you think that when you saw me I said this fucking dude if he blacks out we better have an ambulance I can get up to him I'm not carrying its big ass you would if it meant something I had to it's a real what's the heaviest load you've ever carried on your back like when you if you've been like packing out an animal if you had a guess hmm definitely moose yeah I have a whole quarter I think had a quarter in a head how much that I don't know you have to have someone help you get it on get it up there to where you can get weight you know get that weight over the top of your legs dude a moose quarter is fucking heavy yeah I had I shot a young moose it was not a very big Morse it was a fork forked moose Mars um yeah I was a young a young in in British Columbia with powerful benobram yeah and my column you guys were right where I bear hunt yeah that's why when I met Ben your Annelle well yeah exactly which is right south of where I am where I was we had to take a picture of me carrying that quarter on my shoulders over and zagging yeah pintos heavy I didn't have to walk with it though I just had to carry it like how long did you have to carry a moose shoulder on your on your back how hard you scrap well how far how far did you pack it out three four hundred yards us on that so you know um Remmy Warren ruined his body carrying a moose out to leave it I think he said it took several days of going back and forth many many miles in and so they go miles in grab like a hundred pounds of moose meat a moose by the way he you might have 700 pounds of meat if you bone it out you have seven trips you know however many people you have you have seven individual packages of hundred pounds of meat you got to get out yeah through miles and miles and miles of dead falls and cliffy rocky fucking you might get cliffed out you might take a wrong path yeah hey CrossFit what is a 18.3 how about throw 200 pounds on your back and literally go from one end of your town to the next yeah when Remy was telling me about it I was like that that sounds great but like what incredible mental fortitude this guy had incredible mental fortitude that he figured out how to get through all the things who said fuck that meat I'll leave it back there some coyotes lead it who cares it's not going to waste I'm not going back it's not worth it you know he went back oh yeah and over and over again I think I want to say it was three or four days I'm packing out this moose yeah I bet that's the that's the real Western hunting that people don't understand they don't understand this this is not Elmer Fudd with an orange jacket shoot net deer you know hates animals this is not that this is some crazy physical endeavor that's highly difficult you know other one other one what drive in today it's two inches telegrams of caffeine you've had more honestly thousand milligrams caffeine perfect I'm on par that right there is why hunters are willing to to argue with people that slam hunting and say that we're just killers because if you had to put 800 packs of your ribeye steak on your back and walk it five miles home would you feel more passionate about it well that would be ridiculous I'm still owes just do eight trips Jesus Christ but it's straight hundred pounds in your back seems excessive but it's true I mean if you had do you ever move it enough that's not even enough I don't I don't think to really complete the cycle I think you'd have to be there you either have to be the one who pulls the trigger or you have to be there when it happens you have to see what's the difference between the living animal and dead animal yes if you don't then you're you're formulating your entire picture of the world based on information that you're only getting from a video right it's like we're talking about the difference between watching porn and having sex it's really similar the difference between understanding this in terms of like watching on a video and actually being there like oh this is what it looks like when a cow dies this is what it looks like they hang it by its ankles and gut it this is how I feel about this now I had one feeling about this before when I was nicely insulated by all the pride it's got a nice white styrofoam little tray with saran wrap and a nice piece of rib eye oh look at that I'm gonna get the fucking briquettes out there and start the grill whoa you get all excited but it's not their fault it's just we are weird even through our entire developmental process we're shielded through one of the most important parts of life whereas your food come from it should be like one of the number one things you think of where's your family are they safe where's your food come from those are question number one in question number two yeah right well it's a lot like that with the job too I mean we've had people that have come to work for us or like okay this is what working for this business is gonna be like and then they come and they realize whoa this is completely different whereas I've been the same I've I've worked for companies that I've really really liked and I go there and then I realize holy cow this is a whole different thing yeah versus what it really really is so it gets tough I mean you know it's hard to and that's why you can't really judge anyone because unless you've been in those shoes it's not really fair to build an assessment easy now my first one is my first bro relax no you're absolutely right there's nothing wrong with letting someone know that doing something wrong that's negatively affecting others yep that's that's that's a good thing but there's a there's a bigger issue that's like that when people are like constantly going after other people and attacking in the most vicious way most likely it's because they're trying to divert attention from from how they are or or that it could come back at them you know just like a weird dance that people do with liking and disliking other people has Sun always healthy you know and I've been studying this for the longest time and I still don't understand it totally I have my vague assessments of how it all is sort of falling into place but I don't know totally how it's working but I know that's the people that are the most pleasant to be around are the people that are both the most friendly the most understanding the most objective and the most just just loving just nice people you know and the friends that we all have that we know that it like that those are the fun people that be around you know you're gonna have a good time yeah every time I see you I know I'm gonna have a good time we never have a bad time we have fun times oh yeah we definitely do isn't that a nice thing like how come that can't be replicated everywhere I wish it could I totally wish it could I feel like I feel like people that haven't experienced hardship don't appreciate the good times as much and I feel like for me anyway the fact that I've experienced times where I've really struggled and I've had to either up my game or cook or decide to quit which you know that's your choice is either either you step up and you work hard enough to where you achieve it and then at that point you really really appreciate it which is something that I experienced when you talk to me about kettlebells I thought okay well I'm not good at this so either I'm not gonna be able to relate to Joe or I'm gonna learn to do it right and I ended up going down to Austin because I'm I wanted to experience it a little bit more to where I can appreciate okay if Joe's do a windmill with a freaking big foot what is this what is this real like it looks easy when I watch the YouTube video but then when I grab a freaking chimp and do it and I'm struggling to do it without having my shoulder hit me in the side of the face and then I'm thinking okay Joe's doing this now with a Bigfoot I think it's like ninety nine ninety I don't know somewhere in the night let's just say it's a 90 pound 90 pound kettlebell you got to realize that I started out with the 35 pound one you know and I struggled with it and then but but it's also I've been doing flexibility exercises since I was a kid so windmills not as difficult for me as a lot of other people it was actually pretty easy for me to pick up because my body is used to whipping like everything's kicking alright all that kicking and shit kicking is a lot of is with your hips a lot of is with your waist and your hips when you learn how to like really throw power into things that's where it all comes from so the windmill that's like a natural movement of that like those muscles were already conditioned and strengthened I feel like I'm a damn totally inadequate when I look at you I had to I do I mean I work out every day but my physique I feel like a lot of people look at my physique from a distance and I think oh that guy is in really good shape but then like I look at you and sometimes your abdomen protrudes a little bit and then I've been in rooms from Joe takes his shirt off and he's like a frickin he's jacked don't let him fool you I work out yeah he works out I trying to fool people yeah he has a little bit of an abdomen that goes out further than this packs it's its own I can't even believe you have that skin because your six-pack sticks out further than your PEC deck verse this is my PEC deck well I'm gonna show you some of the shit that I do out here we'll do a little working out out here but one of the things that I've really gotten into is there's like a circuit a glute-ham machine that does your lower back and then I do these elevated situps and then a decompression machine or no no it's like no that's that's the third one that's the reverse hyper that's the third one but I do this whole series of things that I'm doing for abs it's tremendous for abs and back and I like the sturdiness of your core yeah I just I feel like if I just do these on a regular basis it makes it just a giant difference in how my body moves and how stable I feel I feel like that's why you're good with archery is because your core so solid I think it's a really really good foundation another foundation is those Club bells I'm really yes club bells I do a little shield cast with those clubs there's something about when you do that when you're controlling like a 25 pound Club doesn't seem like a lot of weight but if you could slowly control that when you get a bow in your hand you're trying to level that bow it's like you're you have more control of your body you have better understanding of you know the all the the various speeds that your muscles can move at where you could just slow it down slow it down there it is there it is there it is and I feel like the more you strengthen those muscles particularly stabilizing muscles of the shoulders with like reverse kettlebells you know kettle upside-down kettle bells where the bottoms I love those those are great because those are even a lightweight you just do it slow and it's while wiggling do those big-time hammer curls - deltoids fault military shoulder press Domino with a vertical kettlebell and then but don't sleep on those windmills - because it's the same thing it's all shoulder stability action flexibility yeah being able to go to the floor is a big big aspect it's huge it's huge and it's just I feel like if as long as you don't overdo it I don't think there's any danger of injuring yourself I think if you do it correctly it's actually the opposite I think it strengthens everything strengthens the whole chain from your arms to your shoulders to your core to your hips to your legs the whole thing gets strengthened because everything has to move you know I want to on an academy I think last summer Sharon and I were down there for actually I think it was September we down there for the hurricane Harvey we were down there we raised some newer you're feeding people and yeah - yeah yeah we raise money cool of you that's very cool part of that was because of the house fire I mean obviously when I was someone who lost everything so I understand where that comes from so when the I was actually on a hunt with Andy up in Alberta when the hurricane happened and I was completely disconnected from the news I got a text from Sharon that just said you won't believe what's happening down in Houston so we ended up coming in and I looked it up with Wi-Fi while we were in town and then I showed Annie and I said man this is terrible what's happening down in Texas so he's like I wish we could do something I said well I'm gonna so I just I ended up going live and offering to auction off my boat during a live feed and we ended up raising thankfully there were three bidders I don't know if I can announce who they were but there were three bidders that bid about 15 grand I think it was I think it was 20 you think it was about 22 hundred bucks or twenty two thousand and then we had one person that offered to match the other two so it ended up getting to be thirty thousand that we raised went down to Houston and then crispy who was doing a lot of a lot of really cool things for getting supplies into the Houston area krispies the hunting boot company know crispy that's his Instagram I don't know as a dude yeah the guy said crispy I thought you meant crispy boot no so we we ended up raising a bunch of money got it down there went down you sell a lot of people to man yep I watched a lot of those Instagram posts very very cool crispy and archery country filled a full trailer full of supplies Sharon and I flew down to Houston or well first we flew to Austin then we drove to Houston and went down to a church where we did where we ended up feeding a lot of people and then delivering all these supplies that we raised with the money that we got from auctioning off this bow which I know what it's like to lose everything so I was pretty adamant about it that's awesome yeah it was it was dynamite super rewarding feeling I don't know where I'm going with that dumb listen man there's a good story it's just cool and I remember watching it online on my bow that's badass you know and I know how sits here you are about that stuff too you know I think that's a great great expression you know great thing to do you have the same thing for Vegas I mean you're passionate about certain things and you know we've we've had a lot of doors open for us from different communities Texas was a big one for me because I worked for an archery company for many years and Texas was one of my States as a sales rep did that's one of the few places I'd live if I didn't live in California there's a few places I live I was in LA I think in Northern California I think of like San Diego elec San Diego Colorado Montana yeah once I get out of caught once again out of California then on my Colorado Montana I sexist Texas is in the mix baby because I like Texans man I'd like I just there's a stereotype about the worst Texans but they're not the best Texans so you never met the best Texans the best Texans are like oh you're like some cool combination of smart and old-school you know you're a cool combination of like hip and and progressive and oh you want a tiger and also you have gun you want a tiger yeah oh you see my bit remember that bit you saw that little bit that I used to do about Texas it's legit though it is legit Texas has more tigers in captivity than all of the wild of the world more in Texas and my joke was like one dude was like going through the regulations like she I don't know you get it order it up dude order it up and that his neighbor found out he goes ma didn't know you get Tigers neighbors got two got Tigers he's like man about ain't about to let this faggot out Tiger Mika and he opened up Tiger world fuckin ridiculous joke that's based on a true fact that there's more tigers in captivity in Texas than anywhere in the world but Texas the thing is Texas of 2018 is not Texas of even 2008 and definitely not Texas of 1990 way it's better and smarter and it's a it's a good place to be men Texas is a good place to be it's one of my favorite spots it is cool I love it there man I like the people there's sort of it's a weird combination the country it's a kind I think it is I think it is - it's a completely different I mean it everything about it's different isn't it true well I always explained it on stage about Bucky's we're taking people that are never in the Bucky's which I went to the first Bucky's on that he on when I took supplies down to Houston for the hurricane that was my first time at a Bucky's and I thought is this a freakin Costco but with fuel the way I described it on stage I always said this is like if you were in the middle of a full-on cocaine binge well someone came up to you and said dude I want you to make me the ultimate gas station with hundreds of pumps like you can't believe how many pumps there are it doesn't make any sense it's like a goddamn field of pumps it doesn't make any sense and then you go into this building it is a fucking warehouse filled with pickled alligator dicks different kinds of jelly beans and Chuck Norris action jeans and camouflage and Yeti coolers and smokers you're like what the fuck is this and it's huge I mean it's like a fucking goddamn football field-sized room filled with jelly beans different kinds of camo and Realtree there's a Bucky's right there you can see that's a mild Bucky's that that's a bug that's on the edge of the fucking Wyoming or some shit Chuck Norris chief there's so many pumps it doesn't make any sense look at that right there how many pumps is that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 10 20 21 22 and double it might be right and there's two on each one so it literally might be 200 fucking pumps that's crazy why doesn't Chuck Norris make jeans series two awesome he used to he did I sew on a pair of pumps what let's see these I don't have any time on these two lace up in the front they did yeah they laced up in the front let you do sidekicks it has a gusset looks like Chris urlan they had a gusset in the crotch area I like that the lace up in the front side might be lying that might be I wouldn't need again a little longer inseam therefore that that cowboy be kicked well back in the day they didn't understand about barbell jeans they didn't have that time the fabric technology I do have a pretty good kick distance which I'll have you ever seen mine I'm sure it's very long it is we'll make a video out later okay the top of a doorway oh look at that no dress shirt son of a B yeah that's gentleman right there will always have my respect him and Bruce Lee are the reason why I got into martial arts 100% today watch it Chuck Norris movies when I was a kid one of my proudest moments of my life was in Chuck Norris knew who I was I went into him in a kickboxing event in New Jersey like way back in the day and he gave me this big hug it was one of his events that he had he had a World comment lease he gave me a big hug I was like holy shit Chuck Norris knows who I am damn right he couldn't have been happier wonder your unbreakable beaker that was beaming and then later I took a picture of me and Tate Tate again there was a award show that they did for an old school karate master and Chuck Norris was there and a bunch of other old school American black belt karate guys and they're telling these awesome old-school karate stores and they asked me to be there and speak a little bit and I would it I mean I did anything for Chuck Norris like no bullshit go corney's you want for watches Chuck Norris jeans he changed my life for real if it wasn't for Chuck Norris movies who knows I might not have forgotten the martial arts I've watched him in like lone wolf McQuade and shit it was like goddamn that might be the coolest guy that's ever lived did you laugh the other night in Vegas when we were talking about what my wife Sharon's name was supposed to be coming up with names people know like her what she was so yeah Debra no well that was the fake name he gave the fake name my wife's name her dad actually wanted a name right Bruce Lee that was a crazy story of all time I forgot about that Sharon baby making a rude if you knew if you knew Sharon you would laugh at this but her dad was in the nunchuks and all kinds of sorts and my wife when my wife was born they didn't know what she was gonna be so they had he really wanted her name to be Bruce Lee but if he knew Sharon you knew you know she is far from Bruce Lee do we have any more alpha brain we need I made a deal with my wife I said I'm not uh I'm not naming the kids oh my god just have veto power it's not fair I go I just it's like that was a good story too they grew in your body I'm like I'm not I'm

as you don't call them fucking applesauce or something crazy this is my kid pixie you're not gonna torture them with your wacky bullshit but pixie yeah I mean I just gave my suggestions my feelings but I was like there's no way it's fair for me to name the kid you know actually you know she did have some goofy ass name for dudes and I might have had to put the fucking stand on I know how hard it is for guys like a guy like John or a guy like Joe that's those are good names they're solid solid there is he can't fuck you or you would you fucking name John like what are you talking about I had a suit like a fool I had a CB and junior high and I actually I've always loved frogs I know you have a frog tattooing okay Jamie Google a pixie frog what's a pixie frog so the real thing I used to have

know but you just frog not just a pixie fragra fixie frog eating a fucking rat with its poking out the camera I would have to buy mice to feed my to Pete feed my pixie frog because he ate mice to look at the size of that go back to that one please look at the size of its body with the full Mouse in his body he just bands like a water balloon that's crazy that's such a crazy I always like frogs and I thought they were really cool especially pixie frogs they were super aggressive they would eat something up to their size holy Sh like you could put a mouse in their cage the same size as them and they would tackle it as crazy make it have you never seen them it's a little tiny monster right oh my god we go all the way up Jim oh my god take that picture and send it to me big picture that says me that might be the greatest picture I've ever seen in my life Handel was pixie and I didn't know that pixie wasn't cool until someone else like addressed me on it but I always liked a trick it's like the most demonic ruthless thing how many animals eat an animal their size not a lot that sucker did I guess mine was the size of a dinner plate unless that kid is a pixie himself no we're looking at my man my leg was this big that little bit slow he's about seven years old this is an African bullfrog what it is that's what it's a pixie this is how big my frog was we're holding Jon Dudley's holding us a typical ice tray that you would get in a hotel room I would call them ice buckets brother rabbit oh my God look at the size of that rabbit might be a small girl no it's a big rabbit I could tell by its feet go to it doesn't look right gigantism look at them all oh yeah there's another one eating a rat yeah they're monsters I had a lot of videos of mine just smoked and mice that's crazy to think that it could literally eat something the same size they were so there's a full fucking Python they found in Florida in the Everglades that ate a deer a hundred and ten percent and guess what have you assholes done you fucking let skynyrd lovin muscle car driving dip shits people pythons and a fucking terrarium in your bedroom with motley crue posters on the wall and you do acid decide that they go to your yard now they're eating deer that are 111 pounds they're fucking huge man look at that they're oh Jesus Christ oh my god it's so big this thing is so big this guy's holding on to it is that a biologist that's got it he's holding on to the mouth and the head controlling the body and inside of it is this enormous lump that is apparently a deer that's bigger than its whole body in terms of his body weight if you ever see the one where one died because it was trying to eat an alligator you ever see that one I think so dude this is how gangster pythons are they arguing alligators anything that can unlock its jaw is pretty gangster dude they fuck with alligators they look at an alligator in the Gobi yeah I'm gonna just try to eat you I saw I actually went to a comedy skit at Riviera remember we were talking about that look at this thing dude I don't interrupt a bit but go to the upper left upper left corner you get the best example this is what happened it died because the alligator blew out the side of his asshole let's try to eat this thing I mean this literally happened it literally swallowed up this fucking whole alligator face-first and the alligator backed its way out of its asshole and they both died in the Everglades but this fucking snake is so big it's trying to eat an alligator that's bigger than it yeah it doesn't care these crazy fucks have let these things loose in the United States of America it's simple math that that comic that we saw at Riviera I saw in the late 90s which I think you were there at that time yeah we're talking about that's kind of crazy but he here Jamie cutting a person out of a snake wonderful good times a perfect time India to some places John Dudley fucking narrowly escaped my train set on my train oh my god it is a fucking mistake this is what you need to learn folks just because you watch nature doesn't mean you know nature just like if you watch porn you're not getting laid it's the same thing if you take anything from this podcast take that nature's like where you go yeah will you go we're talking about BC and you you go bear hunting tell the people how crazy it is up there you're in a forest filled with monsters oh yeah well they don't they don't watch the news it's all about they can't can't I eat you yeah well pretty much like this my mouth is this big you're this big I think you can fit in it yeah that's as simple as it gets that comic at Riviere that time who was it do we don't know I wish I knew because it was actually good it was a really good bid he said yeah he he pretty much talked about the fact that you know he's so sick of people getting complaining about how fat they get because he said you know literally it's simple math people your mouth is this big your buttholes this big at some point there's a bottleneck and he just said he said between your mouth and your in your asshole it wasn't it wasn't Damai rare well I don't know you know so long ago I mean it was 20 years ago at most that sounds like something dumb I rarely yeah he just said listen it's simple Matt your mouth is this big but holds this big yeah why are you complaining about being fat well that's the real concept behind that 16 hour fasting you know Eddie Bravo 16 I was doing 14 for a while but Eddie said that it's 16 is really where all the benefits happens all right I'll give it a try so I tried 16 and I see it there's definitely something to it there's more alertness I processed food better I think giving your body a smaller window to process food is really wise I think it it also it aids you because it gives you discipline Geneva some little discipline it's just a baby baby amount of discipline but it's no it's a lot it's not it's not really to me and you it's not but to some people that is right seriously but it's all relative but I'm just being honest with them if they just they need to get past that it's not really a lot but the benefits of it like how you feel when you finally have your first meal when you cross over the line like you feel better and your body works better and you have more energy that's a fact I've learned absorb it faster you and I both are big fasters I mean I fast I normally eat last maybe about seven o'clock at night and then I normally eating in about 10:00 or so in the morning so I mean it's it's quite a bit of time and when I eat I legitimately feel like my I can feel my body absorbing everything that I'm consuming right like it's processed everything else that's not supposed to be that's really what fat is all about right fat is all about you just keep stockpiling even though your body hasn't processed is like I don't know where to put it over here your body's like stacking up fat all over your body and study utilizing it for a few years it's not burning off enough calories yeah you know that is that's what this whole fasting thing sort of normalizes for me at least it just gives you this opportunity where your body says let's just digest everything we got here let's just do this and then when those two Blakes up in the morning wouldn't be burning fats this is the way to go and then you feel good you have more energy bodies using ketones especially if you're like someone like myself that I'm not eating a lot of bread if I eat bread once every two or three weeks it's a big deal but you pasta once every two or three weeks it's a big deal do you feel like dogshit wouldn't do no no but I don't go crazy I don't go crazy if I don't go crazy I don't feel bad but if I do go crazy if I eat like a big piece of chocolate cake and some ice cream I feel it way more now way more now yeah I think you're more in tune if you're if you're conscious about it I think you have a better understanding of what it actually does to you that's the problem with people that are in the lifestyle of doing every single day is they don't really realize what it's doing to them I think there's that but I think there's also obviously a tolerance that you develop just like people develop a tolerance for an alcohol people develop a tolerance for weed people definitely I think develop tolerance for sugar and when I don't have it then I feel the full brunt of sugar and it's like I remember I took my family to get cheese burgers and milkshakes and I had a big-ass fucking vanilla milkshake and it was so good oh my god I was drinking this big-ass like 20 ounce vanilla milkshake and I was eating this cheeseburger and I hit the wall so hard after was over I had to sit down like a bug what kind of bitch in my that I'm get taken out I get like hamstrung by a cheeseburger and a milkshake but it was just clearly that I've been eating clean for so long my body had no idea what to do with that giant dump of sugar mmm look how much sugar do you think is in 20 ounces or 18 I don't know how much it was like one of those you know those Sunday drink things they give you it works yeah gasps oh God glass filled with ice cream milkshake today I was in the airport in Des Moines and I got a coffee hundred grams 20 ounce chocalate shake nutrition information how many favorite how many tablespoons is that 100 how many tablespoons it's so crowded in Des Moines Airport this morning I got a coffee and a guy behind me got a coffee he was like I think he was a baggage handler for one of the airlines I literally came up and I poured nothing but half-and-half in my coffee I'm a big I actually feel like I thrive off fat now right because that's what my body wants he unscrewed the top of a jar of meth No yeah pretty much he unscrewed the top off the sugar and he started I was actually like dude can you do that again so I can video this he unscrewed the top off the sugar and started pouring in his coffee and he poured and I was like oh my god is that a lot and then he kept going and kept going and kept going and then he tipped the thing down put the top back on the sugar and then poured in freaking creamer and I was well I was sitting there like do dude that is that's rich it's literally like two or three times what you're saying and the problem is this guy that was half my size needed that to feel like he could get the day going that's a big his job so bad they just wanted to go into a diabetic coma fucking middle of the work floor he's like look fuck this insulin I'm just eating about a half a pound of sugar let's do this okay I love it got myself wet what's that no it's okay it's just my pants it's just this nothing little jeans nothing my barbell jeans are wet look embarrassment this is for your own good ladies and gentlemen it's for comedy it is okay no computer how many tablespoons of sugar is in a hundred grams question when I think of a hundred grams I'm thinking like a baseball of sugar that's what I think it's a lot a major league baseball of sugar does that make sense yeah for sure is that legit can I see like a physical representation of a hundred grams of sugar 1tbsp equals twelve grams that's so crazy what does that look like it's not quite a baseball it's a baseball it's a baseball huh eight and a half eight and a half is bigger than a golf ball that's I'm just being conservative how many golf balls one Kiwi two three I bet it's two golf balls Jamie whoa that's a lot you snorted that you'd be on cloud nine seconds look at that quarter that's Chris to get proportion that's crazy holy nuggets that's all no check no wonder why this cups Joe that's dead that's comparison there's a hundred grams right here I think it's comparing Oh hundred grams okay two cups it's one cup but look at the size the hundred grams that's nuts that's so much sugar and that's what's in a milkshake I gotta go to the doctor this happened years ago but I still have to go to the doctor today because of it let's wrap this up yippee again it's already four o'clock let's shoot some arrows if you're interested in high level archery instruction and information knock-on
