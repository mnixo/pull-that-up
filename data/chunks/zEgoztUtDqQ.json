trained by Joe Rogan podcast by night all day people get crazy you know people get crazy look look Ronny's people go crazy too everybody gets crazy people get crazy like why did Rhonda charge after okay what why did she try to stand with with Holly like that and charge after that's not the right attempt right but you know what she did a page what so Paige was also at that VIP party and Paige and i'm spoke were friendly don't know her that well but anyway she felt the need she came out to shake me she me sure she's I have to tell you this experience I had with Rhonda I'm like oh what and she's like well we're at a Reebok deal just you know recently and she she's like we were at a shoot and she like I was trying to find her so we could get a picture and the Reebok people were like don't ask Rhonda for a picture she's like why she's like just don't do just stay away from Rhonda don't ask her for a picture she's like okay and I guess Rhonda came later that day and like seeked her out and just like cussed her out like they've never really had a conversation either she's like I don't know Rhonda like you know other than hi bye that's it like I guess she came up Rhonda came up was like fuck you you Fairweather bitch how dare you cross me ball watch that cross you what are you talking about and she's like you congratulated Holly home for beating me so fuck you you fucking Fairweather 115-pound like I was just like went off on page and page kami told me and I was like honey welcome to my world she's like oh my god she's like I'm glad that I saw this side of her so I know you know I'm like well and she's like you know because I didn't understand she's like I told her on it like I'm sorry if that offended you but you don't allowed to congratulate whoever I want and she's like because you know I congratulate a rose Nami Eunice when she beat me I was like you know congratulations you want my ass that was a badass performance and she's like you know I just simply told Holly congratulations once when like wasn't anything you know anti Rhonda but Rhonda has just ripped her new one Wow but you have to be on Team Rhonda for life yeah I guess I've never been on Team Rhonda so I'm good all or not then just see what she's evolved right that's the best I think I've seen her look so I have to assume like she's gonna be better than that even do you have goals as far as like what you want to do with the title how long do you want to hold it do you have any thoughts in mind of like must be deponents like is getting Rhonda back in the Octagon yeah that's important I need that like that has to happen that's very important to me and I have Amanda ahead of me I do not want to look faster because I think that would be a huge mistake it's not one that I want to make as a veteran in my career that would be a rookie move but you know in the back of my mind of course like the fight with Ronda is something I want to happen and you don't know when it will happen it could be anticipated for November I've heard that be tossed around in the EOC that you she's planning on coming back and maybe it might be Madison Square Garden that would be great I want to focus on that I want to focus on Amanda but I know in the back of my mind and I want I want that fight like I want that to happen I think it's so important to me in my career to go and beat Ronda and prove everyone else like I've been an underdog in most of my fights I've been the person that people have always counted out in my entire career my entire life most people are telling me you can't you couldn't you shouldn't you wouldn't and I'm you know that's I'm fine with that I'm perfectly fine with that I am at the best point of my career and Ronda is at the worst you know she's going through what I've already been through oh you know time and time again and I have built myself back up from that point time and time again I know that I can do that I'm confident in that Here I am standing the strongest that I've ever stood and I've already been through that I've already been had kicked and knocked out that happened to me before like I picked myself up but pull myself up by my bootstraps but one foot back in front of the other and worked got my Strike World title I lost it around to pick myself back up put one front or the other got back on the horse fought fought fought fought round again you see was devastated crushed thought my world was just falling down around me coming to an end got pick up we put one foot in for the other got back on the horse and now here I am the world champion you know I know that I'm tough I know that I have what it takes to beat Ronda many people don't believe that that's okay I've been in this position before many most people didn't think I was going to beat Holly most people in think Holly is gonna beat Ronda doesn't matter to me other people think it matters what I believe and what I know and um the question mark is what how is Rhonda going to come back from this I know what I've been hearing from Rhonda in the media and the press she's been a little quiet lately but before that it wasn't what I would have expected to hear from someone who really wants to come back and who's really really a fighter at the core she's a great athlete she's a great fighter she's accomplished a lot of things credit where credit's due you know I give her a round of applause for everything she's been able to accomplish well tell you what every time I've ever lost in my career I went bananas to get back in there ballistic I was like I have to like right now just like holly was like they're like when do you want to fight again she's like tomorrow i can'ts Misha now that's what you want to hear when someone has a devastating loss they want to get back in there right now and face that person right now or or someone else just get that loss of the record erase it when I lost the cat Zingano I freaked out I freaked out I called Shaun Shelby I was like get me another fight right now he's like your nose is him he'll I don't give a fuck I want to I want to fight I want it now I want to know when it's coming up like right now or I'm gonna freak out I don't know what to tell you but I'm gonna lose my shit if I don't have like a fight on the horizon lose it and then I hear Ronda like I'm gonna take a year off and I'm gonna you know I'm gonna do this I mean I'm like that just doesn't sound like someone who really wants this anymore and I think that fight might have broke her I could be wrong but I think something inside of her is different than it was before um maybe she's not broken but it's different cuz how much do you think a factor is how much of a factor do you think success is in the part in terms of she's doing movies she's she was the darling of all his late-night television shows and everybody wanted to hang out with her she's doing the these commercials with you know Seth Rogen on television like how much of a factor is at well she has security now she has job security outside the FCC she doesn't really need that anymore and I think maybe that's also something on her mind is like does she really want this because winning is awesome it's great it's easy it's like when you win everybody loves you everybody supports you everybody's there everybody's on your train when you lose fucking sucks it sucks and only the people that really love you are still really really there for you everyone else is just like now whatever the loser and then you have the social media you know white knights that come out and want to tell you what a you know piece of shit you are and how you're never going to accomplish anything and you'll never win another fight you guys will just quit and retire bla bla see those people and you have to make a choice you know and my choice has always been to do to to keep fighting you know to end it I just don't I don't recognize there's a lot of things I recognize in Ronda that I can I can recognize her greatness I can recognize you know her championship I can recognize things I don't identify with that I don't identify was sitting on that loss for a year I cannot understand it if it was me it would have eaten me alive inside and out tenet I couldn't have done it I couldn't be making a movie I couldn't be doing that I would it would just but did she I don't think she has a choice I think if you have movie contracts I think you have to fulfil them ah do you doesn't I don't know does Connor have to show up for but he's different but showing up for press conferences is one thing yeah but I don't think I think she could if she could have fought because they said they had anticipated for her to come back at UFC 200 they wanted that and they and and Dana said she could of but should she she could have but should she I think that could oven should she was because she had to do a movie for three months so like doing the movie for three months would have taken three months outside of her camp and you've done a movie before you know what it's like you're on the set all day it's 16-hour days it's long and grueling you don't have time to Train yeah but after a loss like that I think you really have to have enough time to actually focus and then on top of that to getting getting flatlined like that but you have to have a some time to recover to recover your head yeah absolutely I just don't know if a year that would I'm just saying that would crush me I wouldn't be able to do what she's doing right now right I wouldn't physically be able to like to deal with that for a year and if I had to I think it would eat me alive like I think I'd be so depressed and so I'm pretty sure it's eating her alive too yeah but how do you sit on it for a year then mmm how do you do that do what you got to do can't I couldn't well you know it's all speculation we only we don't know until she comes back and then but the other thing too is like she's like you know she had her you know her downs her her really really low which I empathize with I've been there um you know but then she said you know I was thinking about you know these all these negative thoughts and and then I looked up and she said this on my own show I looked up and I saw Travis Brown and I realized you know I've got to stick around to have his babies and I thought like what would have went through my mind is like I got to get back and get my title back I got to get back and like win a fight like it just seemed like her mindset is different than what I would expect a fighters mindset to be does that make sense at all like what I'm trying what I'm saying is like it didn't seem like her motivation was to to fight and win again it was there was other things now I'm not saying she's not going to come back and be great or come back and and fight not questioning that I'm questioning where her true motivation is coming from because I think while she was winning it was so awesome like she's like well yeah I want to keep doing this of course I want to keep I keep crushing girls I'm demolishing him I'm a star all these great things are coming now she already has that she's already making movie she already has millions of millions of dollars is her true motivation was it just you know keeping that undefeated streak because she talked about that so much you know I will retire undefeated and then she even said like I don't you know I'm questioning what am i doing now like you know now I'm not going to ever retire undefeated so what is my you know maybe I'm meant for this maybe meant she doesn't really know that was her identity was like to be undefeated in this sport so if that's not the goal anymore I just don't know like I feel like I sent something off I said something is not right in her mindset and I think she's going to come back and I think she's gonna fight and think she'll fight hard but I just don't know if she still has it after a brutal loss like that you know is she still hungry enough those are fighting words yeah is she hungry no that's my question but it's what you're doing right now is you're throwing up the bat-signal right yeah well that's how I feel hanging it down man I get a lot of shit because people like oh you know either snow I don't apologize for anything that I say unless I really say it's something that was that I didn't mean to say that was hurtful to someone and like I fucked up but honestly if it's my opinion is my opinion if you don't like it I'm not gonna apologize for my opinion no apology for anything that I you know that had to say about the way I feel about Rhonda the way I feel about any any of these situations you know so I've just I'm gonna be as transparent well I don't think you say anything disrespectful either and I don't think yeah anything you should I think as a champion and that's what you are you you're analyzing someone's mindset and you're totally entitled to that yeah and I have a lot of respect for Rhonda he's an athlete you know a lot my guys think you'll ever be friends after all said and done never I don't think so no no I think she thinks that I've done so many things and like I don't think she would ever I think she blames me for things that I didn't even do so what I mean how do you even get around that right you know like I heard when you guys did your interview she wasn't something like that I called a promotion and like tried to get crispy like um mess with him before like his fight or something that that I guess he I guess he was contracted to another promotion and he wasn't supposed to be while he was on the Ultimate Fighter and I guess that that Dana received a call and then they thought that I she thought that I like did that I'm like first of like first of all like I didn't even know he signed to another organization at all if he you know like if he was it didn't have even crossed my mind like I'm to like I said I'm too easygoing to even think of something like that and I'm not malicious by any means I have nothing against Chris peel but I think she thought that I tried to like mess with him like I called the promoter of whatever organization little small contract don't even know how I would have known that right how would you even know that how do you know but this is the same girl that ripped page four for congratulating Holly she has her way of thinking and she's going to hate me until the day she dies and I'm okay with that that's fine we don't need to be friends that's okay you know I'm perfectly fine with that all right yeah
