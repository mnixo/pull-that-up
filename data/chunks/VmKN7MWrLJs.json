hello bitches I'll talk to you when you're surviving animal food and plastic and then eat it and then poop it out and eat it later like I'm take the plastic off and eat it what Jesus Christ it seems like it could work that's a technique I've never thought I mean if you're gonna be like on your own for five days you can eat a bunch of food but wrap it up in plastic and then later poop it out then uncheck it out but then how would you get the nutrients from the food in the first place with your stomach a piece of plywood is this poop it out understand like it and then you poop it out like before you leave for your trip go don't go get stuff to market or something don't tell him stop can't can't tell a guy to eat his poop I'm saying like eat like a big meal before you're about to leave Josie would eat his own poop it's called Second Harvest in Native American say maybe take a bunch of like protein bars wrap them up in plastic eat it and then poop it out in a couple days then unwrap the plastic what kind of shit you think a fucking hole protein bar in lastik cans make it through your digestive tract I just like carry the bars in my backpack and just eat them three days that is later porous understanding of the human digestive tract ever exhibited on a podcast I was trying to figure out what you were saying I thought you're saying eating poop you're not talking about a little baggie of heroin that a drug mules that's what I was thinking make you survive you'll you'll get another hours worth of energy from that little heroin bag what about petite filets people get diverticulitis because they get a fucking watermelon seeds the frickin word diverticulitis is mayonnaise well Brock Lesnar went from the UFC serious operation when they remove 12 inches of his colon now found out about I looked into it and I thought it was just because of eating meat but Anthony Bourdain informed me that you can eat a seed like you get like a sunflower seeds or something stuck inside your tract your digestive tract and it starts an abscess and you get sick yeah you could you died from a fucking seed getting stuck he's like all kinds of stuff gets stuck in there so it's not necessarily just protein there's also contracted netting Anthony Bourdain is like a GI tract doctor now you can't eat a petite filet mignon shit out in the woods son that's all I'm saying you gotta have to have a better strategy than that I guess I was thinking survivor Island like trying to find a way to cheat you can't you can't just carry in your backpack yo you're pregnant if you had enough food for a day all the food backed up be your body what kind of calorie consumption are you thinking you have
