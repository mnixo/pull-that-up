the girag and experience cuz he can didn't does he elaborate any further than that I don't I don't think so I think he just leaves it that but still man sean connery gets away with that because he's handsome he's got that cool accent but imagine somebody out saying that Jude Law yeah it's just bad I mean ultimately Sean Connery is just hitting women he's from an old school era so it's kind of funny to hear ya that's why because of like Jude Law don't know why I'm saying Jude Law again but he has a proper accent he's a handsome guy if he wound up saying that an interview it would ruin his career yeah absolutely ruin his career like who's a famous movie star today who's like a good example like Ryan Reynolds I guess a handsome guy I'm not sure that is Ryan Seacrest imagine if Ryan Seacrest said that he would know he's gay she would know look I know what you're doing mm probably doesn't have time for sex okay this guy that's Ryan Reynolds this handsome bastard if he said that if Ryan Reynolds said that sometimes you need to smack a woman holy shit with the backlash be extraordinary salon.com would dedicate months and months of front page articles yeah but what about all the sites defending him none none none none to be a few of those buggin men's rights Sean Connery fan clubs fear those embarrassing men's rights sites where they write things like oh come on you know went too far you fucks you ruined the whole argument the whole argument is divorced laws the whole argument the whole argument is how many guys get fucked over finance it's so weird salon.com started attacking patton oswalt you know it's not salon.com okay it's a writer a writer decided that they were going to pick a hot-button topic that didn't necessarily jive or make sense but they felt like because patton oswalt was making fun of someone else's racism by showing like this it's actually very similar to what colbert is get in trouble for right except Patton Oswalt is a fucking like obvious comedian and in known as a pretty sensitive aware I like the idea that he would say something racist just for the joke like he was they knew what he was doing and they decided to go for it anyway and that's when he attacked them litter they should have he should have they're gross like there's something about their their articles too if you go to salon.com one of the things is almost every article starts with a question you know is you know is this the time to reconsider the the argument of who's funny or men or women question mark is this you know this is is this what's wrong with the right question mark you know like this it's it's weird they're they're like opinion pieces that represent this article it just is like it's it's amazingly this guess guess what chicken butt does anti-vegan shaming pitch in a preschool is that their salon article yeah hold on mr. show patriarchal hedge monkey in sketch show titles Tesla the man from Nantucket anti-transgender subtext and classic to the homeless salon articles you dummies you fucked with the wrong guy yeah you did he lit him up she's right man I mean I get angry sometimes like the other day they were comparing Tina Fey to to louis c.k and is the age-old argument who's funnier men are women fuck you fuck you here's what's funnier funny people it's not men or women like stop Amy Schumer hilarious Louis CK's Larry's and Tina Fey by the way isn't even a stand-up okay she's an actress she's funny sure she's funny on shows she's funny and I'm in movies but she's not louis c.k Lucy get writes his own shit performed his own shit it's all his opinions on the world to say that that there's some sort of a debate who's funnier him is completely distorting what the artform is in the first place it's completely distorting it like you're just looking for a fuckin salacious article title that's all you're doing I used to think I thought I thought they were like it seems like they were much more respected and now they've gone down this spiral where ever just rolling their eyes at they'll run out of shit to talk about all right well you know it's just ridiculous it gets to a certain it gets a certain time when you're covering these same stories over and over and over and over and over and over this cancel Colbert cancel Colbert one fucking joke is merited like seven or eight headlines for four articles from them all right like in the debate why he needs to make it right make it right jesus fucking christ what are you talking about make a joke right me what was his joke I mean it was so fun first of all he's a character he's a right-wing ridiculous character that says dumb shit yeah tongue-in-cheek every fucking step of the way who is it offensive to which Asian people I'll pull it up right now so we could see what the fucking Colbert controversy I'll pull it up but people are asking hash tagging hash tagging cancel Colbert because of a fucking joke okay here's the here's and he's apparently responded to it but let's find out what how many back how many can respond to that oh I don't know but they're all gross I don't know how many B's wondering how big if it's an actual big you know no it's pretty different is it you can scan through it and it's not just cancel Colbert there's like it's just like that it's like a place where all the outraged people have gone to express their outrage just they're pissed about anything and they'll just hashtag here's what they said okay it all began Thursday evening when the Colbert reports Twitter account by the way which wasn't even him wasn't even him that wrote that was someone that handles the Colbert account it's not it's not Stephen Colbert quoted a joke from a segment on Wednesdays episode so they quoted a joke from a segment so they took it out of context and that's where the outrage came quoted a joke from a segment that aired that mocked Washington Redskins owner Dan Schneider for setting up a charity to aid Native Americans in lieu of changing the team's name the original bit Colbert said he was inspired by Snyder to start his own charity called the ching chong ding dong foundation for sensitivity to Orientals or whatever that's in response to a guy who runs a team called the Washington Redskins which is an anti Native American slur making a charity for it for Native Americans without changing the name like there's a whole context to that joke I mean he's not saying that there should be a ching chong ding dong foundation he's mocking the racism of a guy whose team is called a racist name donating without changing the name I mean it's so obvious but salon has had like seven fucking articles about it some supportive but some that say he needs to make it right maybe you just cannot put that string of words together in any contest song whatever he said I think that's exactly what they're saying you can't say change can't say that that's the n-word it's hilarious I mean to try to censor contact content that much that you're taking things completely out of context completely out of the the meaning button context is the reason why language exists in the first place it's everything to be able to expand past really simple things like eat fuck shit you need context to have a goddamn language and communicate each other we have to recognize subtleties yes and when you pretend they don't exist that's when you get assholes sanctimonious fuck heads who get crazy about jokes that shouldn't get people dedicating days and days of their life to something that fucking bet there's Tracy Morgan says about stabbing his gay son they're crazy everything is taken completely out of context and everything is something that warrants cancellation you be shamed you need to be removed this is over sensitive fucking morons it's weird how what you're expressing right now is you're offended mm-hmm they offend you that's what's interesting is it's like they that what they are doing is so much more offensive than the thing they are offended by yes the way they're expressing themselves is so vile and disgusting that it makes whatever Tracy Morgan said or Patton Oswalt said or Colbert's just seem like seems so tiny compared to what they are which is they're like embryonic fascists if you gave them power and they grew out of control if that whoever is like running the show at salon met whoever's running the cancel Colbert and somehow they took power imagine what kind of world would be living oh god if you they could decide what gets on these comedy shows satire shows what you can and can't get away with how many transgenders need to be represented how many fucking gay people need to be represented how many fucking straight white males need to be made fun of along with straight white females I mean is it gonna be a chart where everything's graphed and made sure it's completely even across the board that's not life man maybe they'll find something new to be pissed off about because that's really what they love is being pissed off about stuff oh they drew they'd realize that they lost their love which is the problem it's it's when you say they it's writers it's writers that they're attracting it's not necessarily logical people it's not necessarily like representative of the organization itself they're individual writers who produce something and then somebody greenlight set but at a certain point in time you're doing more harm than good because you're so easy to mock order you're like super left-wing when you get that far out on a fucking limb and you want to cancel Coco Barrera Colbert about a really obvious joke like that you're fucking up everything because you're making yourself look unbelievably silly right like I know you feel right and I know that you have this righteous indignation behind what you're doing and you feel like the that people need to know you need to realize the harm that your words say you need to realize that there's humor okay and humor people get hurt Oh hiding about you're a bigot hiding behind the mask of a comedian people get hurt people get hurt from jokes and guess what if you get hurt from jokes you're supposed to get hurt from those jokes if you can't make fun of something about yourself that means you haven't acknowledged that something about yourself that may or may not be hilarious and there's a big difference between someone saying something unbelievably cruel and evil and someone saying something were there poking at you and laughing and obviously he was doing that obviously he was poking at the Washington Redskins guy and laugh and to deny that it's just it fuck's up the whole argument if it clouds the water with shitheads yeah it's strange to see salon.com in some way like converging with nancy grace's in some way right yeah like they're meeting somehow Solana's like put itself in this tear whoever the writers arse put themselves in that awful position where it's like oh shit I'm Nancy Grace and I her were like singing the same song and it's not all that there's a lot of great articles on there I still go there because they have a lot of great articles it's just sometimes they just go out of line it's why you need a good editor man cuz you had a few writers fuckin throw stuff out there and you do serious damage to your website or magazine like you can really fuck your shit up you could develop a reputation you end up a bad reputation like a reputation for being ridiculous Oswald is attacking you is it for fun people are looking forward to it and it rings true yeah that's the problem is it rings true what he's saying yeah if you read those titles they're all I mean those are great mock salon.com titles they're great you know but look if you go to select I get an email from them every day and there's some great things like the thing with Jon Stewart mocking CNN for its continued coverage they've got that they've got an interesting thing on Chris Christie like the governor's at all you know not all bad at all but a friend of mine hate advice for a while he's unfuck that magazine because because one article that he was offended by that came out five years ago but I mean yeah you can't blame the whole organization because one thing fucked up right [Music] [Applause] [Music]
