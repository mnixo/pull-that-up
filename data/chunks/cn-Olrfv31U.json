I think what you said is dead-on that you got to go straight he's got to go straight african-american because white people are just not heyy and we're live this is what I think we need to recognize the return of dr. Cosby and send a shout-out to him and all the folks at the barbershop I'm triggered I'm triggered you were saying before the show like what do you do if you're at a comedy club and Bill Cosby walks cuz apparently Bill Cosby's doing stand-up again like what do you do why isn't he in jail well because the first first trial was was it a mistrial yeah it was a mistrial they couldn't agree which is hilarious like I mean how many people have to say that guy drugged me and raped me how many people like is there some sort of do you imagine there's like 80 people that are telling the same story of you drugging them and raping them and people like you know I'm sorry I just I don't want any black I guess I just you know and it's interesting that this happened after this weekend was the women's March and I know like a lot of people want to roll their eyes and I was getting a lot of  on Instagram for like the rumens March you guys have this is exactly the kind of thing that I'm terrified of is that this guy is now not in jail and he's just like back to doing stand-up yeah because I don't know if we got to sensitize or if we just forgot about him or we just got sick of talking about it like how I just don't understand how people inside coming I think he's first of all he has an enormous ego and he's a psychopath and I think that he is he's just he has enough fans in enough people in his community still love him or he can go places in small places and they accept him and then he's he's he's advertising it people that accepts him with this is it people who have their own skeletons in the closet and they see him coming back as like they get Redemption in some way or maybe it makes them not be incorrigible people or is it like a herd mentality or is it just star like how do you rationalize that in your head a little bit of star  a little bit of dumpy but that he's famous eclipses the fact that he is yes but then there's also do you remember how it was right after Oh J dot innocent there was a guy and I want to say his name cuz I respect him he's a comic and he went on stage here he said no he's a black eye he goes my blackness will not allow me to think that Oh J did it and I was interesting what yeah the  that I just here yeah that's insane like okay all black people are innocent what is a black person comes in and kills your family will your blackness exonerate that person like how are you gonna handle it then and I don't know what the demo I mean what were do you know who was in that job was it all black people I don't know anything I read it like I'm just I'm sick to my stage performing and there's not like a complete melee of disapproval that's really scary to me it is scary it's scary but I think that there's a certain amount of people that get overwhelmed by celebrity he shows up like I can't believe he's here they don't like Manson goes up at a jazz club it's like he's a celebrity but he's also of Charles Mann probably less of a monster here's why I'll throw this at you he never killed anybody Charles Manson actually told people to kill people and they did and it's terrible that they did it like Tex Watson did all the crimes and what was her name squeaky Fromme she was want to try to kill Gerald Ford they they're the one who did the crimes he was just this crazy who talked these people into these things he was kind of the puppet master yeah raped who knows how many women and allegedly it's also yeah it's also um it just it scares me and shakes me to my core you know not that a psychopath to psychopathic things but the people who permit it and who are permissive yeah and are okay with it and don't resist like the fact that a bunch of people in that club were just like okay we're good okay well we don't really know what happened we just know that he was there and we know that he's gonna do another show and then he announced that he was gonna do some show at a jazz club it's like today I think is it today or tomorrow it is this jazz club I mean I don't know who owns it I don't know enough about it probably to Miami and I'm like frozen with disgust it's like that's the other thing is yesterday oh so it's already over yeah as promised he performed at a jazz club today but this article was yesterday wow it's like oh he's a man of his word he might be a rapist but he does not lie and he was wearing that hello friend's sweater that he always wears and he's got that um Bobby Brown thing on is that the microphone headpiece thing and I mean I don't know it's just so tricky because it's like I was getting all these nasty comments on Instagram this weekend like why are you getting nasty comments for what well I think with what's going on right by the posting photos from the woman's March which case the March was about a lot of things and I think just in the last month or so there's been a little bit of a roll of like this is still going on you know like there's a lot of I think guys and women also who are a little bit exhausted or I had one guy I talked to a couple weeks ago a friend of mine who was like I'm done with this done with this like we are done with sexual predators being getting in trouble and getting fired and getting cleansed from our society and possibly you know stopping from assaulting people in the future and there were so just I feel like this has gotten ridiculous you know there's I think a lot of people think it's like a hysteria or it's like women being dramatic or something like that and then something like this happens and I'm like oh are we not being dramatic enough cuz this is crazy that he's just going onstage and performing like as if everything's just kind of fine again well I think he's a bad example because I think he's nuts and I don't think it makes any sense that he's out I think I think all these people are not I think were more nuts for just being like okay I guess he's doing comedy but I don't think we are I think most people like what in the far out race yeah I sent it to Tom Segura and that was his immediate reaction was like what you give me like a bunch of corn in that jazz club in the guy that owns a jazz club you guys yeah don't know I mean we don't know who these people are comedy club and Bill Cosby gets on stage I gotta hear what the this bitch has to say like that's what I'm thinking I'm not being like awesome Bill Cosby's here so yeah maybe I should give them benefit of the doubt and assume that they think they're seeing some kind of circus show well I don't think I would say anything I don't think I mean I don't think it helps like I don't think I'll yell I don't think I would do that but I definitely think I would sit there and watch and like study him like some weird creature yeah which is what he is he's a he's an aberration in humanity like wait first of all he's an aberration in a couple ways right he's an outlier in terms of the the popularity he reached he reaches insane level popular and he did in the 60s and the 70s when the world was a different place and I really we've talked about there's a bunch time as his podcast I think a lot of people drug people back then I think it was normal I think that dropping a Mickey and someone's drinks me it was common maybe not normal yeah that's that's a better way yeah I think a lot of people did it I think a lot of people people still do it yeah well but I think a lot of famous people did it back then yeah I think they were giving out pills and I don't think I think culturally we've evolved way more than we are aware of I think we think of ourselves as being very similar to people from the nineteen sixties I don't think we are I think I think we're way I think if you go from like 1810 to 1870 I bet people are pretty goddamn similar interesting yes okay good point yeah technology is moving so fast and adapting to that and the fact that we have alarm systems in 1960 to 2018 way different yeah way different what's acceptable how people think of things what we've just yes how people I think one of the things that's happening one of the reason why guys are I rolling about the women's March is is that it's a new thing and this is his overwhelming amount of energy that's headed towards this thing and but what it represents is years decades of frustration women that had to work with Gaza grabbing their ass ain't trying to them and the pendulum swing hard it's like it snapped fast and there's also we always talked about this and I'm obsessed with epigenetic imprinting it's not just us it's our moms and our grandmothers this happened too and we carry that pain and yeah there's a lot of guys that say hey I didn't do anything I shouldn't have to feel this but this is the thing these guys saying like I'm done with this you're not even a part of this yeah like how are you done with why you don't have to go how is this inconveniencing you so like I don't know stuck in traffic well I mean that's exactly right so it's like a couple I mean you're in LA you're always sitting in women's March traffic and the Gay Pride Parade and then whatever so it's like I'm so sorry you're gonna have to like sit in traffic for an extra 20 minutes yeah like you know get your Amazon drone why are you driving on a Saturday anyway I get it I mean it makes sense I hate it I guess I just don't understand why this is such a hassle for men I don't understand why it's such an unless you were raping people assaulting people hurting people nothing's being taken away from you and I feel like a lot of men think something's being taken away from them and I don't know what that is hmm you know and I'm just a little bit confused if it's unfollow me I don't know unfollowed me if it's blowing up your Twitter for you and your Instagram I just I can't wrap my head around why this is such an inconvenience for guys and what's so threatening about it I think is that many guys they're saying this okay most men I think are recognizing like that if you look at the stories look the Harvey Weinstein one is the worst and most egregious example right I mean he's a guy that did it for decades they even enabled his pretty bad - yeah well Cosby's worse right because Cosby was like Harvey Weinstein was an obvious predator it's like hey don't don't go in the chicken coop with the wolf and here's something interesting I was also getting about this about a lot of people are like well if you knew about Harvey why didn't you say something and it's just it's such a testament to how who's someone yeah like I just got some comments so look well you knew about Harvey why didn't you say something you know when you knew about it ten years ago or what did you know I had heard like oh he likes sleeps with actresses and he like makes them them but I wasn't really in that world so I knew about it but what was I gonna call up the New York Times and be like hey I was on Comedy Central for ten minutes I have an idea you know like who was gonna let you know and it's all so it's like the kind of thing where we didn't even know what we were allowed to say and we didn't even know that there was a possibility for change or then there was a possibility that anything would be done about it like that's how ingrained in our psyche it was and how we just didn't know there was anything we just thought that's how it was well you first of all you didn't know him you didn't work under him so he did come to the comedy store once I think you were gone and this isn't like my Harvey Weinstein story like it's not close to how awful most of the women's stories are but it is I think more like kind of funny he came to the comedy store and I don't say to the main room and then I left and then Tommy called me and he was a Harvey Weinstein came here to see you he's here you need to come back and talk to him and I was like I was like already at the improv or already like whatever and I was like I don't want to go and then the only reason I did not go back at first I was like him for just like summoning me to come back I'm making $22 a Comedy Store like I don't you know and it already took me 40 minutes to get out of the comedy store parking lot I can't go back in there and I remember literally just being like the lighting and there is bad I don't want him to see me the lighting on stage is great like he saw me at my best and I really don't want to go back and like talk to him I don't like know how to do small talk with the producers I'm not you know me I'm like a neurotic mess like I'm not good at like charming and whatever but he's such a crazy way to think of things ending there was perfect you saw me at my best like let me just get the out of here but like I didn't know how bad it was but I knew you know it's like the kind of thing that it's like we didn't know we didn't don't you feel a little guilty though like what you're saying what I'm getting is that you've people saying that to you you feel like I didn't do it I didn't I'm not totally I think that there's a lot of women that kind of have done nothing wrong but we're consumed with guilt and shame like me - yeah but I I'm so glad to hear you say that cuz I'm just not hearing a lot of that I'm not hearing a lot of empathy and maybe I'm just like zoning in on Megan comments are never had a female employee and I've never worked in an office but even though you hear all the sexual harassment and any ego do I do anything yeah you got a check seems like everybody did something but it's like but we were the same way it's like I mean I remember working on a talk show and everyone's a co wolf does that count that's not as bad as right like getting granular about it like I remember I worked on a talk show late-night talk show and a guy came up to me in front of like a couple of the writers and he took his hand and like put it between my butt cheeks and just went like swiped and he was acts like a credit card machine and like everybody started laughing and of course I started laughing because I didn't write froze and I was embarrassing a friend no he was like my coworker hmm like you know okay and it was just kind of a dick comedy writer and I was like what do I do what I'm gonna do I mean at the time I had no concept that it was offensive I was emotionally so numb and unconscious in my twenties like I didn't even think to do anything about it but looking back I'm like that was up but what was I gonna call human resources and say that he it just there's all these little tiny things that aren't enough to be as sold but are too much to be appropriate and it's just like a gray area that I don't you know it's it's hard for us to to delineate what makes sense of what does well it's funny how cautious you are now I mean we're good friends but we're joking around we had these hoverboards but what you said was hilarious you you wanted to say something about its horn but you weren't sure if you could talk about it yeah because you were worried that you bringing up a porn would somehow another be sexually harassing that doesn't work you can't do that to Matt Lee you say whatever the you want I remember I give you license right now publicly say whatever the you want forever I can't sexually harass women feel it too like you know I don't want to well you don't exactly I don't want to be a hypocrite and you know I've been coming back to the comedy store a lot and I hadn't been there in the last like six months I've been working on something and I noticed when I used to go the connoisseur I used to feel like prey or any comedy club it was like you know people would hug you too long and you know you were just waiting to like have something inappropriate happen I went in the other night not one man hugged me everyone was like hello m'lady like bowing at me no one would come near me like I was a leper donnell rawlings came up to me and gave me a hug and halfway through who's like oh my god I'm so sorry am I allowed to do that now it was just like oh whoa like this is this is  crazy the tables have turned because it used to be women were terrified of men and now men are kind of terrified of much definitely guys are afraid of being called out there's a lot of that and a lot of guys going over the grade if you don't have skeletons in your closet though if you're afraid if you don't if you don't are you afraid because you know you have some well here's the thing you don't have to have skeletons in your closet so I can just have a bad relationship sure where someone's mad at you like this is e-zine sorry thing is very bizarre mm-hmm like this seems like he went on a bad date and they took turns eating each other out and blowing each other and then she didn't like it and she said that there was like I don't know what the happened cuz I wasn't there yeah but there's a lot of people yeah that are picking sides on this and here's and I'm not accusing or supporting either side cuz I don't think there's enough information yet and it all seems very like he had one experience she had one experience and if they're both telling the truth you know who knows but here's what I'll say just about my experience in my 20s as a woman is I was not fully formed yet at 22 years old I didn't know I known as I had literally no sex I wanted to have in my 20s I didn't wanna understand that now that the frontal lobe is not really fully formed in human beings 25 so hey guys in your 30s and 40s stop dating 20-year olds just in general this is a bad idea you know and I think that a really big part of the conversation that for me a blind spot is sexual abuse victims so the statistics are a little foggy but like one out of six women are sexually assaulted as children and those are only the people that come forward is that real yes one out of six one out of six is is is the statistic for people that come forward that's not even including the people that don't come forward which is a lot which and not to get too serious did you see that Olympics I'm sorry to interrupt do you see that Olympic thing makes me it makes me that Olympic thing is insane the Olympic gymnastics coach or doctor rather that was molesting girls makes me want to it makes me homicidal and when they're doing the testimony the girls are he's saying that this is too uncomfortable for him to listen to these girls I saw that guy on the street I think I'd kill him with my hands I'd have to I would go I would go batshit crazy so I don't talk about this publicly because I'm too embarrassed that's the other thing about this I think that guys some guys have this idea that us being sexually harassed is like fun for us and we like want to come forward and there's some glory in it it's embarrassing it's awful and I don't talk about my sexual assault publicly because I just like fries at night but you're very self aware there are people that take some sort of glory in being victimized maybe I can't I can't speak to that I mean what I mean by that is to the point where they will exaggerate any sort of interaction with someone so there's people there but men and women I say here's what I'll say that that could be true I don't know enough about the science of that and I'm not a psychiatrist but my experience was the opposite I minimize mine I didn't come all people do I didn't come to terms the fact that I was actually sold till I was 32 I'm 35 like I just kind of figured this out and there's a lot of stuff that is still blind spots that I don't want to deal with and and I was only able to write about it in my book because I just I can't talk about it publicly like I freeze up I get weird and scared and one of the trauma responses of if you've been sexually assaulted as a child is that when a man moves towards you or you have any kind of sexual see I'm like getting all nervous me when you have a sexual interaction you freeze up because when you were sexually assaulted as a child it didn't serve you to fight back and you had to kind of disassociate right that is that's why people get confused with it fight or flight it's not just fight or flight free freeze I have a clear about what I'm saying so nobody misconstrues is what I'm saying I'm not talkin about real victimization I'm talking about people that love to play the victim sure there are a lot of people that I'm not talking about real victim when I say that people take glory and victimization I don't mean someone has actually been sexually assaulted I mean someone who may have had a weird interaction with the person when they said something today and by the way I've done that like um you know I get bummed to the comedy store and I'm like can you  believe I got bumped it's like I just I'm getting adrenaline and dopamine from like being self-righteous or having been wronged or something I I know what you mean from that perspective but I think when it's something real yeah my reaction is to come freezing is a big one yeah so it's like that's also a big one with assault if people get not just sexual things but physical assault a lot of one of the things that happens to people when they're confronted by someone in a dangerous situations that panic and they freeze they don't do anything they don't literally can't move so if at least 20% of women have that who knows what the is going on in some of these interactions so for me like in my 20s when a guy came towards me I would freak out and and people go why didn't they say no why didn't they leave because I'm frozen and I don't know what to do and anybody that says that has never been involved in any sort of real altercation when they're in danger anybody says why didn't you just did well you don't know why you didn't do things yeah there's times in my life when I look back and why didn't I  say something yeah yeah why didn't I tell that guy to off or well you don't know what to do that's a lot of I mean that was me my whole twenties why didn't I tell him no why did he leave why didn't I tell him to stop like you know so so a lot of it I didn't even understand because I was too young too and I also I didn't it took me 15 years of a 12-step program and therapy and EMDR to even be able to same deal EMDR I movement reprogramming and desensitization how the would you expect anyone to know what that means where you could just your fans are so  smart and like there's such neurology nerds yeah but that's off the deep end it's a post-traumatic stress disorder or therapy it was started for Vietnam vets and it helps you to sort of deactivate traumatic experiences have you ever done ecstasy no yeah and OBM a therapy is supposed to be amazing for people that have gone through trauma been told about this I'm gonna go to Coachella next year I don't know if that's the place but it's supposed to be amazing for people that have gone through real traumatic experiences that are just so ingrained in their mind like the memories of those experiences are ingrained with trauma and horrible feelings and somehow another MDMA therapy allows people to separate from that and and who's the trigger and like lose lose this that sounds like a way more fun way to do it because MDR is like you sort of have to relive the memory and then other  gets on earth and things start clicking into focus well the reason why they call it access is because that's literally what you feel you feel so much love and what would and I only did it once but the thing that stunned me was how comparatively insecure I am in regular life comparatively insecure can you say that comparatively insecure compared to when you're on X 0 you're so friendly and so warm and so I try to be yeah yeah but when you're when you're on ecstasy you really realize like all the hitches in your person out all the things that are holding you back it made me I only did it once but it made me completely aware of insecurities that I didn't even know that's fascinating yeah let's do that yeah you do it you trip out it's very interesting I'm super into it I had another friend recommend that and I'd be down because it's also like you know and something else I'll say not to speak for all women like I'm not the face of all women but like with this administration if you're a sexual trauma survivor seeing this guy on the news every day can be really triggering I see his post about the women's marching his Twitter literally can't read the news anymore because I'm too activated and I'm just I'm going crazy I'm Way too activated like every his seeing a sexual predator or someone I deemed to be a sexual predator with all the women that have come forward in the news every day is activating my trauma response of I think he's a predator I don't think it's just sexual I think business I think he's a predator in politics I think he's I mean if you look at the way he campaigned you know like about the Hillary Clinton locker up lock her up yeah this is predatory yes he's a bully yeah well he's a he's a winner need to say it that way can I tell you and I was do you remember I think it was I don't know was the primaries or it was like when Ben Carson was still in the mix and they were all lined up and I remember seeing and this was when we all thought it was like a joke and he called all of them out he was like you've asked me for money and you've asked me for money and you've asked me for money I was like that's hot like this the the reptilian brain was like oh like that guy's a winner he's not scared of anything and with the sound off I'm like that's the Alpha if hits the fan I'm following that guy he's old he's lived a long life he's on speed there's are a lot of money and there's all these reports that he's on diet pills do you believe that syphilis theory no no no that when you have can you look this up as if you haven't already diet pill thing though no is that like caffeine or is that like yes well son he's on some sort of amphetamines apparently according to several sources one of them that tracked his prescription from Duane Reade pharmacy in New York from a few years back that he was on this one type of amphetamine for like eight years did you take drug test if you're the president no I don't even know no you don't Wow no this is amazing you you have to take a drug test you work for UPS Wow take a drug test if you have the nuclear football how is that not yeah well I don't know it doesn't meanwhile Jeff Sessions is trying to take pot away from everybody and Donald Trump's popping pills I don't know if he's really popping pills I just should say this but what I've read is that what he's taking what they believe he's taking is do you member fen fen no fen fen was some that went went on in the 90s it was a diet pill that they had to stop taking because it was super effective for people but it was essentially speed they they lost their appetite mr. Perret and everybody lost at rim do you remember that diet pill I took that leg when I was in high school and how eating disorder that's um that's similar all these things are similar because they're amphetamines they're speed they're all they're all stimulants yeah and there's one of the ingredients in fen fen when the two of them are combined together fen fen is two different things and see if you could find that story about what they think that he's on in the other this gives you delusions of grandeur that's the thing we literally don't need like the symptoms first of all think about the amount of energy this guy had running for president giving these long stretches never seem tired yeah dot rumored donald doctor prescribed donald trump cheap speed bitch is amazing who made the picture whose Jim Jim Cooke Jim Cooke you're a wizard whoever you are his neck looks like a elephant laws that made me laugh hard the orange is perfect it's like such an exact but just exaggerated just enough the eyes rock salt lamb gotta be able to laugh while this is going on can't you can't okay rumors of Trump's predilection I love that word predilection for stimulants first started really popping up in 1992 and just by magazine wrote he ever wondered why Donald Trump has acted so erratically at times full of energy of manic energy paranoia and wow what is that word guru ulis garrulous Carol you ever use a word garrulous it's like I thought like cheerful like garrulous hmm well you're speeded up well he was a patient of dr. Joseph Greenberg's from 1982 to 1985 at the time dr. Greenberg was notorious for allegedly dolling out prescription stimulants to anyone who would pay blah blah blah blah diet drugs Trump took a try at drugs and also be fat because he's eating a lot of terrible things okay this is the stuff okay fen-phen it's called thin to remain first gained notoriety in the US under the name fen-phen a miracle combination of phentermine and fen flora mean another established anti-obesity drug the two of them together the only problem was with patients taking the drug began reporting damage to their hearts and lungs apparently the combination take more is true the patient's body's so he's not taking both of them he's taking one phentermine on its own however is still prescribed trouble with thinking speaking or walking decreased ability to exercise false or unusual sense of well-being insomnia nervousness and this is my suicide note increasing sexual ability desire drug that's not true confusion sure I mean so this is this is doctor prescribed yes this is what I think why wouldn't you just say yeah well that's a good one yeah but it's the same thing we both look Siri Trump adderall is essentially like incredibly similar there it is a medical theory many mental health professionals believe the president is ill but what if the causes and apparently syphilis untreated creates like like reddening of the face manic behavior the greater I can't read this his face is pale its orange skin color oh is that self-tanner yeah if you look at his eyes syphilis why his eyes are white all around his eyes like a raccoon they're white okay okay it's characterized by the development of an ulcer usually genital a few weeks in a few months after sexual contact of the infected person if the ulcers not noticed not to do Secretary stage the disease is seen in some patients weeks or months later these patients may develop a variety thank you of you you're leanin I know that you're so obsessed because I can't see where I favor I want to get to the behind you too oh I can't swivel I hurt my back I told you that I hurt my back on your  Segway trying to impress you I'm suing you I'm suing you we have video cameras everywhere in this place I'm not neuropsychiatric disorder neurosyphilis symptoms are neurosyphilis are Prout protein changing varying widely from one individual to another irritability loss of ability to concentrate delusional thinking and grandiosity memory insight and judgment can become imperative he's got everything and they're duking it out inside he got syphilis in the 80s from stormy Brown whoever and now he's got delusional thinking and grandiosity stormy Brown and then it also makes your hair like fluffy and just exactly says 90 years old you're gonna lose your hair so I mean you can see why we're all a little triggered yeah but I don't think I think people are reaching for straws I mean he just got that was interesting the doctor that examined him examined him and said that he probably if he had a good diet he'd live to be like 200 years old he's got just great genes that doctor that examined him I was like this is doctor the guy that heard Michael Jackson it says doctor but here's the thing after he did that then Sanjay Gupta examined the actual results yeah Sanjay Gupta said well no there's actually an issue here and the issue is something to do with arteries and something to do with the potential for future stroke or heart attack and he was going on he was basing it on actual test results and obviously I don't know jack-shit about medicine but see if you could find out what he said he's a common form of heart disease yeah see scroll up and see if you could find what it said there yeah here it is this is what is doctor Ryan Jackson disclosed Trump's basic lab measurements physical exam and the conclusion of a cognitive exam known as the Montreal cognitive assessment additionally the President had had an echocardiogram of his heart as well as a stress test both described as normal all those not a part of the official medical records that were released yesterday after further questioning Jackson also revealed that Trump underwent coronary calcium CT scan now this is it his score was 133 and anything over a hundred indicates plaque is present and that the patient has heart disease according to Trump's official records in 2009 his coronary calcium score was 34 does the president have an obligation to be in shape I mean wasn't Robert Taft like notoriously obese like do you have to be in shape to be the president I don't know the answer that's a good question like do you are there certain boxes you have to check what I'm getting out of this is it Sanjay Gupta who is an unconnected third party who's unbiased yes is going basically just off of these coronary calcium CT scans yeah and what he's showing is the difference between how it was in 2009 which was 34 2013 which is 98 and then 2018 which is 133 you're saying it's increased yes basically doubled every it's bad couple years is bad everything over a hundred indicates heart disease I'm not gonna say anything else bad I'm worried I'll get death threats we worried that you want him to get this no I just I just you know what say millions of people you know but I think that's the other thing I think we're all sort of just just especially angry like when you were talking about the pendulum swinging so hard yeah of women it's like having to see this constantly every day in the news this guy is it's it's hard it's really hard and depressing trying to be objective this is what I find fascinating about it is that obviously this is an aberration like no one's ever seen something like this before yeah no one's ever seen a president there's a video that was on go to the typical liberal Instagram page there's a video of him saying and no one is better at blank than him and it's like a video that was actually put together by people to mock him but the Trump supporters actually love it yeah play this because there are 24 things nobody's better at than Trump nobody can do it like me nobody nobody can do it like nobody's stronger than me nobody has better toys than I do there's no toy or better at the military than I ain't nobody loves the Bible more than I do nobody builds walls better than me nobody's better to people with disabilities than nobody's fighting for the veterans like I'm fighting for them and there's nobody that's done so much for equality as I have there's nobody more pro-israel than I am there's nobody more conservative than me there is nobody that respects women more than I do Isis Trump nobody's ever had crowds like Trump is you could say people and they couldn't corroborate it I know what it means nobody knows more about trade than me in the history of this country has ever known so much about infrastructure as Donald Trump nobody can do it like me I'm not a scientist I don't know that much about this like or more humble about it I wish she wasn't president because I love him I love how what a character he is he's entertaining he's fascinating that's fascinating yeah but he has powers yeah does the brain he's doing horrible just a character and as the host of a reality show yeah he's a gem I mean free Oh to be on a reality show great sign me up but to be running the most powerful country in the world well I don't know maybe China's now but is really really scared well it's just fascinating the supporters to like I love reading his support because I'm always trying to figure out which ones are Russians these are Russian a lot of them are women there's a few that are women yeah but what's the deal with those girls you know I here's what I'll say and I have some family who voted for him who are in you know exile working class and their whole thing is like we don't we don't care all we care about is the bottom line in our jobs it's actually kind of a luxury and that's I think a fair flaw with what's happening with this you know women's you know movement conversation is right now the people getting the most visibility or millionaires you know that's sort of them for the most part who's speaking up right now and like you know that's what time's up is for to enfranchise people who don't have the kind of resources to just like you know what you're mistreating me I'm gonna quit my job you know a lot of people can't quit their job and they have to tolerate sexual harassment and whatever and they don't really have a choice in the matter they have to stay in bad relationships because they can't afford to get their own place or whatever but um but all they heard was jobs their thing is like we don't care anything about his character we think all politicians are assholes we just want jobs and that's what he said he was gonna promise and he lied you know so they were just like sort of laid well isn't there more jobs now than ever before and isn't the unemployment as low as it's ever been but he was but he was promised I mean health insurance I think they don't bail so I thought they're working at this like magical health insurance reform which they didn't get but there was also he was promising like coal mine jobs which is so crazy my family members like we're gonna work in coal mines I'm like really that's 50,000 jobs and they're it's starting to become obsolete so he promised kind of jobs that I think the pipeline and like that so I think that you know and they just watch Fox News and they believe everything that's been they think like liberal news is a lie you know so I think it's like the kind of jobs that they promised and I know and I think that you're exactly right it's like their whole thing is unemployment going up is what helps women because more women can get jobs isn't in the case where when when you see like unemployment and and how more people are doing better than before and the economy is doing better than it's ever been before it's like a natural cycle like wasn't it already charting in that direction when Obama was leaving I was gonna say I think it's the president that's like four years prior that usually is what caused it because you can't just like become president then all of a sudden there's more jobs it's something that has to start a little bit earlier I'm not saying Obama I don't know that's not it when Obama got in office everybody was blaming him like right before his sure sure here goes so I'm gonna be gained a net 11.5 million jobs the unemployment rate dropped below the historical norm for perseverate weekly earnings for all workers were up 4.1 percent after inflation the gain was three point seven percent or just production and non-supervisory employees after-tax corporate profits also set records as the stock profits S&P 500 index rose one hundred sixty six percent there was some story about how the tax break that we got here because of Trump that people got that California was going to somehow another impart some sort of a ten percent surcharge to counterbalance that but and I was like Platts but then that they said it was all going to like social program so I'm like well that's a good thing you all for paying more taxes if those taxes can go to poor communities that's what I feel like I feel like if there's one thing that we need to concentrate in this country is people that are disenfranchised and live in poor communities that don't feel like there's any hope and then setting up community centers setting up some some education programs setting up the safe places where kids can go they don't have to worry about gang violence and and just making it safer for people and giving them more opportunities to possibly get out of that horrible cycle of unemployment and and and welfare and crime and feel like people are stuck in and I completely agree and when I think about that I'm like oh you know in mind this is just my point of view because of what I come from and maybe it's being a woman a female brain whatever but like when I hear that I'm like the thing that perpetuates that cycle is having kids too soon and having a lack of access to birth control and education and this administration is a huge threat to that an enemy to that so I'm like what brain would why what's up dates you faster than kid well is that just a straight-up Republican that pull this thing I'm so sorry I always have this don't have it like I always do this no I what does this say about me it just do any of your other guests has a special okay before I chose it was yelling because I wasn't in the mic but why is it is Republican thing it's always a Republican thing to try to deny women birth control to try to restrict abortion this is always a Republican I think it probably boils down to religion yes and I don't I still can't understand why religion is the reason that people think women have to be cows this is what's so crazy yeah well he used to I mean I think a lot of its kind of like Keeks conveniently now super pro-life or something nobody hates abortion more than me I wish I could do it I can't you don't you don't it's chilling I know I don't I don't want to hear it last thing we need is more Trump impressions at the Comedy Store I'm good but uh Steve Byrne has a really good really it's really good I didn't see it coming either he did it the other night and whoa whoa he nails it that's kind of amazing he nails it yeah uh it's a probably does that later does the finger thing that's great I mean alec baldwin's is like it yeah but um but yeah I think it's religiously sort of based and in hubris based I mean just a idea that women shouldn't have control over their own bodies it's just like why do you want me to have kids that I'm not ready for it really it's our economic system it means everyone else has to pay more taxes it puts more people on welfare all the things that Republicans hate do you think that it's a vulnerability thing they like women to be vulnerable maybe maybe and what they want control over control over yeah yeah complete control over people they've never met why do you want to control the uterus of a woman that lives ten states down from you how does that I think there's a sick thing that people have where they want to control people in a lot of ways I think that's a lot of when you see people that are trying to control people's language when you see people you see don't say this say this word don't say this where there's a weird instinct that we need to address when you outside of ideology outside of you political lines that you cross there's a weird instinct that people have and try to control people it's just a fear-based saying or thing that people do they don't have much control of themselves and they want to control their people and I think this is where bullying comes from and I think this is where a lot of what sexual harassment and just the entitled meant the the way bosses behave yeah when they're employed like this is one of the things about Harvey Weinstein that I found fascinating is that he would bark at his employees they would run and they were terrified and I stayed a girl and she was when I first came to LA wonderful woman beautiful perfect personality terrified of her paws she worked as an agent's assistant hmm she couldn't have been a nicer person yeah and this girl would wake up in the middle of the night terrified sure that her agent that she was working for needed her to do something she would freak out she was like constantly worried and this guy I mean she made terrible money it was constant stress and she would work insane hours I mean they would make she'd make like $400 a week and she was working instances before they had the rules of yeah you know I don't know what she really made I'm just guessing she was always broke and then my questions for you or that Stockholm Syndrome super real thing yes and then what was her relationship with her dad was she recreating her childhood circumstances was done that it wasn't good yeah it's it's only till very very recently that we were not completely dependent on men for our survival and that you guys weren't killing us in the street like it's so recent in terms of human evolution and you know I did this movie with Neal Brennan and we were all the female brain and it's about all the  because I'm obsessed with figuring out and you're so good at delineating what's nature and what's nurture what's a choice and what's not what's biologically neurologically driven and what's socially constructed I'm that's my fascination in life and like when all this stuff happens I'm always trying to figure out this kind of behavioral stuff and then that it talks a lot about epigenetic imprinting so it's like even if your girlfriend at the time had not gone through some sort of trauma with a man her mom certainly did and then her mom's mom certainly did and she carries that with her so all of a sudden you're in 2016 and a man is yelling you and it's like flashback to 1850 when like one of your answer was being murdered by a guy you know like we just don't think about that kind of stuff but what I meant to say is Neil had we used to have the storyline that was about sexual harassment we ended up kind of changing it its sucessfully strong and Blake Griffin storyline about her because women are generally wired for consensus we get dopamine from consensus right because we are physically weaker I know nobody wants to talk about it when you mean by consensus what do you mean in terms of like if you guys are arguing about something I mean we're on a show that kind of encourages you know healthy discourse and I know you guys a little bit and I feel safe here but in general in a work environment I'm gonna try to get everyone to agree because 2,000 years ago getting everyone to agree made my life safer if I'm eight months pregnant I need protection from the whole tribe and I want everyone to agree I'm gonna pretend I agree with things that maybe I actually don't don't make sense we get dopamine from harmony because I'm less able to defend myself especially with men I need you to like me because I need your protection right we're not that different I mean 200 years ago I needed your protection like my brain has not caught up to the fact that like it's illegal for you to attack me and break me now it doesn't mean anything though I think it means something to our reptilian brains you know legal part doesn't mean anything that's true no one no one's gonna save you totally correct that's correct you could kill me or you could whatever you wanted but 200 years ago it was like you know what there was no phones to even call to report any was just much more common i what i'm saying this today that like i want anyone saying that that fear is alleviated because there's laws against it as crazy totally those fears are always there completely yeah my reptile brain just in my conscious brain I'm sort of like okay it's less likely that this is gonna happen cuz we all have this illusion of being civilized you know that's all horseshit I get nervous when I interview Francis in Ghana after a fight like when I got when I had to interview him Saturday night because 265 pounds at six foot four and he smashes people's heads in for a living and I stand next to him and I feel like a little tiny person yeah this is just no getting around that and here's the thing and that's why it's like that he likes me anything to me but exactly what you're saying to me right now is what I'm trying to explain to people that are like understand women's room why are you guys freaking out in the office as we're talking those people it's it's like what are we gonna rape you it's like yeah maybe I don't get an elevators with guys I disagree for the next one I'm scared we have tribal thinking kids and this is right now there's a tribal boundaries that are being established on the male and female side and people are picking sides and there's a bunch of men that are annoyed that people are talking too much about women yeah there's a bunch of women that are saying now it's my time to be a  crazy bitch and go crazy and attack all these men and take but there are some but there are say maybe I don't what I'm saying is see see you saying that right there yeah we are not trying to do this that's a crazy thing to say I don't know anybody like that I don't who where honestly people yeah I follow a lot of really insane people on Instagram there's a lot of like there was a woman that was she's like an editor for Vogue or something yeah that said here's an unpopular opinion I am not at all concerned with men being falsely accused of sexual harassment or sexual assault that's irresponsible well yes but they exist those people exist there's the burn it all down people yeah them we're bernhard all day yeah doesn't matter it doesn't matter it's inherently tribal sorry this is a tribal thing yeah and it's not there's no nuance to that there's no consideration of all the different kinds of men there's a lot of men that are considerate and friendly and nice and they don't and they're they're concentrating on themselves they don't want anything bad to happen anybody else but there's men who like these bitches yeah all women oh they're all whores bitch and they listen to rap music like yeah I've been listening a lot of like really bad rap music lately that is one of the rare places yeah well you could still just be a straight-up misogynist and then do you think and I'm always and I don't know the answer to this do you think because I think porn definitely affects our psyche and how we view dehumanize women just system right especially young people watching it do you think that a rap song going destroy that murder that beat that  up do you think that that affects the way men view women on like a cellular level it's it's impossible that it doesn't it's impossible when you have something that's incredibly popular and you're repeating the words to it over and over again I don't know what percent yeah of an effect it has on a 20 year old brain right whether it has a 5% effect over your parenting and what your life experiences have been all the various different variables that come into your your psyche like what what what makes you a human being I don't know but that's a factor it's a factor it is in what is in what happens and when you hear beat that like is that why do guys cheer for that like aren't we also kind of on some level wired to protect why is it like it's like it's like a it's like a personal thing okay it's it's too it's too much of a bummer you don't want me to tell you most of my tattoos are white I have white ones everywhere but you are fun and crazy here's what I will say is that burn it all down I want to pay 5,000 tattoos you're covered why am I crazy because you can't see me - I'm not saying I'm not crazy crazy I'm probably pretty crazy really yeah you hide it very well well I matter you channel it you manage it in all the ways you get it out oh if I didn't man if you didn't work out every day would you just be I would murder people in the street probably been in jail a long time you would be like breaking apes out of zoos and fighting them I don't think that I think I would have done something really stupid a long time ago yeah yeah I but I think that there's a lot of men that have terrible genetics and instincts and environments that they grow up in and there's a lot of violence in your life and yeah you you either find a way through that for me the the way through it was martial arts if I didn't find martial arts who knows yeah and I think that is one of the best ways for men to not be pieces of to know because I think a lot of the way totally pride in other things so that you have just and do ecstasy it gives you that'll help to but give you some security and give you an outlet for your aggression and give you some humility like in martial arts you get humility you get strangled all the time you learn humility right right you get some Oh real fast you can't imagine you go oh you do it to them they do it to you everybody does ten you hug and there's like real genuine love and affection between the guys that I do jujitsu with it's very it's it's it's very intense it's as real as it gets and here's something sorry I just wanted to go back to that vogue woman for a second or whoever that was because it's like I think what I'm trying to do is understand like what a man acts in a way that's violent or whatever I'm like what's the root of that what's going on what happened in his childhood like what's going on biologically or genetically or like what has he been taught like he was failed somehow if a guy feels the need to like rape a woman someone failed him or he's a sociopath and just should be locked up or his mentally ill but like he sought from his dad he learned it hurt people hurt people so it's like when a woman says like all men should I don't care if their front leg I'm like what happened to her that made her think that that's an okay that's her paradise she probably met a bunch of assholes yeah something went wrong yeah it was probably guys that she grew up with guys that were in her life dad there's a lot of variables and I guess I'm just trying to start a conversation it's like let's explore what happened back then and how do we sort of stop that from going on whether it's like sexual abuse physical abuse whether it's like the messages we get growing up of like and I don't know how you parent your kids but the idea of like all I heard growing up was calm down relax it's fine be seen like the messages that we give kids calm down relax before about what anything any time I cried or I was injured or whatever it was calm down you're overreacting that's what I heard as a kid growing up bothered you I think it did be were you overreacting it caused me to I mean I was a kid right I don't know when we win kids but don't you think that kids should be assured like it's okay it's just a small booboo you're gonna be fine normally what kids do when they're crying is they're just testing to see how available you are to them right so when you go calm down everything's fine sort of let me tell you I don't know someone who has kids yeah they do that but then they also recognize that it's a way that they can get attention so they will overreact on purpose but another difference yes they'll have fits if they don't go to the movie they like to say sure like if my two daughters want to go see a movie and one of them wins and the other one starts to throw a temper tantrum you gotta go look we're gonna go see a fun movie right like you can't get pissed off next time you'll get to choose yeah this is crazy you can't stomp your feet and cry but she's seven yeah totally but this is like I have a chance to explain to her that these feelings are natural yeah you're gonna win some you're gonna lose some but you can't hold on to that you gotta let it go and realize oh we're still gonna go to go to see a fun movie right it's just not gonna be this one it's gonna be that great you know for whatever reason we made a decision sure you know and we try to be as fair as possible but you can't have temper tantrums over all the time oh we're going to the wrong restaurant you know kids do that joke that's because they're little kids think they're recognizing that there's some influence that they have some power over you and then I'm gonna see how much power I can get and how much attention I can get and how much I can play you so you just have to figure out the difference I think for me I learned to invalidate my own reality and stuff my feel iver my I remember a specific moment where I was like you can't rely on adults they won't help you figure it out yourself or don't have those feelings or invalidate those own feelings you know and I think there's probably a that was bad parenting you know what your kids you know like if I'm hurt don't tell anyone cuz hunting is  confusing cuz you try to figure out what what bad parenting you received I was lucky in that my parents were very busy so I didn't get a lot of parenting yeah me too same way so it wasn't it wasn't like I got bad parenting I didn't get back there yeah anybody who was mean to me yeah I just got yeah I was alone a lot I was but then I found things to occupy my time so that literally became like those obsessions that I that I developed when I was young with various things where was art or martial arts or whatever those things became my vehicles for developing my human potential yeah and that do you think you got a lot of eye contact as a kid I never thought about that until just now apparently that's a big one I can't I contact in physical touch in the first couple years you know we're affection that my family's always been affection it's always been huggy yeah you know an unreal hug you with my family too I think and I'm hug you with my friends too I just I think that's super important and I think it's also very important to tell you friends like I tell everybody I love them yeah that's awesome I mean I know I got really into John Bowlby theory of attachment cuz I couldn't make eye contact until like two years ago like I would always kind of look here really yeah this is how I used to always look at people and then I just recently started making eye contact and it still makes me a little bit uncomfortable it's like a muscle but I had something called infant maternal disruption which is basically you just didn't get enough eye contact so apparently the amount of eye contact and what do you know this because I'm because I can't make it now but isn't that just a insecure look I used to get real and secure I've talked about this before or talking to a bank teller I'd freak out why I get nervous I was nervous well only bank tellers are just remember being in the bank getting ready to deposit a cheque and in line there's two people ahead of me because it was the old time for the comedy story to know if we'll go through that was before the way before then it was before I did comedy was it it did had anything to do with a man or a woman no no didn't matter it's just I just was nervous talking to people that's so interesting I like that too like the first couple minutes you talk to me all the time I get a little shake like I'm socially awkward in the beginning and then I sort of settle in but I do get a little shaky when I first talk to people even now well I feel that with you I feel like I have to say we're friends like right away we thing with the porn and the hoverboard you look this is Thai really shouldn't bring this out never the you want to say I get um you know and I think I have also have this condition called codependence I'm working on it but I'm dealing with it it's expensive to handle it's very time-consuming to rewire your brain around it but when I first meet someone it's like a you it's like a chameleon response where it's like when you grow up in a alcoholic home or if you have codependence the first thing you do is you meet someone and you kind of try to figure out what they want and then you morph to become what makes them comfortable so I still have to fight that response sometimes especially well especially with men and then with women you can do that too though men do that for sure like are you in football or Unibet like who is this guy and how am I gonna make him like me I don't have what codependency men well men do that with other men but they also do that with women they'll become like what the woman wants like women will I see it a lot of times my with the way they dress like the Queen come along yeah well also the women women am old men like women will get men in the shape like you should just like in a relationship I just mean like when I first meet someone my instinct is kind of like how do I make in especially with it's it has taken me so long to not be funny when I'm not doing stand-up because like the firm I first didn't thing does makes this person laugh make them like you and I kind of have to like manually be like turn that off you're not five and you're not trying to get the approval of your dad like no you're not you turn it off but what if you just see something funny you're still free enough to just be funny I can do that but it's like my motive is not I'm trying to make this person like me my motive is just fine all the time all the time just say his name it's genuinely Brian isn't trying to get anyone no he's just really funny and he loves being Brian is I've said this before there's an innocence to it he's at his best in a group of people right not on stage he's around twenty people if you got twenty people and they're going somewhere Brian's like guys guys guys I want to show you something just helped us be this he's I've never met anybody that makes me laugh harder just and groups of people's like and joy Diaz kills me but Joey Diaz is the opposite Joey Diaz is not trying to do that Bryan Callen knows the difference anymore like is there a certain point where you don't even you can't even tell when you're performing and when you're not it's like just he's morph doesn't matter he doesn't care yeah he has a bizarre ability to not care if people are upset at him or it's like he's got this weird of almost Peter Pan like way of moving through life it's correct I am I am in therapy and a 12-step program to get the inner monologue of Bryan Callen if I could just have an iota of the self esteem that he has do you do you meditate I do I lost my dad last year and meditate like suddenly and my meditations I started getting too sad like I couldn't close my eyes for 20 minutes so I've stopped for the past like six months but I'm trying cuz I need to build those neural pathways well I feel like you're always do you know that feeling when you're running down a hill or it's super hard to stop ya know look you have like this momentum it's like well you're still up but it's  it's tricky that's how I feel you are like you're running on a slight angle yeah you know you're not flat yeah it's not your always like a little I'm  I am sometimes I think in the last yeah I agree mmm I'm trying to answer in a way that makes you seem wrong but I realize you're you're pretty right and I think that also in the last couple years that we've gotten to know each other I haven't been doing is not as much stand-up and when I don't do stand-up I get a little manic mmm I think that stand-up serves are really important like release and catharsis purpose where I'm much more calm when I'm not performing when I do stand-up right you get it out right you get out those talks there's these antagonistic and protagonistic thoughts all these dear weird little ideas that are wrestling in your head like you can put them into a comedy form and then deliver that I'm on stage it's a very cathartic way of releasing ideas sometimes and then when the audience laughs you know you're like ah I nailed this I'm on to something here I got it and there's just I think that you know and again I can not to beat that I come from a we all do tricky home and I think that my brain seeks control or even a false sense of control soothes it and when I do stand-up you kind of get to have control for at least the 20 minutes or an hour that you're onstage and everything feels like it's an order I know my place you know your place is very clearly defined rules I'm talking you're laughing I'm talking you're laughing and that makes me feel really calm whereas going through the world with like I don't know who you are you're dangerous I don't you know like I have a hyperactive amygdala so it's like during the day I'm just very dysregulated and doing stand-up is just I don't know I just feel very like I know where everybody's place is and I feel safe for that amount of time do you get calmed down by working out a little bit because my motive for working out is so up it's not like - you know I'm working more on like working out to get strong and to get healthy but for the longest time it was like to get skinny and to look you know so working out was like I was kind of hate  it I wasn't like doing it because I enjoyed it I wanted to be doing it so I'm trying to sort of find a new motive what kind of exercise do you do I get bored and I used to work with a trainer and I stopped and so I started just started doing it myself like lifting and I just want to have a big butt so I really care about I'm just wanting to ass so I'm like use that machine or is it called the Jimmy John machine I don't know do you know it's a it's a squat machine but it has like a little helper it has little claws what is it this mini machine is the the rack where the squat goes up and down just turn it forward to catch it that's what I do why don't you do that yeah that's that's a good machine to do it's good it's good to do on your own that's actually just oh yeah that's a smith machine yeah that's what I do at the gym those are good and then I do a lot of people don't like those because you don't have to balance them no the idea is that there's there's a benefit to all the stabilizing muscles like you have a real I'm to a DD if I do that when I'm afraid I'll hurt myself the jimmy-john helps me to not I'm not like a professional athlete I'm just I should get a hug in pill form but I was doing like SoulCycle I was doing like spinning for a while yeah just because whatever there's a great episode of the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt oh really you even watch that show no it's funny though I've seen a couple of a hilarious gray went down for like two episodes and I almost abandoned great kind of tell you folks if you if you're watching it now I could have talked a lot of people into watching it when you get to like episode six of season one don't panic it sucks for two episodes and then it bounces back I loved it it was strong it's hilarious and they made fun of spinning oh there's one with Nick Kroll yeah I love night and he's he's the spin instructor yes I don't want to give it up but it's like it's a cult these soul sorry I used to go to SoulCycle and cry I'm not kidding they'll play like Sheryl Crow or like pink like you know Neil breaded always says that I have the musical taste of a 45 year old divorcee I love an inspirational Kelly Clarkson's I swear to god Oh Hank Cheryl crow Alanis Morisette like I will just get in there and you just start crying because you're in a lot of pain and you're working really hard and you're just vulnerable and we feel like it's okay to cry cause you're sweating sweat or tears it's me and a bunch of like publicists crying bunch of because it's $35 class it's crazy you know that much I think it's like I mean if you buy like a hundred packages it ends up being like 28 if you have a thing called a peloton bike oh that's the no no I tried it it supposed to be amazing yeah someone else's do a live spin class with people we have it here so do you do spin it you like no they give it to me on a fan no I mean I would use it and do it but I have one here because it's like I can get in groove and I can check out and think about other things and like sort of that's it's like a moving meditation for me that's how I feel about regular running when I run the hill to running but now I'm running with my dog it's a different dynamic because I always have to keep an eye on him yeah but he's pretty good he waits and waits for me and then I run and he's so much different that's amazing yeah he's great he's great but he's not it all my other dogs been psycho so I've had to have them on leashes because they would attack other kinds of doubles I had a bunch of pit bulls so I'd run with them and you know and my Mastiff I just never ran with him he's too big yeah yeah yeah this thing is bad for his he's always limping a little bit too he runs around too much in the yard he's huge they're too big they're meant to just hang out and you know and I'm running really steep retriever yeah that's great that dog is running with animal best feeling but me and him have this crazy bond it's like when we stop like I'll stop when I run the hills mhm I'll pause cuz it's like you know I'm running this big sprint up to the top of the hill and then he'll he'll sit and wait with me and then he just like I love you and you like jump up and kiss me and myself I love you too buddy like calm down but it's like he's so excited that I do this with him he loves him so grateful we have this crazy bond thing yeah it's really intense yeah I've always bought like he's a sweet dog I bonded with him from the moment we got him but we have this extra bond now that we run three or four times a week oh yeah totally well you're a pack yeah you're a pack together than if you're running again the day you found some  I don't know if was his usually shit's in this area my dog to hike and he came back he lied like let him go psych all right let's see how this goes let's see if this is gonna end a lawsuit for me and so I let him go he comes back he's covered in like he smells like like Wharf I can't explain the rancid smell I'm just like what is that he's covered in like he's got like stringy like said like I said spaghetti and then I keep walking there's a dead deer he had rolled in a dead deer carcass just covered in worms and guts and eyeballs like for adoption because don't they do it because my dogs want coyotes Quixote's when coyotes in my yard my girl rolls in it because don't you do it so that the Coyotes think you're in the pack so they don't kill you oh I think that's what you do it Wow fire up that Google make sure I'm not yeah they roll in the so that the coyote doesn't kill them there's a guy I follow on Instagram that has a pet coyote and he hunts coyotes and he uses this pet coyote to learn help him hunt coyotes I know I think that's persons and they hunt car while hunting coyotes is important in areas where coyotes attack deer fawns and ah coyotes is this in California no no he's he's a hunter I mean the guy's just a hunter period one of the things that he's done he found a puppy a coyote puppy that had been abandoned and so he adopted it and she lives with him it's really weird coyotes are like well coyotes can't attune to human faces like they're basically sociopathic they they're not like dogs you can't domesticate them yeah you maybe not true because this dog seems to be very playful with him yeah and and like was biting his hand and I owe ya and but not hurting them and these are petting it and and the dogs it's playing with other dogs you know oh but you can raise cuz it's like you know I go to this yeah I go to and work with these this place wolf connection and essentially it's like I'm always open which one's the most wolf which one is the highest content of wolf in it like the blood and they're like it doesn't really matter it's back to the nature-nurture thing it's that there are some wolves that were raised by dogs that have more doglike qualities and some dog stories like wolves that have more wolf-like qualities right it's like the nature and nurture thing yeah that makes sense you know this guy this is what does it got rolling in feces they're really common possibly dogs ancient instinct to mask his scent which are then able to animal to sneak up on their prey without detection so you might keep so I guess dogs do it with other dog poop as well but my dog doesn't roll in my other dogs only coyote why doesn't you know I mean so anything women for Caesar tanks huge they're probably not worried about a  kite like coyotes hunt in  packs and mailer one and they surround them and ever tell you story about the guy who worked at the pet food store he worked at the pet food store also worked at a veterinarians place and they got this dog in it was one of those giant pitbulls one of those like 120 pound yeah yeah pitbulls yeah and it was covered with cuts all over its body work hard hundreds and hundreds of stitches and so he asked the owner like what happened was I don't know he goes I came home and he had gotten out of the yard he was covered in blood it was all  up because I don't know what happened and so they stitched the dog up and then they followed literally follow a blood trail up into the hills where he finds nine dead coyote he's this pitbull they lured him in and then the Coyotes ambushed him and he killed them all it's he goes it was like homie right then exactly it was like Vietnam dude he was like just necks ripped open guts torn apart arms snapped off he goes this this pitbull just killed the pitbull had a head like a fire and their muscles are in their head yeah it was a monster don't I had my ear bitten off by one yeah like it happens so fast it's I didn't I didn't feel anything I said it didn't mean to do it I felt no pain didn't mean it was like it so it does I don't have to defend it I we talked about it on the podcast right so it's like but I just don't  fast I didn't even feel it I felt no pain that's how precise it was that's what they say about shark bites then you don't you don't feel the shark bite until you realize your legs missing actually that girl Bethany thing she said it was like an orgasm it was like bliss because so much dopamine rushes to the area so that you keep fighting like it actually I think I'm comfortable about a 13-year old talking about orgasms oh god maybe I'm maybe you're maybe I'm putting that in there because I do feel myself walking on eggshells around anything sexual I wish it now you can't you a woman I would say this right now you can say whatever the  next you know women are next and they should be if women are printables know using their power to coerce people they should have you seen my Harvey Weinstein bit you haven't seen it know it Wednesday I'll tell ya Wednesday yeah for sure but I don't that's that's nonsense so Eddie got well there are I know guys that have been victimized by women at work TJ remember the amazing atheist was telling a story about the woman that he worked with his always grabbing his ass and making him uncomfortable and she was like his boss mm-hmm he was you know real socially awkward and in this up situation but that's super rare and I think that this is a balancing thing is this you know I thought was the most hilarious thing about the women's March left that people were angry these white women were wearing pink hats because not all women have vaginas because not all women have vaginas because there's trans women women of color it's both they're offensive to women of color and trans men how many trans women were marching in the women's March I die so much yeah I mean I I know they were trans based on their appearance calm down Internet I know them personally so I knew that I would tell ya I'm a comedian there was a thread on my Twitter that I wasn't even involved with where these trans people as lesbians were going at it back and forth Jesus and it was fascinating because lesbian are one of the few groups that don't feel intimidated to talk to trans people they're like they're like inoculated against that yeah and they were saying that these trans people are homophobic and these trans women can't get a truck it was crazy was 4x4 I mean for seven or eight days they were going at it back and forth but essentially the trans women this is what the lesbians were saying that they've at the violence the intersexual the intersection no the violence between women women on women violence in relationships domestic violence haha the statistics were skewed because a lot of it is trans women that were attacking women that they were in relationships with because these women that are trans women they have the same behavior that men have was this inclination towards domestic violence check and so they were saying that and she was citing statistics about how many of these women that were the the the victimizers were not they weren't they would not specify their gender at birth they were talking about their current gender and which is like a weird thing now you don't have to like you could get arrested if you're a trans woman for beating up a woman and they will say okay you're a woman right it's not your business like okay so there was a really deep that's fascinating because one of these lesbians has started this with these trans women was very educated about these statistics and was was attacking these trans women and she was saying essentially like don't go around and say because you've been a woman for a  year and a half yeah off right right and because you were just had male privilege two years ago or whatever and you've had it your whole life what was that video that that God that comedians so I ran into him yesterday Kyle Dunnigan yeah I ran into in his Twitter page I there's a thing that he did with with you know it was generous nokia coming in here there's no PC allowed at all but from the beginning and give me some volume so before you play it before you play it this is so Kyle Dunning how do you say his name down again Kyle Dunnigan did a face swap with Kim Kardashian and Caitlyn Jenner and so take it from the beginning it's it's women's movement it's our turn now are you serious Bruce used to make me touch his penis chili climaxed yeah time's up me too that was you though oh nice can't blame the vector mesh nice what's your next question what was I wearing Jace what are you wearing no his Instagram somebody sent it to me I think that's his Twitter but somebody sent it to me on this Instagram page but he does a bunch of these in their  homework yeah he wrote an Amy Schumer show really funny hate remember back in the day he that cow creamer he did that cow commercial back in the day was a chick-fil-a or something where he was like dancing with a cow do you know yeah but I just mean like it was something funny he's funny I try to get chick-fil-a yesterday why do you eat fast food occasionally on Sundays trick please delicious it's dead but I couldn't go on son terrible for you five guys I can't use on Sunday because they are open hello baby Jesus please super-religious yeah I'm gonna bortion in the chick-fil-a bathroom don't do do you think that would upset anybody are we yeah I feel like I heard we're not supposed to eat at chick-fil-a comes back old school this restaurant there look we can't that's a Mario Batali restaurant okay how can everyone stop rape people so I can eat my favorite pasta how about Monique telling everybody to boycott Netflix crazy insane I'm only giving a half a million dollars for an actor but it's like well for most people that's like insane him out I mean that's an insane amount no what's insane is her comparing herself to Chris Rock Amy Schumer you know like look she's not as famous there's a little scale and pay disparity stuff is tricky because did you get paid based on the value that you bring you know who else was going on that Kathy Griffin Kathy Griffin was saying something about I beat she did 23 stand-up shows it's twenty three standing ovations I'm a she would do a special she would be willing to do a special but she wants to make sure she gets equal pay for equal pay for women and she was making it a part of that like say no and go somewhere else you know there's so many outlets now there's epics there's whoo there's so many places just say no here's the thing they pay you what they think it's worth based on how popular you are based on how popular your stand-up isn't based on what they think so you can tell yeah I mean that's why Dave Chappelle gets the most that's why Amy Schumer got a lot yeah I was selling out arena monique's not doing that so for her to compare herself to those two people it's  crazy angry and she's basing it on her tickets like are there box office for movies that she was in like whoa whoa so you're not just getting paid that amount you're eating paid when the special airs the tickets are gonna sell because that special is streaming you know like crazy when they're circled by car you need a book we need a boy Netflix could the head of Netflix had openly Lynch someone and not one person with stopped watching that they were in trouble though with the Kevin Spacey thing they had to do something about that and they did and they did and they did having they lost a lot of money on it yeah they lost 39 million bucks yeah between that yeah yeah I saw them when we were when we were there yeah well that was where gore Vidal used to go to bang dudes but I feel like that's right but I feel like that it had to get this bad for people to be like look you know what we're not gonna hire these people because it's gonna it has to be like a bottom-line issue like I'm not gonna hire a rape because it's too expensive have you ever seen the gore Vidal William F Buckley documentary know where it details his lover no no the opposite they hated each other Oh William F Buckley was interested he was a British Conservative guy who was very popular during the day yeah and this is from the 1960s on television and they were debating back and forth gore Vidal and William F Buckley the you know liberal versus conservative but like on national television it was like these really contentious highly charged debates and it kind of sunk William F Buckley z' career because at one time gore Vidal called him a Nazi I called him a neo-nazi or something something along those lines and then blame F Buckley said something called them a  queer and I'll I'll punch your face up sock you in your nose and you'll stay plastered like lost is cool on television call him a queer on television and it was like this whoa moment and then William F Buckley saw you get to see who really is yeah you pressure when somebody snapped like I love thinking about what in 30 years or when you look back and be like you like can't believe we used to just say that you know like retard we used to just say retard the word is not the word is retarded means like to slow the growth of started ideas yeah you know like or like yeah like okay like denying someone birth control that is retard it's retarded it's like socially retarded right because it's retarding pretty slow in progress yes I don't think that's a bad word yeah what I think is a bad thing is to mock someone who has a disability right but I don't think that you're always talking about that when you're saying that word yeah I think we have a real problem with language policing okay I think we have a real problem with denying the use of sounds there's this what a word supposed to be it's like you make a noise so I understand what you're saying I understand like it there's there has to be context like I understand you're it's supposed to be a sound that you make so I can understand what you're trying to convey right and that's but if you say that's retarded and I go you mean you know that's missing a chromosome you know like it's like that would be me saying that's Down syndrome though right oh that's true you know I'm saying yeah I think it's figuring out what the etiology is of the word I did not know this happened recently someone said in a writers room she's uppity I did not know that that was a slave term we all learned very quickly that that was a term that is what it means yes the etiology of it was to describe a slave that was acting out and we learned wow I always thought up it he was someone who is like a highfalutin like you know some rich person I thought it was just someone who was recalcitrant and would not participate or who is resisting but it actually has origins and it's same with like paddy wagon is like offensive to Irish people because it used to describe drunk Irish people Irish people don't care trust me in one quarter of course it's like non Irish people are the ones that were funny that like 1/4 Irish I can't really say I'm Irish but if I was 1/4 black I be you would be would be a part of the community and then there was another one under your thumb if you have someone under your thumb it's a rolling stone song yeah but it was it used to be that was the thickness of a switch that you could hit your wife with it had to be it couldn't be thicker than your thumb yeah like there's like that is it Eddie how about your etymology much etymology of those words which I just didn't know um do you know the term fagot where that came from uh cigarettes no sticks oh that's right right and do you know why did it turn into a gay slur this is this was pissed me off on Louie CK show they used this urban myth that what it meant was that a bundle of sticks was a and so a a gay man was a because they were a bundle of sticks you would burn them in a fire that's not true mm-hmm at all did he'd know that was I don't know it's convenient to ignore how I got to do his research it's not hard what a bundle of sticks was referred to was a burden some woman they would call a burden some woman a because she was like a boy very difficult to carry around the beach Chuckie so a man who act like a woman was a fact whoa that's what the term meant that's where it came from that's the Oh idea that's the absolute origins of that term so when people say no there was a gay guy on Louis CK's show that was saying that I was it was him and Nick DiPaolo and Louie we're all playing cards together and someone said some  and you realized why that's so offensive is because you know they used to burn people there's no history of gay people being burned like witches yeah by the way even the Salem witch trials yeah they didn't burn witches they drowned them they drowned them in dogs this is how  insane the hysteria Woodrum they killed two dogs in the Salem witch trials there were dogs were witches they just live as mass hysteria you know why do you think they did that hmm why they think what looks at the drowning why the whole witch trial thing happened religious fanaticism forgot there was a late frost and this has been proven by core samples of the ground they had a late frost and when you have a late frost on wheat one of the things that happens is bacterial growth on the wheat it read it essentially a got is very similar to lysergic acid very similar to LSD um cows were dying in right and they thought it was like witchcraft well yeah there's a little bit of that but that could be another simple everyone appetite but forgot is a psychedelic and so these people were literally on acid and they were freaking the out thinking they were being hexed by witches and they're paranoid why women why didn't they think men were being witches as well I guess a couple of men mine did die but and babies they kill a couple babies Jesus Christ lost their  minds well they're on acid but I think you know given a situation when men are in a position of power which they almost always were back then and then something's happening to them they would go for the weakest thing which is probably a one or a single woman or a woman is weird anyway bitch I mean it's also just sort of annoying that now people like this is a witch hunt this is a witch hunt like without even knowing that that word is actually something to describe wouldn't man used to hunt women and now they're using it as a weight goes forward it's like I mean you know men thinking that we're like hunting them or it's some kind of like McCarthyism or something yeah witch-hunt the idea is that you're looking for something that's not really there exactly yeah exactly no you know and I guess I just don't know a lot of people who are doing that yeah I think there's a real problem we have like we said earlier about tribalism about being on training it's a mess shaming when'd you say there's definitely that going on for sure but I'm saying what I'm saying is that people identifying with all women or men identifying with all men yeah like especially men I did like I had this bit that I was doing for a while about a bumper sticker that I saw in a car it said girls kick ass no drives me nuts I hate that some of them some of them are lazy don't even I mean we're getting into this - have you seen the building - point is the point is you can never have that about men like a guy have a bumper sticker that said boys kick ass I'm Billy now pull the over yeah yeah what are you doing yeah what's what's in your car so yeah I I do have a lot of girlfriends who are conflating you know empowerment with entitlement I totally get it and I have a lot of girlfriends who think they're feminists and they're actually just assholes like I have that I just talked about this a little bit it's real right on stage yeah if a couple girlfriends who are like I need a man to respect me and I need to respect me I'm like bitch you need to get those photos of you and tank tops that say rose' all day off your Instagram before we have this conversation like you know you then earn my respect you know you don't automatically get respect just because you're a woman that's entitlement you know you still have to like watch a  TED talk and read a book every now and then you still have to like be cool and know what you're talking about so it's like you know I I there's definitely some duds I'm well there's people that are you know they're now on the team that's attacking and this is and there's a tribal like yeah this is no different than someone like the Patriots will you coconut yeah that's that's tribal - it's the same thing it's a natural inclination that people have but it's also at the same time like you know I think a lot of guys I've heard be look cool you guys hate all men and you think all men are assholes it's like for me it's actually the opposite I know a lot of really amazing men that have self-control and restraint that I'm comparing the  to you know like in your guys that say that those are just what they're scared they're guilty saying that you hate all men no I get that people are like you're bitter you know feminists that hate men like you can same thing they're tribal yeah they want to stand up for tribe mail yeah instead of just objectively looking at this and what's going on well imagine being a woman man imagine being a woman who's been working in an office yeah and dealing with this all of your life imagine being a woman who's been raped imagine being a woman who's been you know how to walk down the street past a bunch of guys they grabbed her ass and harassed her and learn about the neurological ramifications of that that go on ie like sometimes we can't speak out sometimes we freeze like you said you know and I think it's just like nobody wants to look into that research there are some women very few but there are some women that hate men there are some men I won't say very beautiful gender isn't I'm a response yeah that is a most like one person hurt me or a couple people hurt me and I need to generalize about all of them to give myself a false sense of safety I have friends that have been divorced a couple times and those are the trickiest ones because those guys like they literally like they have this idea that there's like that the women are the enemy and they take your money and they pretending like you they pretend they like you and then eventually they turn on you and they get their lawyers and they take your money and then I go what's going on with you that you keep gravitating that woman you know that's my thing it's like what's going on with you that you like you had no idea people are very different in the money is you very few people have real personal sovereignty in the beginning of a relationship interesting beginning relationship you lock on like is this gonna be the person makes me feel better about life yeah is this gonna be the first thing brings me joy this is gonna be the person that brings me lust and sex and fun and yes and then that will get resentful and this is the thing about men with money that I've always said like when a man with money is dating a woman who doesn't have money then there's this weird dynamic or I think you like it at first or some guys like it first okay the man when the man with money is dating the woman that doesn't have any money the woman is like wow this guy's got money this is amazing but then when they get married she's got money too now it's like now you're just another guy like I'm a rich lady now yeah like now I have money like gob divorces dude I'm I'm rich oh I see so and then there they get entitled the money I would say I would never take money of the guy I'm dating well you have married that's different yeah you're not I mean but that dynamic of the guy having all the money and the woman being like a waitress or something like that that's a normal dynamic yeah when it happens like men like it because like look at me you know I have I'm so advanced in comparison you know to what she had financially where she is I have all these things that I can offer her that she could never get on her own we're gonna fly to Paris on a private jet I'm gonna blow her mind you know that kind of right and then the woman marries is asshole and then next thing you know she is rich too she's got Gucci bags and a big diamond and she's driving a Ferrari and she's like you know what I don't want to suck this guy's dick anymore I'm tired I'm tired of it I'm tired of the whole thing and and then you know she's not impressed anymore because she's wealthy too so he's not a wealthy guy anymore yeah he's just a guy cuz she's wealthy I see they're now equals he doesn't have something that I can exactly access on my own I don't need him exactly I've never I don't I've not had money before and I've been hungry and poor poor I guess I get that but I don't know maybe it's just maybe things are gonna change in terms of like maybe people look back in 40 years and be like remember when 40 olds you just used to date broke 20 year olds like I mean he'll gonna happen it's still gonna happen we're biologically wired you guys are biologically wired to want to you know women that are fertile I totally get that's not just that it might be like biologically wired to want to successful touch more men that are that have their together they're more emotionally stable they're physically more together yeah are you my dad are you my dad I've done it but this is not even just a dad thing it's just a position of power like that someone is like they've accomplished something and maybe that's looking to be the new Darwinism is this is like I don't need to date a man who has power I don't really need protection right because we have alarm systems and I have a lock on my door and whatever but we're still wired to seek men that are alphas and have power and that have resources even though you know maybe I don't think that's gonna go away any time soon unless we go full socialist like we're not as memorable as we were 2,000 years ago you know yeah well we're definitely I'm sure 2,000 years ago men and women and had a much more different dynamic than in 2018 yeah it's it's getting better yeah I think overall we have less violence we have less crime we have less almost everything today than we did 2,000 years ago and I think in but I think the amount of radical change it's happening like we were talking about before between 1960 and today yeah if we go another 50 years in the future it's gonna be even more insane but it just might be like like the guy the people that thrive are the ones that are able to have some self control over their primordial brain so it's like you it's like I want a Ferrari like I would love to but it just doesn't make sense I don't want to suck that Donald sterling guy's dick dude totally likes you Morris I'd love to eat pizza every night but I'll die that's not how I'll get fat you know you'll will just start to understand the consequences of dating the person that we are sort of primally attracted to and just go like I know what that is that's what I want but I can't have everything I want cuz I'm human adult I think there's also a real this the way human beings react in the way we even think and the way what we think is acceptable and isn't acceptable change is with the culture and I think like it's one of the problems with going back to like 1960 and being upset at some of the ways people behaved because I think man that is the way people behaved back then we know better now but to get mad and a man who behaved a certain way no I'm not talking about like drugging and raping and stuff like that yeah yeah certain twenty years ago when it was acceptable sexist behavior from 1960 that was just normal yeah like I think this is just a part of the culture and people thought that's how you behaved now people are shifting yeah and I think we're and also I think one of the things that's going on this is one thing that's empowered the women's movement empowered a lot of other movements is access to information correct it's radical it's happening so fast and it's it's inundating us and we have to catch up to it it's like it's happening so goddamn quickly that we're just trying to okay what is okay now what's not okay now what can we do what can we not do right and access to each other never before have ten women all assaulted by the same man been able to meet each other right well how else would we run into here were you assaulted by that guy by any chance like we're able to find each other I'm Jamie were you talking about Steve Carell in the office was at you that was talking about that yeah what you watched the old episodes of the office which is not that long ago yeah he was such a creep but he was kind of like bumbling yeah you know like what was I think the Persepolis said where a girl shows up to sell purses and he's just like makes a big to-do just like you can have the conference room and guess what I just got this espresso maker don't make me give it to you because I won't oh you need a ride home I'll give you a ride home but you're creepy or did the right home thing was a very particular creepy thing based on today's like world right and I think that like I mean and what I know about the English version I don't know what the intention was for the American version the idea was to make him kind of polarizing and I'll make it's it makes you uncomfortable and he you know it's crazy that it wasn't that long ago yeah it was like oh but it's like you know it's like you know it's interesting because so much of this is is almost it's because it's so in tangible it's hard to explain and I think this is why a lot of guys are getting annoyed because when you get granular about it it makes us seem like we're just being crazy because so it's like you hug me at the Comedy Store and it feels different than when let's call him Joe Blow hugs me there's just something creepy about Joe Blow and there's something not creepy about you and I can't explain it and I can't tell you why and I sound crazy and manic and history that doesn't sound because that's the same way with gay guys there's certain gay guys that hug me where it's creepy there's certain gay guys that hug me on one date out anybody but there's certain guys that hug me I'm like what's up I'm a hug and it's all just warm and friendly and it's cool it doesn't matter if they're gay or not but then there's other guys that all they hang on to me a little or they'll squeeze my back a little and just get these a little little extra going on like okay I think that's what like females are kind of trying to sort of say with the more granular stuff in with the Aziz story and stuff it's like I know it sounds like I'm being crazy but I promise there's something creepy about it and I know that I don't have proof and I don't have photo evidence but I'm but in the more to talk about it the crazier I sound but I think that that is just making me the Steve Carell thing is making me think it's like a hug that lasts a little too long I had a guy once in an office right but don't you think the Aziz store is like look you don't have to try to tank a guy's life from a bad date it seems like you both 82 the round went down on each other and it's like it sounds like it sucked but then you're anonymous and then you're 22 or 23 like this is like poor judgment and here's animal T there's a lot of cruelty involved like somebody described it as revenge porn and that's it for women yeah it's an event form but it's just like look this is not these are not comparable crimes to like what we've been discussing and I don't know if and I can't speak to saying who's guilty and all that sort of information but I don't think that that this person is coming forward ik waiting it to rape I think women know that there's different a salons there's rape sexual assault assault I mean look I don't know enough about I don't know we're there but like I do know in my 20s I'm not saying as he's guilty again I don't know but in my 20s I had a lot of sex that I felt I was coerced into that was transactional sex that I didn't want to have you know and this is something we talked about in the female brain movie is that men are less able to read cues emotional cues on faces than women are how does that work it's so apparent so we have evolved to cry 4 times more easily because men have a harder time reading emotional cues on faces oh that's why women crying I'm sorry crazier because men are designed to sort of like see movement and to hunt and right you're not designed to sort of read like Oh is she frustrated or angry you know like have you ever been on a double date with your wife and like you think that her and the other I can't imagine you on a double date that's so weird thinking about yeah and you go on a double date and like you have to  talk to the guy and he's asking you a million questions about hunting and you're like just listen to my podcast why do I have to do this for free and then your wife is talking to the other girl and you think it's going well and the girl gets the car and you're like a little unwell and you're like she was such a bitch I couldn't  stand her and you're like it seemed like you guys got along great you know like has that ever happened to you my wife's not like that was pretty she's had it she just talks and she's not like if she if she thought something was bad she would let everybody know like right away well she would just it'll be obvious or just just sort of like sometimes there's like basically and we talked about the movie it's like it's just and are not as good at reading emotions on faces so it's like if you were to say like Whitney how are you and I was like I'm fine you might just be like okay she's fine let's move on a lot of guys can't understand that there's a discrepancy between what I'm saying and how I'm saying it and it's like about just reading like how muscles move on non-human faces so it's like you can look up sort of the difference and you know so I'm not defending men in that area I think that that an interesting conversation that might come up at some point is people who have autism are really gonna be in all of this people who can't pick up on social cues because so much of this is nonverbal I fear that we're gonna get to a place where we're gonna have to like sign contracts and before we have sex and stuff because you know I I know that in my 20s and I'm freezing up just talking about it is that when men made physical mansis to me I would be giving off these nonverbal cues and I wasn't saying no but my body was saying no and I'm not saying it's necessarily a guy who's supposed to like be able to read my body language but that's what was happening cuz I froze up because of my trauma response when I was scared and also we are conditioned to be submissive to men I am conditioned to feel shame if I don't a guy in a certain amount of time what I spent I thought was the opposite I thought you would feel shame if you a guy too quickly if you  about a guy on the first date you feel shame but if you there's this sort of like unspoken rule that you like kind of have to a guy on the third day what yeah Oh totally am i do not think that Jamie's never heard of this you yeah I feel like guilt and shame and I'm difficult and I'm a prude and I'm like I would I ever you yeah this might just be me but like every I mean every girl that I know that I maybe it's just my generation or something every guy out there's like all I gotta do is just get three dates in and we're in but think about all think about negotiation so just that just the tip is like something we joke about right but it is based in the idea of negotiating for sex so if someone is starting to say just the tip that means I've already said no and you'll come on how about just a blowjob and I'm like no just come on just the tip it's like we joke about it but that means that a negotiation is going on and then I've already said no and then you just get worn down and that's like transactional sex which I think women are kind of just I won't generalize about all women but I think some women are like sort of like I don't want to have that kind of transactional sex anymore and like like I feel like I'm being used as a blow-up doll and I think from what I understand that girl felt if she felt like she was like rushed through dinner and like went back and was just sort of expected to be  and I think a lot of what's happening is that men were promised something from porn and women were promised something from romantic comedies men were promised that women like wanted all the time and women have been promised that men like want to talk to us and I think these expectations are clashing so I think it's a little bit of nature and a little bit of nurture so a lot of it being media misrepresentations of actual relationships and that's the models that people are acting on maybe yeah I think it's different for every person cuz every one person has a different experience with sex everyone has a different ability to read faces everyone has a different nature and nurture everyone had different parenting and then there's a problem with like sometimes you really shouldn't be with that person then you're there yeah and you're there and what do you do I've literally had sex before just to like get out of there god I don't wanna argue with this person right now but I feel like this person feels entitled to my body and I feel shame and I'm embarrassed and like it's just all this stuff that's really kind of hard to explain and I think it probably is annoying to the guy and I just like I don't want to be difficult and I've been so gas-lit to believe that I'm difficult it just gets like really messy and then by the time you figure it out you've already had sex oh can I my parking pass back this is part of just being a human and trying to navigate your way through the treacherous waters of just social interactions and sexual interactions I didn't figure it out until I was 32 years old I wasn't able to like articulate or figure out whether I actually want to be having sex or not so like my advice to all my guy friends is do not have sex with girls in our under 30 because like I could not I didn't have the ability to even know or say what I wanted until I was but for men a lot of men feel like if you have sex with a girl who's under 30 then it's fun and you can have fun but if you have sex with a girl who's over 30 they're pressuring you into this you know relationship very quickly what's your intentions where is this going I don't know what we how we stand with our bitch Walker find another one there's tinder you can find plenty of what have you likely just wanted to calm down let's work this out I mean look we're gonna have to like start talking to each other I guess and like setting expectations I know that sounds like it doesn't it so much drama OBC but it's also it's like so funny this is totally like I'm probably shouldn't say this but I was thinking some was like yeah and then they had dinner and afterwards they whatever and she wasn't into it I was like that was already fishy I never want to have sex after dinner I think it's I don't want anything in my body after I've eaten like I need a couple I like that sex before I eat someone's going down you have to fart if we're gonna if I'm just assumed that not any sex after dinner it's not consensual but it's super normal yeah grossed out by if I just like eat chicken parmesan like I don't want your you know you know so I I just know that I've had a lot of sex in my 20s that I didn't want to be having that felt transactional that just didn't feel you know I think that you know who really wins in all this prostitutes I think if prostitution was legal see the problem with prostitution being legal is it's still shameful and still look down upon where as massage job you get to keep what you get to keep your job like no I mean like if you're afraid of sexually assaulting someone by accident or having an inter personal relationship at work and all the stuff that's going on just like having sex with a hooker like you're not gonna get fired they're not gonna report you yes but it's very problematic in that it establishes this dynamic between a man and a woman where it's very transactional yeah yeah and then if you get accustomed to transactional sex it could make it worse when you're actually it's like then your thought is just I just got to pay for it yeah why would I deal with your I just be a grown-up baby I need to get my dick sucked all the time I just mean if like men need cuz I literally was thinking about the other day I was like I would like someone to invent like a virtual reality game so that women can understand what sex feels like from like it must be so amazing I was thinking about it why do you think it's more amazing for a guy than as for because I'm like to be willing to throw away your career and take that bit of a ridge no that's not what it is no it's it's this is what the way I described it in one of my specials I said being a man is like having a small 24-hour sperm factory with a very shitty agreement with the union you got one delivery truck that's your dick yep and you got one warehouse and packages are piling up every day stacks up the more desperate you get the more you willing to negotiate yeah the more you do stupid things the nature of being a human being is men are trying to get rid of come because we're making it all day long all day long we're making come we're come factories that's what we are and and when when a man doesn't have sex for a few days you don't like I went through I did an experiment on my website like a few many years back well I didn't jerk off for a month happened like holy I'm so desperate yeah like just touching people just getting a hug your dick gets hard he's like this is bizarre like because most of time guys handle it by just jerking off you just like it's like relief you just you're you literally are backed up but you have pressure and you relieve it I don't know what it's like to be a woman but one thing I do know is you're not making a thing that you have to get rid of correct you like we have that and the difference between a guy being horny on like day one of no jerking off versus day 30 it's a you're a totally different human being Wow you're a desperate you know and men who don't ever get touched and don't ever get to have sex mmm are extremely desperate and they will do almost anything that will negotiate in very bizarre ways in order to be involved in relationships that's why you see men that are quote pussy-whipped like why are they what what is that well that's the only option they have sure these are weak people and the only option they have is to acquiesce to whatever desires and needs the woman has right you have to submit you have to submit and then she'll throw some at you like a dog it's throw some  scratch your way that's literally what happens I just thought of airborne these men had no lack of in their lives these were the men the powerful men that are going down right whenever they want to right but there's still there's beautiful wife on the planet I don't know she wasn't him I don't think he was a addict yes addict and he's a fat he's a food addict everything was a cheval addicted and power just stuffing things in his body I mean he's like to anyone whenever he wanted opium addict yeah that's how you story about Bill Cosby I used to I did this casino once and I talked to this woman who was one of the managers that casino she said Bill Cosby would make the entire staff watch him eat curry before he would perform they would have to watch him eat they would come into his dressing room and he wouldn't talk to them he would watch him eat and that's what he would do when he wanted when he was eating his food before his performance everyone had to watch him then he had someone a security guard talk him into bed at night they had to tuck him in so he laid in bed and they would talk him in and then shut the lights off and close the door like he would mental illness is that delusions of grandeur complete separation from normal society this thought that he is royalty right this is what I think I think the same behavior that Kings have you see that with dictators you see that with celebrities that are especially celebrities that again became super famous 50 60 years ago right well Cosby you know he was famous 60 years well there's some people like Danny Masterson who's young this guy's not you know the Danny Masterson one is interesting because he's a Scientology of course yeah I mean now I think he's left I don't know if a Paul Haggis to this is one of the things that they were saying about him they think that he's being set up I understand by right so yeah I know Leah Remini I heard her saying yes she was these are fake out I think Danny Masterson didn't leave like I don't think it was a ploy I've been hearing this for years and I didn't come for hey tell everybody this is my phone as if phones to let me know if this is true but I'm gonna tell you because I don't want to you feel bad about it I know totally like you know like I had heard creepy about him but it's like why did the young guy like that who can anyone whenever he wants have to do something like that and it's like I understand if you have all this the packages and the sperm building up but why can't you just jerk off why can't you just someone consensual you see that's a different thing no the rape things a different thing yeah rape thing is a dehumanizing power things it's like you you you say no you yeah I don't say no to me yeah like I'm gonna do this to you and you there's a that's not sex yeah there's something way more because if you can get hard when a woman is crying and wants you to stop and saying please stop yeah you know don't rape me don't do this you know I don't want you to do this to me tonight and you could still do that that's like some Viking  yeah really some because it's like I mean there could be some sort of obviously not to defend it but some sort of survival instinct and being able to procreate with the women who's not interested like our biology is still not checked for like overpopulation the fact that we no longer need to force ourselves upon women to proliferate the species yeah there's got to be some left over ancient horrible rape DNA because there were a lot of people that were I mean Genghis Khan yeah his genes are in some ungodly yeah I mean it's interesting like I'm just so curious how things are gonna evolve like are the people that are gonna proliferate the ones that have the most self-control whereas it used to be your masculinity or your value was defined by how strong you are about how powerful and maybe the new power is self-control and restraint well I think maybe people need to start looking at each other as other human beings instead of us versus them and I think that's part of the women's movement that's part of the men's side of it that's an issue I think we have to get past tribalism yeah I think you know Dan Harris from Good Morning America was on the podcast the other day and we were talking about in terms of politics he was saying toxic tribalism I love that turn because that that that is that is across the board an issue in this country right versus left yeah that's an issue in this country with basically everything men versus women I think we have to just look at each other as human beings and you know I'm not I'm not pro men I'm not pro woman either I'm Pro human and there's a lot of really shitty men out there and there's a lot of really shitty women correct and it's it's a real problem if we lump everybody into what women want this and yeah women are not women are not gonna do that women are not gonna lie about rape women are not gonna of course they are it's like men are gonna lie about stars people are alive great point there's a lot of people that are just poorly formed human beings and they are now a part of a righteous tribe yeah of people that are attacking this other tribe and it's like most people most women didn't March fifty million women were marching most women did not give a  most way I mean but the numbers are pretty staggering staggering but there is something interesting I think about what happens when a group of women get together because I think that at least in my experience especially like in the workplace and I and I was like trying to do some research on this and I don't know enough about it but there's this thing called I believe it's called favoritism bias and it's how women in a workplace actually compete with each other because they're afraid that the man or is going to think that they're favoring their gender so they're actually shitty it's like like queen bee syndrome or something where it's actually I've experienced a lot of competition with other women because there's so much scarcity for jobs it's like women just getting in the workforce like in the last 10 20 year this is kind of new so it's sort of like bitch this is bucking my job oh hell no so I think for women actually be on the same team not to support toxic tribalism is actually kind of a refreshing thing to just be like like we're not competing for a man we're not competing for a job we're actually gonna unite like I think there's just so people there's something that kind of healing about that at least for now yeah I agree with that I've experienced women confiding in me about other women like in comedy and they're so shitty and judgmental and critical like I've had women say things about other women comedians like what we meant you you really think she's like that yeah like yeah ah she's a hack she's terrible and it's not wait a minute wait a minute she is funny like what are you talking about now they'll get really angry about it and like like what is it like what is that like what is that like Garrity complex like there's there can only be one woman each show and it's her or me or it's like you know and that's like a primal thing of course cuz it's like I want protection from the man because whatever there's all that sort of like old primordial shed but competition between women like I have this is the first time I'm kind of not feeling that and it's kind of nice for the moment and we'll see because I definitely know even though I think that you know women my concern I don't remember who I was talking about this the other day is that basically people are just gonna stop hiring women or stop hiring mixed like putting mixing people genders up in offices because it's just too scary I'm concerned there's gonna be a little bit of a backlash that guys are something you know it's not worth hiring a woman because it's just gonna be a nightmare I mean I know a lot of guys who are like I'm not I never hire pretty assistants or I'll never hire a pretty girl to me in my office cuz I'm just too scared the way men are gonna act which i think is a little crazy and unfortunate but it's like but it's true no one wants to get sued but it's not just no one wants to get sued you change the office dynamic if you have a really hot assistant and she's walkin around with all these other guys in the office and the other guys in the office like getting their cups of coffee like when I see a guy that's like skis in on a cheque need an intern or something and you have two women that are equally qualified and one is overweight and 55 and one is 22 and gorgeous I don't know how they could be equally qualified but whatever like who you can hire are you kind of like girl this is a liability this could be a problem well the 55 year old lady might be  crazy in the 22 year old pool she might be like really interested and you know some of the things that we're interested in make it easier to talk to her or it could be the opposite the 55 year old might be wise and you know very calm to be around you can't like that's a good individual I mean if you're owned by a corporation or if you're NBC or if you're Disney or something I know there are a lot of conversations about like ooh potential liability when someone is a 55 year old interns like whoa don't you need money well that's a wrap your money yeah that's I'm just we had a PA on this show that I was on once and he was 39 and I was like wait a minute why you a you're a PA and you're 39 and he turned out to be a nut pills and he was on he was like I'm like do I had to tell people I go do you see the way he's moving like it turns like really quickly I go that guy's on speed there's a hundred percent and they were like you sure I go watch him I go watch him he's he's twitch equivalent he's always talking he can never shut the  up he interrupts conversations and he injects with these long boring stories of his own that guy's on speed 100% 39 year old intern they fired him they want to firing him like right after this one job that we did but I was like okay it was tricky though I've just I've talked to a bunch of people who are like bosses and they're like fine I'll just stop hiring women oh that's crazy man it's like oh god that's cool other because they're just so afraid of getting sued and they're so afraid of interoffice relationships and that sort of so good backfire I'm too free I'm too free to have input on this it's a it's you know I think there's a weird dynamic when men and women work together and you have a really hilarious bit about it like people working in an office together like that they the way they interact with each other it's very strange like honey badger is in a  cage which is weird yeah it's like you're this is your new family like sour with these people eight hours a day and you're only asleep for five yeah you know what I'm saying how long do you see your wife every day two hours maybe right it's weird then you're in traffic for three right so but what what are you doing your life is these people and so then your sexual situation gets weird developing bombs with them trauma bonds as messy people that never but they want to forever they just hug each other a little and they're sweet to each other forever but nothing ever comes of it but they both know yeah they both know they really want to but they're not going to so they kind of a little flirty yeah and they exchange little silly text messages and then the wife will find out this is an inappropriate emotional relationship I'm like what what does that mean I can't have friend it's not my work my work husband type thing that sort of stuff that people do have for people openly talk about their work husband this is dark I mean I remember with Chris D'Elia I was doing a show Chris Lea and we would spend all day together every day and we were like having this relationship I mean we were also acting as girlfriend and boyfriend and we were sort of super bonded and then because you spend all day talking to each other confiding in each other sharing all these experiences by the time you get home to your actual boyfriend you're like good night and then and then a month later I'm like because remember when that director yelled at me and they're like no and it's like I thought I told you you don't listen to me you don't understand me it's only because I've invested everything and that other person that all of a sudden it starts driving a wedge between you and your actual so what you're supposed to do in relationships is keep everything and hold it it's like not ejaculate achill ii emotionally it's like hold like if something crazy happens to me at work i don't confide in someone at work i have to wait till I get home and bore the  out of my boyfriend I know this dude who is a very funny guy and he brings this woman on the road with them and when he brings this woman on the road with him his wife freaks she doesn't mean like yeah he's got a woman opening act the wife is freaking do you truly think I I'm all for female opening acts obviously okay do you think he has any interest no no it just wants a I mean I support having it she's nice she's funny yeah she's a good comic yeah you know and he has her open for him yeah I used to open for yeah I mean it's totally possible yeah but you know it's that thing ya know you're experiencing this thing that she can't do she's the wife is not a comedian that's another thing I think comics also have a bond and that I feel like the outside person can never totally understand never yeah well just the way we joke around with each other yeah like you've just the things you and I've said to each other yeah if we said these things in an office like holy lots of human resources would both go to jail yeah I think you'd go to jail more than me I am the worst but thank god that NBC lost it those friends writers made a lot of progress for us because what isn't okay so there's this famous lawsuit on friends the writers assistant sued the writers in the writers room because they were something about the actresses or saying like them with twigs or I think something crazy yeah and they sued the writers assistant sued the writers for sexual harassment and said I had to hear all this disgusting and the writers won because they said it was part of our creative process well it is it certainly is and especially with comedians we have said ridiculous to each other yeah I mean like well we just like guys first of all like alan Adalia mean we've said ridiculous like about each other off like sect like about how I'd you dude do we add you bro first of all and we will do that to each other because it's how we make each other laugh that we need something really extreme and completely forbidden to make each other laugh that's correct I think that is so fascinating I think comedians we just have to go off the grid a little bit someone who watches too much porn right just we need gags and mess go running and belts around your neck conversation I think we have a certain like threshold of adrenaline we need or something yeah when I get around calm I'd say it took me so long to delineate the difference between like how to act on comics and how to act on human beings and I also think like part of the reason I'm a little manic when I first see a comic it's like a puppy seeing it's like I get to be yeah and you get to be free all day just don't say that don't say that don't say yes well it's our culture the culture of comedy stand-up comedy it's very unusual yeah like the community it's one of the reasons why I'm very protective of that community and it's one of the things that I thought was the we you know it's one of the things I've said about this whole louis c.k thing I'm like he did it top one of us to us it wasn't him not that he should do it to anybody yeah that doesn't want to jerk off in front of them yep I don't think writers or interns on a writing staff are the same right yeah it's like stand-ups is one kind of thing you just had a thing you like to beat it off pick on someone your own size in front of me he did do that to some comedians and they laughed and he thought it was funny yeah yeah there were some women so many dicks well there's some women that he did that to didn't come out and they thought it was funny but there's a difference between like oh my god what are you doing and like stop please and I could lose my job if I challenge you you know right there but nobody's doing that now right no one's beating up in front of anybody anymore I think that's over most likely still the still people scared to talk right I guess I just am curious what the what the neurology is of beat and get being able to get an erection when a girl's going stop the worst is if they didn't get an erection it's like three-quarters hard but if that's your thing if a woman got like is that like being humiliated is an aphrodisiac or a shame I think it's driven by shame yeah there's a lot of weird to that for sure I don't know there's nowhere to go like I was reading this thing about pedophiles and like I'm not supportive of pedophiles but like if you are a pedophile and you have horrible thoughts there's nowhere where you can go unless you can afford therapy where you can say hey I have some really fucked-up thoughts right and I want to a kid and because shame is the engine of pedophilia yeah and you have nowhere to go or if you Duke's go somewhere people are gonna go you you're disgusting yeah and they have nowhere to quell that shame and stop the cycle right and then if you act on it then you have more shame and then it just makes it worse and most pedophiles were molested Yeah right so it's this just this up cycle and there's no social acceptable place to go express that the way if in a a you can go hey I want to drink or I want to do drugs or whatever there's no like place for them to go yeah and it's also because it's your your thing is victimizing children like there's zero tolerance for that any where people want to kill you yeah they literally think you should be killed but there should be a place like AAA or somewhere where you go to go like but how would we know if it even works that's the problem when I know it works bullets no let's in your head but what's in your head work correct yeah I mean if someone's a kid how do you feel about the fact that if you are a pedophile that means someone molested you and you were you were a victim it's ya know it's horrible cuz victims become perpetrator so how do you break that cycle without just constantly shaming people because then you shame them into isolation and isolation is where shame thrives maybe one day we'll have some sort of a form of therapy that can literally erase inclinations that can erase survivors that takes out well that's what they were trying to do right when there was like a lobotomy yeah great bring those back in there with a drill but it's like because when you see I mean I was reading about the dark web is the deep web or the dark I'm a hundred years old but like 90% of it is child pornography yeah and you're just like there's so many like what the it makes me yeah homicidal did you see that hero cop this guy was like a hero cop got his arm blown off and he was like being and then they just caught him child porn like oh no Vegas shooter apparently had a bunch of child porn not surprised yeah you know so it's like but like to stop that cycle is just so it's like the saintly idea of like jerking off and someone being turned on by them being scared right being sexually aroused by a woman being scared there's something going on there and I don't know if it's nature if it's nurture if it's Viking the pedophile thing is also it's such a forbidden topic that no one even wants to express any sort of sympathy for those people at all you don't wanna be thought of as a pedophilia sympathizer correct correct that's almost like a thing that you can't fix like they're the the recidivism rate is so high if there's a wait if it's an addicting an addiction I mean I think it's probably a mental illness or if some sort of trauma therapy because those people are traumatized right so if you're addicted to cigarettes yeah and you go through therapy and you kick them and then you get back on the cigarettes ten years later I don't care mmm but if you're addicted to kids and then you live and then another kid gets because you couldn't keep it together anymore yeah I'm not I'm not willing to take that risk that's that becomes a real problem especially someone who has young children that freaks me the out and I like most fathers who are hearing my voice thinking about this right now I want a murder yeah I just want to take that person out of the food chain and that's you don't want to take that risk and I the one thing I would say is like people you know have a lot of sympathy for children who are molested or victims of pedophiles until they grow up you know like a lot of women who were victims of that end up manifesting as the women who can't say no or the women who are like you know traumatized and and freeze up and stuff like that but those were hyper sexual that's the other thing porn stars a lot of women that get involved in the adult industry were molested as children like a giant percentage there's no what I say it's all of them I don't want to say it's all of them because I know there's a lot of women that do it just because they enjoy it and that's totally cool but there are a lot there was there was some survey they did once what back in the day and it was some alarming number right a lot of people can never come to that to come to terms with it I was talking to a therapist who was saying something about plastics a lot of people that get crazy plastic surgery do it because they were molested and they're trying to change their face so when they look in the mirror it's not the person that got molested that's what they thought about Michael Jackson really yeah that was one of the big theories about Michael Jackson is his father abused him yeah you know my theory about Michael Jackson telling me he was gonna don't say it again tell me everything I think he's a castrato I think he had his balls removed I think that's why his voice was so high that was a common thing needs to do with singers really yeah you ever heard of castrato music but is it she and the teach whitney comes they used to do that with you know a lot of that's i know i'm not to eat cookies those are no cookies they have very little sugar and though the glycemic index on those is extremely I do not get hungry I don't understand because my body burns fat ate very little carbohydrates like this morning I eggs and fat beef so you never have like sugar spike our sugar dips yes you no need to have any spikes no I'm eating fat most of the time I mean he fat and meat that's what I eat mostly oh god I need to just regroup here I need a start it's way healthier it's way better cognitively yes is what the the I don't get mentally tired this way I take for naps a day job any news it's always so dark yeah I'm on beta-blockers - I think that's a whole other thing but you're on beta blockers beta blockers why are you on being a block I get really bad migraines and it's hormonal but I think I figured that out beta blockers are supposed to keep you from getting nervous yeah it stops like adrenaline I think from what I understand yeah and I know a lot of archers use that yeah there's the test for it yes because when you're on the like in archery competitions and then nerves will make you shaking home so I produce a lot of adrenaline cortisol at the tiniest things because I'm a trauma surg women don't I'm a spaz and so I was getting really bad migraines because of my neurochemical spikes I would get too much adrenaline and too much cortisol when I get nervous so I take two beta blockers a day mmm I'm a catch Jesus you had your balls cut off today would know it's the way you do the way you're developing they do it to a boy when they're very young there's actually recordings of castrato from like the early 1900s see if you can get that what surgeon does that kind of pull off YouTube before about how did it I'll pull it from there so like child porn oh no no because it's because the recording it gets flagged by YouTube's as being their proprietary or their proper their property and so anything that you use that someone else's stuff can get you pulled off YouTube you know like there's a shitload of people out there that have like these nature videos there's a big one we get this pulled all the time really you have people that own things pay for it like the way you would license something you could do something like that or you could give them your ad revenue but you'd have to give them like all the ad revenue from a show yeah it's insane so like if we played a clip from the office and we played it and you could see it on the show we would totally get flagged and pulled yeah and if it happens more than one time you can lose your whole channel that's insane yeah you can you could argue it that it's fair use but you don't have a license to do it and if you're making money off of it it will not be considered fair use so listen to this sound what this sound is that we're hearing and tell me what is the name of this this is a young man who had his balls removed and one of the things that happens to them as they get older they they never really develop masculine traits this guy got fat because he had no testosterone yeah no testosterone there's no balls and so they have this haunting high pitched almost female but not quite sound and it was a preferred sound so much so that they would take children and sell them off and they would get their balls cut off at a young age so they would develop to be castrato yeah this is my thought about Michael Jackson I think Michael Jackson's voice was so high it was so high-pitched and like his falsetto was so pure I really I mean no one's gonna know I mean there's no way to know but I'm a retard and I have my own thoughts these are the surgeon who did that surgery after he dies why aren't I coming forward and getting five million dollars for this story because that surgeons gonna go to jail I yeah they're saying you just took a kid and cut his balls off you can't do that it might not even be real I might just be a stupid person who has a dumb idea which is more likely I don't know I think it's a pretty good explanation I mean weird because the other didn't family didn't sound anything like that you hear Jermaine Jackson singing sounds like a man Michael Jackson never sounded like it doesn't add up yeah it was all weird it's fishy well it's also the abuse that he suffered as a child and his incredible connection of children this bizarre connection because when you're traumatized you get stunted yeah what Jamie the doctor that killed him or was and you know for killing him wrote in a book that his parents had him chemically castrated Oh like taking his race I mean that's what he wrote in a book I'm reading on some New Zealand new sub I don't know how they do that they've done that the trauma Lester's they've did they do that to trauma list has he given them the option oh so that you don't Michael Jackson chemically castrated by parents claims doctor dude this is my theory I bet I'm right I bet I'm right well you also his children were in his children right he's a heterosexual man but heinous things happened to Michael in his lifetime that actually changed or had him morph into who he thought he was one of those things according to Murray was his parents arranging for his chemical castration his testes were never removed but injections were given to Michael Jackson to maintain his voice his high-pitched voice of a child that went long beyond puberty he placed as much of the blame for Jackson's extraordinary but difficult life at the feet of his family I knew it so let me ask you is this something that stops testosterone production like what's given to kids who were transitioning and that sort of thing you're done Wow that's why he was so skinny they did that to him as a child and why did he talk can you still go still grow women are tall you're tall you're taller than me a lot of GMOs that's why no it's just different yeah it didn't doesn't stop you from growing tall stops your muscles from developing oh but and and then what does that have to do with the vocal cords because something about your vocal cords doesn't change is your voice that's why when a woman turns into a transgender man their voice becomes a different third is that legal no it's  crazy cuz that's the we talked about this in Roseanne his doctors right if that doctors right and I bet he is right if you brought about this I'll bet he's right he self-published it too what does that mean no one gave him a book to give though fact book deal to the guy who killed my that meal oh no they didn't they took it away oh did they get they lost it he lost his book deal when the thing came out about it had him thinking that it's okay for young boys to have sex with gay men not great not great not a great brand community has a different take on that really yeah they have a different take on it than the straight community the the idea of gay young gay boys having sex with gay men hmm it doesn't bother them in the same way with a lot I'm not obviously I'm not speaking for the great community and I don't want to generalize but the reactions that I've had from gay friends that talk about it say it's way more common huh well that was the Brian singer thing that Brian singer had those parties at his house where we had a whole pool full of gay kids and Morrissey also defended Kevin Spacey about it and it's different yeah young like how like how do you know if you're free nande like we were just talking about the power dynamic how do you even know you're trying to who you are you looking for a father figure are you abuse yourself it's like we just we don't know until they grow up and figure it out therapy if it was really good yeah I mean it's weird that we put this arbitrary date to like 18 right well you can go to war now you're 18 like what I figured out about 32 who I was when when she should be a lot of vote I say 50 I say really yeah I mean it's so injured it's like I mean you know why should you be a lot of Drive I drove like a mania when I was young I just never should have had a car until I was like 23 years old when should you be at all if at all yeah that's good question it's terrifying it weren't you be able have kids that's a good question too because you already do it for a certain amount of time that's right and by the time you can't do it anymore that's when you finally know what you're doing yeah I feel like I'm 35 years old I finally am qualified to be a mother and this is when you stop being physically capable nuts like you have a couple more years we could still shoot one out I have I have my shits on ice so I think I might have I might have more time but you have to find someone that you would really raise a kid with yes it's very different I have to find the perfect nanny yeah it's hard to do no I have a guy that I think is pretty a plus and if it's he's not I'll just give the child to you pretty good job raise them raise them in the forest yeah I mean and then you said it's just like it that's a very real fear I'm finally for the first time like oh god I have to get my together on that but then I get super scared about this world I'm like do I want to bring kids into this yeah I have a bit about that today yeah why would you with all the books and Medicine and people were kids okay floors that's why are we gonna have water in 20 years yeah we'll have water yeah yeah we're gonna figure this out we're panicking or freaking out but that's also why we correct things I think the technology ingenuity and I also think is ironically as it seems a guy like Donald Trump as president is going to really activate people hungry they're gonna start moving in look at this women's March right you're a big part of that is having to grab the President had to get this bad in order for us to wait to up because we're all zombies sleepwalkers he's the reason why those hats that by the way whoever is making a windfall off those goddamn now should be thanking there were people down there selling hats like me what if he's behind the selling of them ya know it was amazing to see all the commercialization of it everybody capital and also I think it's gonna make us much more appreciative of the Environmental Protection Agency yeah and then the the all the restrictions that Obama put in offshore drilling if anything goes wrong yeah cuz off he's just opened up offshore drilling everywhere you know that right yeah do you know what he's done yes I've heard that he's done a lot of really crazy things with the environment and with with state with you know whether it's Bureau of Land Management areas or I don't know which which organization he's this definitely state land that was public land that's now being diminished to state parks they're now being diminished and they're opening them up for mining they're opening them up for extraction of minerals resources yeah and all this is close to rivers and watersheds and all these different areas that are very important for different ethos lines terrifying terrifying future Delaware well there's earthquakes in Oklahoma all the time now that never used to happen and all that's directly attributed to fracking they're drilling these giant holes in the ground and pumping all this water in there and fluids and all this  these for fracking it's it's it's gonna energize people and get people to understand that the there's real consequences to just thinking about money and also how ridiculous it is that a guy who has more money than he could ever possibly spend is not only thinking about money and his thought is in his mind he's thinking about America he's thinking about people prospering and getting jobs and it's not but clearly it's not just that it's clear clearly there's some personal profit that's being extracted from all this of course yeah it's like his people he's hurt you know in look and I love Oprah she's a delight but for the left to go like let's have Oprah be present at NBC's Twitter page this is our president and counter letter no our president no no no Oprah let's hire another celebrity who isn't qualified to be the breath buddy you guys remember the secret remember the secret yeah go back and when Oprah was telling everybody you could have anything you want you just gotta imagine it it's not great to also be like hey let's have this other celebrity be President was a wonderful lady I don't have any problem with Oprah but I just think what we should have is someone who is extremely educated who is a incredibly nuanced and and well thought out opinions yes things and someone who's got a really good grasp of what it takes to run a democracy let's stop electing rich celebrities to run our country well you know you're an oil man yeah maybe it worked out if you're in the mining industry and then it's like just tricky it's like the idea of being like I don't think Oprah should be our next president you're sexist like jesus christ no I'm not it's like we should be able to say we don't think certain people are qualified stop yelling at me do you read your comments and Instagram should I just stop no never you know very very rarely very sometimes we'll look in and I'll see someone that's a dick and I'll just block them it's like what because I try to like engage and like try to like see what's going on but the kind of is just too insane it's not worth it you just put out good things try to be nice and is that a crazy person or is that a person that masquerades as being sane and then behind closed doors is crazy I could be bolt makes it both could be both did you ever hear about that guy that got fired from reddit and he was saying awful on reddit and posting all these terrible things and they found out his personal identity and they went after him and then got him fired from his job and it devastated his life thing I was married with kids only life completely fell apart yeah people enjoy being a anonymously they enjoy it one of the things that I found on the Instagram if someone says something really particularly heinous you go to their page they're almost always private they almost always have like a blocked page because they're cowards there's just a lot of like very deeply unhappy people that will lash out at anybody that's in the public spotlight like you I'm gonna see a crazy woman crazy question okay if a man this happened to someone I know if a man is engaging with relationships with other women on the Internet as a character is it cheating no just these piggies having a character roleplay yeah I'm well who is an artist is your writer no no like ended in of you know just sort of pretty adrenaline free job yeah he's probably completely bored out of his mind and that gives him a charge is it like a video game because I was like this feels kind of like a video game in a little what in a little bit of a way it is it's a role-playing yeah you know it's like a simulation right in the little way it's just being deceptive right maybe it's fantasy wishes he was someone different mhm yeah like is that if your wife is online as a different person engaging with men pictures of her own oh that's Mike it's weird dicey right  flying through the air literally you know who's here this is what's gonna win flashlights I wonder if the sale of flashlights is gonna go robots that's no it's gonna win what sex robots sex robots totally they're closing in to your point about the right do you think that that also works a muscle of dehumanizing yes yeah yeah and also changes your reward system like instead of like learning to be an interesting charismatic person who's caring and kind and reaping the rewards of real relationships with people that care about you and you care about them and understanding real true love right instead of that you this robot I cannot like is it cheating if he a robot like I can't have that fight I can't do it did you the robot or not I can't have that fight I can't hear this what do you know that what do we did you the rock tell me the truth look me in the eye and tell me you didn't with your you I can't is a robot bad but a fleshlight okay yeah cuz there's no head if there's eyeballs it gets very dicey yeah weird fake robot eyes skinnier than me is she prettier than me I just want to make sure the robots have wrinkles couple crow's feet giant anime eyes yes I don't want them being too it we got to make sure these to make sure these robots aren't too pretty they got to be ugly it's not gonna happen  they're gonna be perfect I don't like this one bit you posted that thing in that robot chomping see that episode of black mirror know what metalhead we're doing oh my god the new new season of black mirror is amazing insane and one of the episodes has a bunch of robots and they're going after people it's called metalhead I don't wanna say anymore okay it's terrifying because it's very realistic and incredibly realistic and and probably represents something that's gonna exist in the future or maybe it's gonna the other way I'm gonna be like baby can you just the robot tonight maybe that's when you know it's over as a team I send him over the robot please don't maybe you'll allow him to robots but the robot has to look exactly you have a spare the problem is that we'd get the robot we'd ordered it would come in and be like is that what I look like I've had to disinfect and you'd put your hand up and just like a mirror it would put its hand up with me though it would have to age it would have to get older when I get older it have wrinkles and gray hairs and they're all Asian did you see the woman grace woo at the body a
