I've four three two hello Sam Harris hey ma'am good to see ya happy to be here I listen to your podcast with Jack let's just get right into the jump in the jak stuff yeah because I listened to your podcast with Jack and I found something very when I did my podcast with Jack first of all was not anticipating the blowback that I received it was stunning but he what what I thought was I was gonna have a conversation with this guy be fun see what it's like to run this gigantic network that helps people communicate okay Jamie helps people communicate and distribute information worldwide what does it like to start something like that up and have it become what it is like how have you managed to try to keep up with it and what of the headaches Ben and apparently people online particularly the people that want to comment about this all they wanted to know about was censorship and that was an issue with me there was a question with me but it became a far was a far bigger question for people online they felt like that I tossed him softball questions and that I didn't press him yeah and then I listened to your podcast and one thing about Jack is very smart guy very nice guy but he talks in a very slow and methodical way and when you ask him a question he takes these routes and if you don't want to jump in and press him like you're in this weird situation where he's not totally answering your question but he's talking about the same subject that you talk to like for instance you brought up Louis Farrakhan right like how was Louis Farrakhan and good standing on a platform and someone like you know fill in the blank Milo yeah innopolis or Laurel umer or whoever it was they get kicked off he never got to that he went around and around and around with you and he recognized this after the podcast I received a lot of blowback he received a lot of blowback so I contacted him and he said he would be more than happy to come back on again and address all these things and I said okay what I'd like to do is address specific instances of people being censored and he said okay what I'll do is I'll bring in someone from the company that's in charge of that stuff right so I'm starting to put together a pick sure of what it's like to be a CEO of something as big and he's also a CEO of square he runs the cash app there's a lot of stuff going on there right so it he's obviously busy how much day-to-day involvement does he actually have and who gets censored and why they get censored and how much is he willing to share about that so we're gonna find out in the next follow up podcast but I got accused of everything from being a shill to being a cock to being and there's also an issue that you've a managed to avoid wisely so of advertising the cash haps an advertiser on my podcast so because the cash apps and advertisers are on my podcast right the man had you by the throat exactly I think that ask all those great questions that were queued up the reality is those are the questions I would have asked now that's hard to say because no one's gonna believe it but those are the questions I was asked and I tried not to be too confrontational with aghast but in hindsight I probably could have pressed more particularly on people like Kathy Griffin calling for daxing for the the kid with the maggot hat on with a Native American there was there's a quite a few but I noticed that well what was your experience like with it yeah so it's interesting cuz you and I have we had different interviews because there were time differently I mean this is interesting topic cause this opens the door to all the ways in which our podcasts are different I mean they you stream live I sit on my podcast for at least a week sand in Jack's case it was like two weeks before I released it so I did my interview with him before this flurry of interviews with him came out I mean there's a rolling stone interview there was a I think only well I think maybe a Huffington Post interview would come out but basically there was nothing out there so I had no real examples of how he dealt with these questions or how he talked yeah yeah well I mean slow talking is not a problem for me because I'm one of the great slow talker so so we're in a groove there but he III didn't know what his boilerplate was and and how he would he would answer any of these questions and your podcast came out before mine did but mine what mine was before the Covington high school Catholic know what Circus happened right so the the real missed opportunity for me was just a sheer matter of timing like I you know because the Covington thing puts such a fine point on everything that's wrong with Twitter and the way journalism interacts with it right it was it just you know I think it was Farhad Manjoo wrote an op-ed in The New York Times saying Twitter is destroyed journalism and and and it was not a crazy op-ed in fact after the Covington thing and the holy and Kathy Griffin would have been a perfect example to talk about it like we you know why is she still on if she's calling for the dog scene right yeah but you know I I think I had a substantially similar interview with him that you did because he's there's two things one is he's great at sort of pure wedding around the the the sharp pointed question of you know what is the policy and why why are you applying it in this seemingly disparate way and it seems to skew politically in one direction all the time right but you know I think you also I mean you know I did I think you did naturally we cut him some slack in that he's the CEO of these two corporations he can't be expected to actually know what happened in every one of these micro cases like I think I brought up the case of I think her name is Megan Murphy I hadn't even heard of her but that's the lesbian woman she was like a feminist who said sort of the wrong thing in the transgender space she said something like men are not women right and she got banned and a life or to know it I think it was temporary but you know sorry I raised it and you know he obviously can't know exactly what happened in that case or at least it would be surprising to me if he knew so the fact that he doesn't have his finger on each one of these cases and what the what the rationale was and he has this sort of generic answer that what you're seeing you know in public is not necessarily what we're seeing in fact in virtually every actionable case is not what we're seeing in private with respect to how these people are opening opening multiple accounts and doing seemingly nefarious stuff behind the scenes now whether that is true I don't know but I mean I can just say that Jack seemed one I liked him and he seemed unusually open to talking about anything I wanted to talk about it sighs I saw one allegation that got ahold of you was that you know you must have been constrained by you know the topics you couldn't touch in advance you must have had some agreement with him in advance you know it didn't happen with me right now I should address that there was no no discussion whatsoever about what was off-limits yeah no nothing and he asked for note so in my case I tell all my guests and this is the difference between you streaming live and and me not I tell um I guess listen if at any point in this interview you put your foot in your mouth or I put my foot in there we can edit it right like we I want you I want you to be totally happy with what you say over the next two or three hours mm so if you have to take something again take it again and you know we'll just hide the seams as we go now that virtually never happens right and in Jack's case it there wasn't even a wrinkle like that so but you know I just you know I I recognize it's a high-wire act for a lot of these people especially for someone's running to publicly traded companies right and you know I also want to invited him on I said I said Jack you know yeah we were DM and on Twitter I said listen I promise I'm not gonna make you smoke a blunt on video and that got him so I don't know how you got him but I didn't try to get him just looking but I didn't even think about it yeah we weren't drinking we were just talked maybe we'd been better if we were drinking because it did seem very stiff I listened to it after the fact and I mean I get from their anticipation why it would be disappointing I just thought it was kind of boring I thought my podcast with them just wasn't very good I sometimes do too many podcasts and when I sometimes do too many podcasts I think I run low on juice and I'm not as I don't know I'm not as engaged or I'm not as fired up about it and maybe I just should have definitely should have prepared more for him but I really thought it was just going to be a conversation about what it's like and I thought that would be really easy to do yeah because it's such a unique position to be running something like Twitter but he you know I don't know if he was evasive and because he didn't know the things or because he didn't want to talk about things but there was things like he didn't know exactly why Alex Jones was ultimately banned he didn't he couldn't recall or didn't know no is that because he couldn't recall is because he didn't want to talk about it or is it because he didn't remember it I mean I don't know I mean you'd have to you have to be inside his head to get that answer yeah I mean he's clearly got a a very practice line that he uses to answer these questions and because I you know I know what it's like to have boilerplate now you know I've been a book on a book tour and you're just basically getting asked the same questions again and again and here he's getting asked fairly pointed questions about you know where Twitter's going and he's got you know I don't think this is dishonest I just think but it has this amazing ability to close the door to further inquiry because he gives you the full maiya culpa right up front you ask like what's what's the situation with you know the seemingly asymmetrical banding of people and he'll say you know yeah we really I mean we got to get much better at communicating our process we're not nearly transparent enough this whole thing is in disarray and my job is to fix it right so it's like a global you know we're fucked up and we're gonna get better I promise you right yeah and there's do any good for the people that already band but there's not a lot to get right on that right in an interview yes so it's it worked whether you know I don't think it's nefarious I think it could well be totally honest but it does have this this effect of you just keep reaching a certain kind of brick wall that you know was gonna be there you know yeah that's I felt that too and I didn't didn't really get that very well and that was a big part of the blowback but then the blowback was accentuated when they found out that he sponsors me as the catch app is one of his businesses and it sponsors the podcast yeah yeah well I had a very similar result and I don't have that that problem so as you know that I don't think that diagnoses your situation at all but it's very interesting the difference between these business the business models under which we run our podcasts and just the different I mean just every choice you make and how to produce a podcast I essentially have made the opposite one you like streaming live like this mm-hmm the fact that you're so that this is just all very interesting to make so I'm kind of a reluctant student of digital media now because I've just kind of stumbled into this Wild West that you know you and large part have invented right I mean this podcast in space was nothing and now we've got Spotify you know buying up and it's like a land grab for audio yeah that we were talking about that before the podcast they just purchased some company was it given what is it called yeah for some ungodly amount of money yeah like two hundred million dollars not gonna spend five hundred this year or something and so it's it's this we're all just making this up and you know I'm making and you know I've just released a meditation app which is a different business model still and so now I have these kind of two parallel digital businesses happening in my life and it's um it's just very interesting the decisions you make or a force to make and the consequences of it and so like the fact that we're having this conversation live you don't even have to think about whether you're gonna edit this right because it's like it's streaming live and you know we're gonna when we're done we're gonna turn off the mics and walk out of here and your job is done with my podcast that's not the workflow at all and I saw I I totally envy this this approach that you have but for a variety of reasons I feel like I can't take it in in my life and so it's means but it is very different it dictates many choices you know down the line which I mean there's there's a positive and negative but it's you know the positive is what you hear is what we got and we're done after we turn these mics off and that's and that's not you know that's not how I podcast there's also the visual element of it and the visual element of it and initially was almost like a side effect I mean we we first started it out visually but then when it started going to iTunes the iTunes aspect of it became the focus the audio version of it rather became the focus but then we decided to stream on YouTube and put it up on YouTube and but it was totally not profitable it was just for for a goof like oh we'll have the video up why not some people like video it was one of those things but then you realize ultimately that YouTube becomes a viable source of revenue and then it's also the a lot of people like to watch it you know and they also like to watch because they can comment under it that was the other thing that came out of the jak podcast we got into a controversy about comments and about how comments are deleted or how they're shown in hidden and what happens because people were accusing Jamie of deleting all the derogatory comments that we don't touch any we don't we don't delete any of them we don't do anything to them we just leave them up there and it's a mostly a cesspool but I mean even even on a good podcast there's a lot of crazy shit that happens on these things but from what we think and Jamie correct me if I'm wrong you think that what's going on is that people are marking other people's posts as spam yeah there's that and then Brandon also has the theory that a lot of alt-right people are targeted by the algorithm that YouTube uses like in in in one case there was a guy who had a Pepe the Frog avatar and he said like his his comment immediately went to spam and that the other thing is that the comments are curated depending upon who is watching it and what account it'll be they'll be different sort of yeah they'll propagate different comments to the top it's not a this you can actually change it if you if you prefer to see the most new comment like your own personal YouTube when you're watching you you as a viewer yes or user of YouTube have to make that actual yeah so that exact conspiracy theory just heightened the whole thing right okay now they're deleting negative comments like look I don't like doing bad podcast but I will be the first one to tell you when I think a podcast sucked yeah that podcast was definitely disappointing it wasn't good mine wasn't good it was like I said when I listened to it was like god this is kind of boring yeah this wasn't it wasn't juicy there was nothing he we didn't get a flow it wasn't like he and I were just shooting the shit having a good time well to take that one decision so you have decided to make video a main component of this podcast so it's still probably a small percentage of your actual listens not anymore not anymore it's it's gotten to it's almost 50/50 awesome cuz it's closing in on that it used to be like ninety ten yeah yeah okay so you so I have it I don't have a video component and so I just put audio on YouTube but I put absolute no energy into YouTube I mean that may one day change but because I don't I don't care what's happening on YouTube right so I never see the comments and whenever I look it is as you say a cesspool it's insane I mean YouTube's it's just skews massively right it's skews just massively male and it's probably skews very young too so you have it just solely just like millennial alt-right craziness right it's like like as I say these sentences your YouTube page is just blowing up with hate for me you got a bunch of you know Millennials thumbs up their asses just whinging right yeah yeah older people too well yeah but I mean it's gotta be younger than most of where well first of all I'm not even seen most comment threads they could possibly respond to anything I put out there now right so I got out I don't even look at my ad mentions for the most part I spend maybe five minutes a day looking at that's healthy what's coming back to me but and you were actually helpful in in reformat in my brain on that on that topic but so because I don't see any of that stuff I mean maybe I'm getting a lot of pain for my Dorset interview but I don't even know about it right and so I'm not having I don't feel like I have to course-correct in response to anything now and and in large measure it is a consequence of just this decision that you know I inadvertently made that I'm just I don't have a video component to my podcast at the moment and so I'm not I'm not spectating on you know that the feedback on YouTube well the feedback thing is interesting because we were just talking about this before the show that with feedback and comments on YouTube essentially anyone can comment and if you don't go banning people from the channel which we don't do it's not we wouldn't do if someone was totally a piece of shit but we don't so you essentially have this open forum so it's like almost like a message board where people you just sort of comment and it's unlike Twitter in that regard because Twitter just you know you get abusive and shitty on Twitter they just get rid of you if you get abusive and shitty on Instagram or on Facebook Facebook they'll just get rid of you but if you are on YouTube and you're in those comments you could kind of get away with more so I would imagine that people that don't appreciate censorship and want to just just fucking spew out whatever's on their mind would be the place that they would go especially if it's the same product essentially the only thing different and this is a thing where it got confusing with the YouTube people versus the audio people with the audio people it's very obvious that the cash app is a sponsor because it's we say it this prod cast is brought to you by the cash app whereas in YouTube they're like ha they're hiding the fact that the cash apps a sponsor right we talked about it during the podcast itself but we don't put the ads on YouTube we there's ads that YouTube puts on but we put the ads on like after the show is over I'll read the ads and we'll insert those into the audio and that will go up to iTunes and RSS feeds and all that stuff so the stuff that's on YouTube it's abbreviated in a sense that especially the live one doesn't have anything so like this has zero ads and then the ones that will be posted on YouTube later it'll have YouTube ads right so that's what this so there's a couple of conspiracy theories in that regard there's also apparently an emerging conspiracy theory about that Jack was trying to pump up Bitcoin because they have some sort of a Bitcoin deal have you heard this one I read that but I get it from what I saw it's not higher than it was at any point it's still right around $3500 so if there was a pump and dump scheme of some sort than like it should be sure like provable on the blockchain I guess I don't know yeah I don't understand that but is there any other component to it I don't know I don't know I don't know where that was coming from this yeah I don't know what did it yet you've all he said was that well the cash app sells Bitcoin so we talked about Bitcoin I think you know that you can buy and sell Bitcoin through the cash app I should say I think he said something about blockchain technology rendering everything permanent online and this that was something different yeah but that I think that's in regard to comments into anything blog posts blockchain is essentially gonna have everything that's online forever but there's so many fucking conspiracy theories about all this stuff it's it's fascinating and as you know we were talking about earlier with your foot the way you do yours you used to use patreon and now you use your own website after the sargon of akkad incident when you nobly stepped back away from patreon now or not so nobly whatever what you think sargon of akkad yeah well it's not even that it's a yeah yeah well there's so many misconceptions about what happened there and my you know I tried to clear them up on my podcast but yeah there's an interesting implication to not taking ads and I think what's happening and this is much bigger than even podcasting I think I've been sure to know what you feel about this I mean you have you are the quintessence of this successful ad model in in podcasting right like this is you it's working fantastically well for you and for people like Tim Ferriss and you know probably Marc Maron I mean there's it's there's some because it's kind of like a winner-take-all thing happening in the space where ads are working great and I am a really also a highly successful example of the the support model it's like the PBS model the NPR model and what's weird is that I can't like that we you know you and I are both surrounded by people who have podcasts want to have podcasts and are asking us for advice about how to succeed and how to monetize and like I'm not even in a place where I can recommend my model to anyone else right because it's it's a very you know it's it's very hit-or-miss I mean I had just happened to have developed an audience that will support my work and you had developed that audience previously ironically enough on YouTube there's a lot of you - well yeah just debates random coding people putting my content on their YouTube channels yeah the mostly debates right yeah and as a you know as no author but it would mean it was just up the podcast grew and I had this sort of forced choice where am I gonna go the the the ad route or or not and I found that I may have two things to to say you know fairly strongly against ads but what really only one of them applies to me and I don't think it applies to you or Tim or anyone else I just felt personally I couldn't use ads because of such as what my platform is and the kinds of topics I'm engaging and it just didn't work I mean there was nothing highbrow enough where I felt like my credibility wasn't getting subtly on bye-bye shilling for to me be something that I just legit loved and it could have been the Oxford English Dictionary you know like you guys is the best dictionary in the world you guys should use it I still couldn't do it and I might ride it with the only thing I took on as a sponsor was audible and I did that for some weeks and then just you know I loved audible but but it just felt wrong and so I decided to just experiment with a different business model and it's working for me but it's I don't think it can work for most people and I've you that as a problem and a thing that I I think is is interesting is that there's that this is much bigger than podcasting so you have like you have Facebook on the one hand which is just a a totally free platform where the users don't even realize that they're not the customers there at the actual product right the users the users are having their attention sold to advertisers and it's this enormous business and on the other end of the digital spectrum you have Netflix which is just a stark paywall right and there's no way in but to pay the subscription and you know that's and you know Netflix could run ads and get more money if they wanted to but they're you know they're not doing that and presumably won't do that and I'm hoping just generally speaking that the digital future looks much more like Netflix and much less like Facebook and because I see what ads has ads have done is they've anchored everyone to the illusion of free everyone expects their digital content for free except in places like Netflix right so like if when you release a comedy special when you really release your next hour and you sell it to Netflix I would imagine there are very few people in your fan base who are thinking well fuck Joe Rogan why didn't he just put that out on YouTube right why is this on Netflix they they sort of understand that this piece of content is belongs on that shelf and that if they want it they have to subscribe to Netflix whereas if you did something slightly different but you know functionally the same if you put it on Vimeo and charge people five dollars or whatever in a Vimeo on demand I think you'd get a lot more pain right you people would say well fuck you you creative bastard like if you're already doing great just release your stuff right yeah and I've you that as a problem it's like it's like a psychological problem people have been anchored to the ad subsidized model more or less everywhere and they expect everything for free and in my world I'm trying to just continually Brook that expectation and push people into a different sense of you get what you pay for and and the so that the hybrid model I've created for myself is I'm putting more stuff behind a paywall right I mean it's so that this is it's not just pure sponsorship of otherwise free content but I'm very personally I'm very uncomfortable with the idea that if someone actually can't afford it they can't get access to my content so I just tell people if you really can't afford the stuff behind my pay wall or you really can't afford my meditation app just send us an email and we'll give it to you for free right so yeah I've heard that I was like this guy's crazy I mean it's actually it's actually in the pricing in the App Store for my meditation app it's like there's the pricing and then below that there's if you can't afford this you know here's that here's the email address I think that's fantastic and so that's I'm just free yeah I'm sweating it that way but I'm raising prices it's like it's like because I think everything is too cheap in the digital space I think I think we're anchored to I mean there are people who will spend five dollars a day on a cup of coffee every day for the rest of their lives and yet if you told them this podcast or this app that they that they say is incredibly valuable to them is going to cost them five dollars a month they they feel raped right you know so it's you know and I completely understand it because I know what it's like to hit up a wall and think I can't get my credit card out again I'm not gonna pay for this I'm gonna find this information somewhere else so I we've all been anchored to this thing and you know something is gonna win in the end I mean I you know I think at some point you know it's gonna look much more like Netflix or much more like Facebook and I mean I'm throwing my lot in with the former but you know it's it the Wild West well the Netflix things different because Netflix has programs that cost a lot of money to create this podcast was very easy you're my friend I call ya pay you want to do a podcast you come on over here I mean obviously we had to pay for all this equipment but other than that it's just and bandwidth and rent and all that stuff other than that just goes up right whereas you do a comedy special across hundreds of thousands of dollars you have to secure a venue you have to hire staff I mean it's a big deal yes it's that's and that's an easy thing in terms of like bang for their buck what Netflix will get out of it if you do a television show I mean my god you you you need to hire hundreds of people there's wardrobe and makeup and set and there's writers and producers and executives and everybody has to go over the script with a fine-tooth comb it's incredibly incredibly strenuous there's a lot going on when you create a television like stranger things or something like that I mean you have so much special effects and so to ask for that for free seems B to me seems ridiculous well yeah yeah but but except the I mean so I'm kind of splitting again I'm running on two tracks here an app is much more like a television show surprisingly than it is like a podcast but yes but even if it's just a podcast if you want to build something if you want to build a media company like either like like let's say you were let's say you were asking for support for this otherwise free podcast people don't know what your aspirations are I mean maybe you want to start a podcast network right maybe you had you're trying to build a business that is that maybe you have massive payroll expenses that you know so the expectation that the product should always be free closes the door to any of those aspirations if in fact you have them and you know it's like I mean it's very interesting psychologically because so I so I have I've created this network of support for my podcast but I see people do calculations that they would never do in a more transactional space that they were just let's say buying my next book right so like for me offering a free podcast and then saying if you find this valuable you can support it right that for you know from the side of being a creator of that content it feels like the the most transparent interaction possible because a person can listen for free for as long as they want to just discover how valuable this and then they can support it to the degree that they find it valuable whereas if I'm selling you a book you can't even read the book before you before you buy it or you have to make the decision to buy it and I'm trying to convince you to buy it because it took me all this time to write it and and you know you're you know it's it's it's transactional with but with a podcast people make calculations that they would never make when they're just figuring out whether they want to buy something like like I'll and it's really a long line to what you just described people say well how much does a podcast cost to produce right like if I knew what you were spending the money on and what it costs you to do this podcast well then I would support you right but they're never saying how much does it cost to write a book and if I knew what you were gonna spend the money on once you once you were once once I bought this book then I would know whether or not I wanted to buy it you then want the book or you don't right so the problem with the support model and this the part the problem with patreon and everything else is that it engages this sort of the philanthropy charity side of the brain right and people are worried about what you're gonna do and how much it all cause like how much does its might cost right yeah like that that's that's a question that someone is asking when they're donating it wasn't in donating and the problem there is they're not understanding you know just the opportunity cost like I you know I have to decide how to spend my time am I gonna spend 90% of my time on a podcast well that if so that closes the door to virtually everything else I can do right so it's you know it has to become a viable business and so I mean I I've recognized now that I'm you know to some degree going against the grain of human psychology in asking for support and now I now I feel like I'm gonna ask much less and I'm gonna tell people what the business model is and and you know and still like and remind them of it but I'm personally I'm gonna go more and more than in the direction of putting stuff behind a paywall and if people want it then they can support and so it's it's a it's kind of sort of Netflix the ultimate version of it would be if it were Netflix that would also let you get it for free if you really couldn't afford it right that I mean that that that's the guilt for a business model that I'm converging on now I like it I like how you're thinking and I'd like the ethics involved in it and I think it's a great thing and when you set it on your podcast I was shocked but it makes sense coming from you my thought is I'm in negotiation or in discussions right now and I talk to you about this too about building an app and what I want to do with the app is have a set amount of money that you pay per month if you want to sign up for the app and you get the podcast with no ads right so you could either get it from iTunes or whatever your Google Play or Google podcast or you can get it from the app and if you get it from the app you pay X amount per month and you get the podcast with zero ads and it'll stream live I'm gonna figure out how to do both of those things my thought going into advertising when I when I first did the podcast I've been doing the podcast now for nine years when I first started doing it there was no ads for the longest time it just cost money it costs money too for bandwidth it cost money to put it but I was doing it for fun and I didn't care and I revenue was coming from other sources a few years ago I decided what I was gonna do was because I was getting ad well the first ad request was a Facebook was the fleshlight rather and you were the first person to request I killed I did not have the fleshlight on your pocket yeah the first podcast that we did what can pre-madonna Sarah Mary Wow has it made sense they were disgusting ads too we would get ridiculous and and be really silly and those ads it was just the juxtaposition I just just knowing that the mic would go hot and then you know 15 seconds before it would still be ringing in their ears that you know if you want to jack off with this fantastic device you know here sam harris neuroscientist but moral philosopher the fleshlight experienced some pretty significant positive impact from that I mean their business went through the roof right because of the podcast I mean they really sold a shitload of flesh lights where they told me like some ungodly number like 50% of the flesh lights they were selling was cold were drogon that's not that I don't want to picture too much the armies of people using their product you know so word got around and then as the podcast space started expanding then advertisers tentatively were dipping their toe in my philosophy and it's still hold I was aware that's like two thousand six or seven or you know Jamie 2012 12 yeah I wasn't the first time I was on here was 2011 well did the end of 2009 okay doesn't end was all right you were probably on before yeah you're probably on around 2010 or 11 there's no other ads other than the fleshlight with you yeah and then the fleshlight dropped off when we started asking for more money they're like yeah I think we hit the point of no return but my philosophy getting into advertisement was I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want to do a hundred percent and have no impact whatsoever on the content of my podcast like whatever advertisers that I choose whatever advertisers that I make deals with they have to understand that there's no way I'm changing the content of the podcast and if I lose them I lose them I don't care and that was the thought process going in so I never hit a snag like this cash app Jack Dorsey thing before where people think that the reason why I was easy with him was because of the fact that he sponsors the podcast it's a very obvious conflict of interest right but but people have to realize that if they churn out off your podcast you've got just an endless number of advertisers way too many lines yeah so I mean the cash logic component it's like it's just one way of looking at it that they they buy a lot of ads they do buy a lot of ads we do have a good relationship with them but I don't need them if they went away I have too many ads and that sounds gross to say but it is a fact I have many more ads than I have spots for ads so if they went away would not hurt me at all financially because I put a limit on how many ads I do per podcast I also don't ever interrupt a podcast with an ad I don't do that and because I don't do that that cost me money but I just feel like the experience of listening to a podcast unbroken is so much better than listening to a podcast we'll be right back well this word from Casper mattresses you know it just it feels gross but in the beginning I'm like look you know where it is you can fast-forward but maybe you're into this stuff maybe you need stamps.com maybe whatever the fuck you need those are the ads they pay a lot of money I'm gonna take that money and I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want and if these guys decide oh you smoke pot or you're too controversial or you talk about this or talk about that we're gonna drop you okay that's my philosophy in and I've lost ads I've lost bonzers okay I don't care but if I lost the cash app because I was too hard on Jack Dorsey or if Jack Dorsey comes back and I'm too hard on him in grilling him about these people that have been censored I hope he doesn't but I like him it's nice yeah I want to know what the fuck's going on there in fact I'm having Tim Poole come on tomorrow Tim pools and investigative journalist independent journalist who was used to be with Vice and he knows a lot about the censorship issue with YouTube or with with Twitter rather and he knows about YouTube as well but with who is censored and why who is removed who's bendy platformed why they've been deep platform and where the inconsistencies and you know where why why is it skewing so heavily right where the people on the right of the ones who are getting banned the people on the left are getting away with a lot of crazy shit so we're gonna we're gonna get into the weeds with that and if the cash app hears that and they decide to drop me as a sponsor I don't care yeah I really don't care this is a major source of income for me but it's only one source right it's one of the things that being a stand-up comedian working for the UFC and having a podcast and then have a podcast with ads on YouTube and and having ads that are on the regular podcast itself I'm free in a sense - I have plenty of money it's not whether or not I'm starving or worried about paying my bills I'm free to do whatever I want to do well also I should be clear like I don't think because this can sound totally sanctimonious and it's not intended that way I don't think my scruples around at reading it as on my podcast apply to you or Tim faris or many other people I mean like Tim is the ultimate example Tim is somebody who's brand on some level is what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go out there and find the best shit in the world right you know the best shirts the best workout equipment to us and I'm gonna tell you about it so I want to know what Tim has found right so Tim if Tim is reading an ad for something you know that is totally brand convergent for him and I think you're very much in a similar situation if you're talking about on it or whatever it isn't it's your own you own part of on it right yeah so it's like I should also be clear that I say no to a lot of ads that I don't want there was one there was a uber for babysitting I was like get the fuck out of here what are you crazy actually said that got recommended to me by somebody but it sounds like sounds like Craigslist for babysit sounds like a disaster waiting to happen there's been a few that I've said no to like quite a few some of them that are just boring I'm like I'm not reading that I'm not selling that that's stupid but also you're a comic who can send up ads I mean I think bill burr does this weird kind of trash as the ad as he's reading it because that he lost naturebox because he told people to go eat apples yeah yeah he's like Oh eat a fucking apple so it's I mean that's toad and that's something that's a tool you have in your wheelhouse that has effects down the looks like it's one reason why you can stream live without really worrying about it and I feel I can't like so is like me yeah at the end of the day like if things go completely haywire in your podcast you can say listen I'm a fucking comic what do I know right you could like you can just you can just pull the ripcord yes and you're fine right right I can't do that right like so I guy you can't say I'm a more yes yeah so I mean I can and there's certain circumstances where I should but it's like I should avoid those circumstances yeah right yes so you know I have to prepare more for podcasts and I feel like I personally it's it's as much as out of concern for my guests as well like I just you know this is a high-wire act but I want a net normally so that people feel free to be totally unguarded because they know that if we have a spaz we can you know we can you know even uttering spaz attack will screw some people's careers we actually had a conversation about a podcast that I talked to you about one of your podcasts we said that you actually started it over yeah started let's try this again let's just start from scratch yeah yeah I mean I maybe I I think it would I don't think it would be sporting to say which podcast that was but yeah so I had a podcast that went completely into the ditch for the first half hour I mean just brutal and and I said listen there's a really there's a good conversation for us to have here and now I know how badly this can go all right so like now I know just where the track is I have to struggle to keep the Train on and so we're gonna reboot we're gonna start again and let's see what happens and you know the podcast was was not perfect and I got some criticism for it but people didn't understand that we were like you know we had a you know we had I had seen the pit of alligators and didn't want to fall in well it made more sense though when you told me that because I'm like okay it was heated before you even got to go right because you had already gone through a half an hour of back-and-forth yeah yeah um I think people need to understand what it's like to do one of these things too because you know you do it so often it becomes pretty and you're so good at talking you're such a good orator and you're so articulate that it comes off smooth and ease you're just having a conversation with someone but you're always considering the fact that people are listening to this you're always saying how do i how do I get more out of him or her how do I take this in and how do I get this person to expand upon this how do I you know how do I make this something make something out of this this is one of things that I felt Jack because he was talking in this way and we're we're really working hard on fixing all these issues and like oh Jesus I gotta change my gears here and try to figure out cuz like it's almost like we'd have to restart again every time a question would be answered he would stop talking and I go okay to next along you asked well it's almost like I have to restart the momentum of it but well again I'm totally I'm that kind of a speaker so you know I that wasn't a problem and I know what he talked like I'd never heard him talk ever so hearing him talk there and in talking to him live you know I mean some people are fucking effortless some people like Elon took a while like we had to start drinking no that was brutal yeah but so like but that I mean you know how much I tried to micromanage that behind the scenes I was trying to figure that out and you know you guys basically broke all the rules I let I have thought I laid down and heel on did it cuz heel on tweeted y'all be on Joe's podcast Thursday night at 9 o'clock ok but you know I met I didn't want you guys to go live right I wanted I wanted you to both have a chance to say wait a minute is smoking a blunt really the thing we want to be doing here so you know you didn't take my advice and it was what it was well we were drunk by the time the weed came out that was what's what's interesting to me is we were drinking from the beginning of the podcast we started drinking whiskey we both had two or three glasses of whiskey right before the weed came out nobody cared the fact that the CEO of Tesla was drunk right like no one cared about that I mean wasn't drunk but he shouldn't drive I don't know if that was obvious I don't know if they saw that you were drinking was obvious in the beginner pouring the whiskey right I mean it's on the table we had ice we're clinking glasses salute I mean it was very obvious yeah I mean the the problem for me there with that podcast frankly was that I feel like you both got unlucky with Walsh is where he was in his life at that moment and because so what that podcast showcased at least for the first I don't know 90 minutes was just how many user interface problems you could have with elan right like he just showed up as kind of fairly weird right he's not he's not always like that by any stretch I mean he can give a very loose interview and but you were working I mean you it was just absolutely heroic work trying to keep that conversation happening you know in the beginning but once we got loose yeah that was good but it was still it's like you know he was just in a space that he was so massively stressed and so overworked and just I mean he had you know fires everywhere that had to be put out and so I just thought you know as a friend I just felt like okay this is sort of the wrong time to be doing this and this is it you know and and so I just felt you know it just felt unlucky to me so because he's again I you know I see him in in many other moments and he can be okay that was out there was actually a circumstance where I was looking at the comments right you know and and I was saying okay these these are people who are basically reading him as somebody who is is much stranger than in fact he he ever is and I could see why they were doing that because he the guy he just seemed in a very stressed space in his life well it was interesting he was very different when he first got here versus when the mic came on right when he first got here he pulls out the fucking blowtorch and starts shooting this flamethrower in the middle of the hallway and we're laughing and I'm like he's gonna be easy this is great right and then we sat down and then stiff yeah right off the bat and I'm just trying to massage it and get them get them get them going although I honestly I think that is another consequence of live I'm not arguing that you shouldn't be live because it it has a massive advantage for you as well but it is there's just a different feeling yeah like you know if I knew that this was being taped and I could rethink the thing we're about to say about Liam Neeson or whatever it is yeah you know it's it's different yeah and so but well the Liam Neeson story is a perfect go there yeah let's go there a perfect example of a story where you know if you were Liam's friend you would go don't tell that one he's like but I want to be honest yeah like don't don't you could be honest with me I'm not gonna judge you if you tell me that someone got raped and you went out with a baseball bat for a week looking for a black man to beat up all the kill to kill I'd be like oh Jesus Christ man like what the fuck was going through your head at that point in time like that's terrible like yeah like I feel awful about it I can't believe that was me but right but it didn't happen nothing happened and now you know people are calling him a racist and they don't want him in movies and well I mean this is this is fascinating to me because again this is a much larger problem with with massive implications we need to think through the whole process of redemption for this in our society right like we we have to understand what are the what are the criteria for successful apologies and for forgiveness like what like what just what because special I mean we're in a world where people are having their their reputations destroyed and their careers threatened for tweets they sent as teenagers Yeah right and and you know more this is the Dorsey's point things are not disappearing online anymore in a certain point you know everyone this is gonna be a 360 cut a panopticon view of everyone's life you know there are people who have grown up on social media and everything is out there and I mean the irony here for me is that you have you know progress progressives and you know people on the far left who receive a disclosure like you know Liam Neeson's does take his and they just want you know they just want to see him burned alive right let's just do the Wicker Man on this guy because this is you know this is so awful and yet alongside that these same people on the left are people who have as a as a genuine ethical norm the rehabilitation of murderers well you could be somebody who spent you know 20 years in prison for a crime you admit you committed and there's this norm around Redemption and so there's you know there's no way to square those two things well they're constantly holding these two two contradictions right I mean here's another one women's rights and support of the hijab I mean yeah what yeah this is what's going on there how do you do that you know don't be Islamophobic but also support women's rights and gay rights yeah okay well I think Eric Weinstein our mutual friend calls these the hilbert problems for social justice warriors and they David Hilbert was a very famous mathematician who at the turn of the 19th century posed a set of problems in mathematics that you know we're just you know the on his list of the most desirable questions the hardest questions and the most consequential questions to answer and so you know Erica being a mathematician has flipped that around ironically and said these are these are the questions that social justice warriors have to answer and they're these impossible opposition's of this sort but so the liam neeson thing and you know forgive me if i if there's some detail that has come out that i'm not aware of but my understanding of it is he you know he had a friend who was raped and then he reported this state of mind this murderous state of mind he was in where he was walking around with the he calls it Akash i'ma that's the British word for like a it's like a small metal club right it's like a blackjack or like the another term for I think and looking for a black guy to kill you know like doesn't hoping someone's gonna come out of the woodwork and threaten him so that he could you know kill this guy in this act of instrumental violence because his friend had been raped by a black guy right just like any black guy will do now that's that's sort of like the the extra horrific wrinkle to the story right now and he's confessing this as a kind of a symptom of transient mental illness at least as far as I know it's like he's horrified by the fact that he was in this state of mind right can you imagine like I know Liam Neeson an actor I have everything to lose and although I don't remember what at what point in his life he said this happened can you imagine that I was in the state of mind right and this is as you say it an all too honest disclosure but it is damn interesting right and it is the kind of thing that we should be able to talk about right and it's not and the fact that this big is becoming synonymous with racism seems just wrong given given how he's did he described her at least how I've I've heard this because he's saying listen if this had been an Armenian guy or an Italian or a Japanese guy I'd be looking for one of them right I mean what what what this was at least on his telling is the the virus of instrumental violence I mean the virus of like this is how every blood feud ever in human history gets start is like you like someone from your tribe killed my brother and now what I want to do is kill anyone from your tribe right doesn't matter who you and and that's you know clearly as toxic as it gets you know ethically but that's not racism right that's just that is that we have a word for it it's in its instrumental violence but you know yeah obviously he's getting totally pilloried over this but we need we just need to figure out how to talk about how people can redeem themselves once something this unsavory is is revealed about their past whether they reveal it or whether it's just you know have found out about them yeah I mean it is racism though right because he's specifically looking for a black guy I mean that it's a part of the other tribe no but it doesn't suggest that he has us that he disposed and he feels one way or another about black people it's like if you told me yeah I mean he could he could have said again it could have been an Irish guy right or it could have been me well I guess he's Irish is he's a Scottish or Irish it could have been an English guy right it could have been it like any type right it's like is the the the salience of the tribe is what he was reacting to you know at least in his description I don't know why you wouldn't take him at his word given that he didn't have to say any of this in the first place right I mean like this is a an amazingly honest and unnecessary disclosure but it's um and I don't think people would think of it as racism if he if the story simply was you know she got raped by a cop and I was just hoping to go kill a cop right right you know it's the same story right and so yeah but we're so trigger-happy in our outrage with respect to anything like why do you think that is like what what is going on because outrage seems to be more in season than it's ever been in my lifetime I don't I don't remember outrage being so just such a it's it's it's recreational yeah there's there's a it's back to Jack I mean yeah a lot it has a lot to do with social media and Twitter in particular yeah I mean you have like so for instance I missed the whole Covington high school Catholic fiasco not on Twitter basically was ignoring Twitter I saw I saw it out of the corner of my eye like man this is interesting this is this is blowing up but I I was so off Twitter that I had there was no temptation for a hot take for me right and I saw these people just torching their reputations by taking these like like Kathy Griffin basically calling for the daxing of these kids you know given all that she has suffered you know from from mob behavior online and she's you know whipping up her own mob it was just nuts but it's normal that some people do it's what the platform is calling out of people but it's also when people have been shamed and they've done something awful then they reinforce their base like that now she's like is so heavily hard left because the right-wing ran after her like anyone on the right that does anything she's calling for her side to go after this person like reinforcing that she's a part of that tribe that she's a part of that left-wing tribe yeah yeah well it's so obviously everyone has a lot to lose doing this especially in a case where all the facts aren't in and if you just wait at a beat I'm even though New York Times got this wrong the New York Times writes an article about the kids in the manga hat that that they have to rescind and the so then as the dust is settling and I see these people some people are doubling down some people are issuing public apologies I see somebody who's actually kind of you know branded herself as you know one of my enemies for a reason I can't fathom but this journalist Kara Swisher who you know she works for recode and and and Vox now but she's got a big podcast and she's a bit she actually writes for The New York Times now she's got an opinion piece you know a regular column for the New York Times she's a tech journalist and I you know happened to know she doesn't like me because she's tweeted against you know she's some disparaging things about me on Twitter and we had a you know an offline conversation about it but I saw her she said one of the most vituperative and you know fairly crazy things in response to the kids initially and then once more information came out she walked it back and she basically apologized you know good for her Twitter and so I said good for you Kara I just wanted to support this norm of acknowledging that you got something wrong and I wanted to do it even I wanted to actually do it for someone who I know really doesn't like me like I mean that was an added bonus for me because that that's and that's another norm that that I think we should support it's like like we should we should play fair even with our enemies yes and yeah I mean honestly I you know I try to play fair even with people who never play fair with me even someone like Glenn Greenwald or raise Aslan I mean people who have just you know lied about me endlessly if I get something wrong about them I publicly apologize for it so I did this and so this was at the the absolute 11th hour with respect to this this you know scandal online and when I saw the kind of pain I was getting just for a consortium Kara in her walk back of this thing way at a moment when it was obvious she should have walked this back I got people saying you know unsubscribing from your podcast you are you know now I know you're a fucking racist you know it was just just pure pain and I just thought wow man that's you know it's like you just touch this thing at its very end and you're you know it's that the slime gets on you so yeah it is it's the medium you know it is we has no opportunity to do this before it is the medium and it's also people that don't feel like their opinions are being heard like they want their opinion to be heard they want it to be heard right now and it might not be a very well thought-out opinion but they know that they have the ability to blare it out and say yeah they just send it out and that that did the ability to do that is just intoxicating for folks reach you you talked about this with Jack there is a there what makes Twitter especially good for this is that everything has the same stature yeah your tweets no bigger than the other tweet that just called you an asshole yeah that's my kurt metzger take on it because Kurt massacre was a hilarious stand-up comedian he he'll write a Facebook blog only he only writes on Facebook I was like I like how it's set up he's like it's there's a big it differentiates between me and these fucking idiots who are commenting under there although ironically I hate Facebook I can't even I mean is just the graphic design on Facebook I find so offensive that I just can't look at Facebook so I use it as a publishing channel but I'm you know I keep threatening in my own mind to just delete the account because I just don't I mean I've only read the comments three times maybe ever yeah I know a time I read him it's like Jesus Christ it's like YouTube but alive I know it's like YouTube but with people with their real names it's you know this is a new world that we're living in man and everybody's trying to navigate this thing and figure it out as it goes along and not everybody's doing it well and I think this world is going to get more and more intrusive I think this is just the beginning I think we didn't see Twitter coming and whatever comes after Twitter and this is one of the things that I before the podcast I wanted to really talk to Jack about to get his take on what he thinks is next down the line because there's gonna be something that's more invasive there's gonna be something that is more whether it's I think probably something in the line of augmented reality there were probably a decade away from something that makes this look like books look like you know a fucking corkboard at a bookstore ya know although strangely we're live we're living to the golden age of audio here it's like we went to full into video and we're poised to go like you know 3d and and you know VR and then all of a sudden Audio is king well how about phone calls and texts like I mean I called you out of the blue once and it was like supermarket somebody said on Twitter once it was hilarious that facetiming facetiming me out of nowhere is just like knocking on my door you're right without calling me straight up right she was angry that so many facetimed her no it always feels like an old school move to unless like my book agent calls me you know out of the blue and it's just it seems yeah it is just like a knock on the door my friend Joey Diaz only calls ya only cut for years he would scream at you if you text and then recently within the last 2 or 3 years he started texting occasionally he only calls well I got so I got to tell you so having released this meditation app has given me a kind of a sanity check on everything else I'm doing which is it's very interesting because in releasing the app you know it's like it's firewalled from all the other controversial stuff I'm doing I'm like I'm not you know in the app I'm not whinging about Trump or you know talking about any of the stuff I talk about on my podcast it's just me trying to teach meditation as a largely as an antidote to all of the stuff we're talking about it's like every what got this as Tristan Harris says we've got this slot machine in our pocket that it's continually gaming our attention all day long and you know in my view a meditation app is like the one thing you can have on your smartphone that completely subverts the technology and you can get you to actually live a more examined life using the technology right but what's been amazing for me personally is that I put it out and it is the only thing that I have put out maybe ever right where it is it's been received exactly as I've intended right there's no controversy it's just like like the people who are finding it useful love it and they say thank you and it's like they're getting exactly what I thought I was putting into it and it's like it made me think what the hell am i doing over here with all of this hot sex stuff that has been and endlessly maliciously spun against me and misunderstood and you know it's just a mess I have to I have to do both because there's a lot of important things to talk about that are gonna be analyst lis spun and and maliciously and misunderstood but it is it's been so refreshing to have one thing I mean me you must get this with with you know doing your stand-up or something or maybe - I don't have a thing I get shit for everything or maybe maybe UFC commentary no come afternoon have for everything well it's just it has been a psychologically it's been a revelation to have one thing that I can put out that is just it's just received appreciated and they got what I intended and it's just you know thank you it's just like oh fuck that's possible I have no I had if I ever knew I have forgotten that that that was possible well meditation now it kind of makes sense because the people are gonna flock to that are looking to meditate they're looking to have their mind they're not looking a spew hatred on Facebook no yeah yeah yeah I thought that after the podcast with Jack I was like Jesus Christ let's just stick to podcasts or comics because podcast with comics if you know you put your foot in your mouth everybody knows you're just trying to be funny right you know if you do a podcast and and the thing about the podcast with Jack it's nothing like I said anything bad it's what I didn't say yeah that was upsetting to so many people but that's such a loaded thing and because of that podcast now there's there's negative to it that blow back there's a lot of you know toxic anger and all that but the positive is what I like the positive that came out of it is me forced to re-examine how I do podcasts re-examine the significance of each individual guest and especially someone that comes with as much baggage you know with that without lack of a better term as Jack that you're you know you got to think that there's people listening and there's some questions that you really have to work at you have to you have to push through and even if he's he's dancing and pure wedding I should have went back to okay wise Kathy Griffin on your platform yeah like if doc sings bad you want you don't want Docs you don't want threats of violence when someone says I want names okay what are you gonna do with these fucking names right what are gonna do with them what do you do with the sixteen-year-old kid in his name's and then when you see the actual the actual video of what actually happened and there's so many people that are still not walking it back still no I'm doubling down a lot of people double down fuck him and here's another little piece of insight my friend Matt lived in DC and those hats those maggots they're fucking everywhere there's these little where these kids were that area there's these carts that sell these hats so these kids bought those hats that day it's not like they're these Mag of kids they'd probably just be in assholes right there teenage boys their frontal lobe is not fully formed and they're all together feeding off each other like a pack of gremlins yeah I was a teenage boy you were a teenage boy you know how fucking stupid used to be yeah I mean I was probably way more stupid than you but I was a mess I had my moments yeah no I'd be just you get a hundred teenage boys together in a crowd you know on a school trip and you get some native elder drumming in one of their some guy's face yeah you know it was amazing what didn't happen right there exactly no violence nobody you know the way he handled it all he did a smile yeah so I mean listen I'm as biased as anyone against a Catholic school kid wearing a manga hat yeah it's like you know like given given my backstory it's like yeah I'm totally poised to think this guy's an asshole and it's likely always to be an asshole but what people read into an uncomfortable smile right I mean just like the the the shots of his face with the tweets that said you know this is what white privilege looks like this is you know this is this is the everything that's wrong in our society it's just we have to slow down how about razor wrote have you ever seen a more honorable yeah come on man you want to punch him yeah cuz he's smiling Cartman Rosa calls for violence from the left are so fucking disturbing to me because my parents were hippies when I grew up I always thought of the left and we all we you know I've been called right when I've never voted anything but democratic in my life except for Gary Johnson Gary Johnson was only time I voted independent or whatever the fuck he was libertarian right that was just cuz he did my podcast vol foot Tulsi Gabbard because she did my podcast but the the the the left was always very considerate well-read they were there were the people that were more open-minded they were supporting of gay people and minorities that was the left and they were nonviolent they were the people that are protesting Vietnam when I was a kid well Sarge is supportive of the virtue of speech of free speech and self-criticism yes right like I mean that's the the the disadvantage of the left against the right has always been there's this self scrutiny and willingness to wonder whether or not I'm wrong that isn't mirrored if you go far enough right and it has there has been so there's been kind of an asymmetric war between left and right you know politically from for much of our lifetime but you go far enough left now and you're you're meeting a kind of totalitarian resistance to speech yeah and it's yeah it's very I mean I'm just it'll be interesting to see how that the 2020 campaign plays out well I'm certainly worried that we could totally blow it with some leftist social you yeah uprising well yeah that would be unfortunate because I think they would just double down the other side we would be better off with some sort of a reasonable centrist right someone has made sense and you know one of the things that I liked about Tulsi is that she's a veteran and you know I mean like she's she seems very reasonable to me but except but I haven't followed her career closely but it just seems like she's not making the right noises on things like Syria and Assad yeah I don't know enough about that comment yeah I don't know enough about Assad and the controversy or whether or not he gassed is well that yeah that is I think I'm controversial in terms of what she I mean that is I'm controversial which in terms of what she is saying about it about him I mean she's capable of putting both feet in her her mouth on that I thought she's what she's saying he's not an enemy of America right so yeah I mean again I'm not close enough to it and but I would you know be very circumspect about endorsing her going forward and into it do a little homework because I think her candidacy is not going to age well that's what I like who makes sense to you Elizabeth Warren's fuck now is the most recent one yeah she's got the most recent one before she filled out an application she wrote Native American on it just having done the DNA test yeah playing that game with Trump that was such a miscalculation well the fact that she released the data and the data is so clear well it's almost like she had to because otherwise he would call her Pocahontas to the end of time but that but then to then have to apologize to Native Americans for having done the tab it's just well because the the Mount of Native American is so low I've been joking around about it that I am like a hundred times more African Ron she is Native America yeah I'm 1.6 percent African and she's less than like wait less than 1% Native American right but this these are this is the sort of masochistic death spiral that people on the Left can get into it's like you're like the left and I've always said that the left eats its own in a way that the right never does it's just it's um we have to find someone who can stand outside that the circular firing squad right and it would be someone who's you know it would be in my view it would be somebody like a a younger bloomberg right I'm I don't think I don't think it's Bloomberg but like somebody it's like a legit businessman who could call bullshit on all of trumps fake business acumen and who's not ethically compromised right but who can who can get stuff done and so right and and it's definitely not someone who feels the need to pander to the far left on these identity politics issues I think identity politics is really gonna be bad for us against Trump because so much of the country the crucial sliver of the country me just have to ask yourself who was it who voted for Obama and then two or twice and then voted for Trump right those people aren't racist right those people are sick of being called racist right yeah and and the so what's happening on the Left around identity politics and all of these I mean it's not that racism isn't a problem it's not that transgender issues don't have to be worked out I mean like all like all of those are legit concerns but the fact that that's the center-of-mass politically on the left in in a in a nationwide election against someone like Trump I just think that's a absolute recipe for disaster because the people that subscribe to that ideology don't realize how many people think it's silly yeah you know when you're in the oppression Olympics and you're trying to win the gold and for and for how many people it's actually miss applied right it's like there there are many more explanations for voting for Trump in addition to racism business yeah like yes every racist voted for Trump you know virtually so that's fine every white supremacist voted for Trump but that's not the story about why Trump got elected and it's a long story it's just much more I mean they're people who just have not what do users are not thriving in the current economy you know it's like we got automation displacing manufacturing jobs you got the consequences of Trade and immigration and you have legitimate concerns about your village there are legitimate concerns about immigration that have nothing to do with racism and so if you're gonna score any hesitation over something like open borders as a sign of your xenophobia and racism you're gonna lose virtually everyone who has a same concern about how to how you you know keep people in how you how you admit the right people into a country right I mean there's their economic concerns and there are social concerns and yeah I mean and you don't have to be ben shapiro to share some of those concerns right and I must say invention pairs racist obvious I'm saying he's a conservative and you know takes a more conservative line on on many of these questions than I do but you know it's like you either you either think but just take immigration as the narrow case you either think you should be able to know who's coming into the country or you don't right now if you if you think you should just have open borders there are two problems with that one is there are many good arguments against that and two I don't know what the percentage is but it's got to be something like 95 percent of Americans would be terrified at that prospect right so if you're if any of your platform is essentially saying a concern about immigration is synonymous with racism you know you have a platform that it's gonna alienate most people and that's the the Democrats are totally capable of seeming like that whether in fact that's that's true for most Democrats what do you think is what's the primary factor like what what caused identity politics to reach this boiling point that it's at right now well it is I think in large measure what the internet is doing to us it's not that identity politics hasn't been a feature of politics for forever but there is a there's the silo in effect there's the the effect that groups become more radicalized the as groups because the most extreme voices tend to pipe up more and then and and everyone everyone who's who's silent I mean it's kind of a diffusion of responsibility around around countering these extreme voices I get you know every you can it only takes a small percentage of extreme voices to cow the rest of a group and and make the group seem like the extreme voices are speaking for the group right you know and I so I think what we have on both the left and the right we have a small percentage I mean you know the last poll I saw that trying to gather this question was something like you know six or eight percent on the tails that are making it seem like these are and I think it's I think it's more of a problem on the left and on the right because I mean the extreme right stick is fringe and looks fringe right like the guy with the guys in Charlottesville in the Charlottesville with our tiki torches they don't look like they represent the Republican Party or that or the the the right the Conservatives in any general sense they're a symptom of some problem but it's a smaller problem it's a minority problem whereas on the Left the extreme voices are have massive sway in you know major companies in tech companies in journalism in academia like like the silencing effect and the reputational cost that's being paid by even very powerful people in all these mainstream forums on the left is is just that's not mirrored on the right you know and it's I mean so I I don't know if I told you this certainly didn't say it on a previous podcast with you but so I was at dinner with a bunch of Silicon Valley we were talking about III I was it was at the moment when that that Netflix story happened where the what Jonathan friedlin got fired over using the n-word in a closed-door meeting and and you know it was it was a using the n-word in response to my friend Tom Segura who you know yeah right exactly okay special yeah he said you can't say retarded anymore and then explained like that you know there's words you can't use anymore right didn't even wasn't using it in a joke like calling someone retarded or saying something's retarded but they were and he was saying that that's like using the N light around by yeah yeah but he used the n-word in this meeting right it's like using the n-word and that just the the mirror intonation of those syllables yes was so shocking right that he wound up getting fired right and and again he was he was using it in the context of expressing just how careful Netflix has to be about speech I mean he was going social justice warrior on himself among social justice warriors and he said this is how worried we have to be and then he gave the magic incantation you can still say retarded which is amazing because it's deafening in his defense you kind of have to say both words you're not saying the R word right like using the R word is like using the N word around black people we're getting to some weird fucking yeah weird place with this actually no now I realize why I'm confused about why I think I've talked about this because I did a podcast with Chelsea Handler which hasn't aired I mean did a months ago because she was doing a documentary on white privilege I think and III think I'm actually cast as the guy with white privilege and this honor boy yeah that's gonna be fun you have white privilege yeah so um but I recorded a podcast with her so anyway so we hit this this point because this had just come out then and I think her documentary is probably for Netflix so what was her take on it well she was she was basically I mean she was playing the other side of the net for this you know and you know not I mean we'll have to see I mean I think I at least in my own mind I certainly made sense there and and she shouldn't have a lot of response to what I was saying I haven't heard the audio or seeing the video but the so anyway I was at a dinner with a bunch of tech CEOs talking about this problem and one guy who who I won't name who runs a big company that I which I won't name said listen you have no idea how deep this goes like I have an HR complaint where there's a guy who identifies as a furry right he thinks he's a cat and because we don't provide litter boxes in the bathroom right he's he's launched an HR complaint right this is real this is this was told as a real story in in as a counterpoint or in in amplification of the story we were talking about in efflux right so it's like this is and yet this has happening like this is people are having to navigate the CEOs of multi-billion dollar companies or having to navigate around this stuff in-house right and I mean the Google thing over James to more right I mean that was that was an enormous problem in Google right like that was the wheels were coming off as far as I can tell you know from what I've heard what in how so just that like there was a there was gonna be a Google mutiny over James tomb or if he were away he has to be fired yeah yeah this was this was a big deal at Google that's own and what he and what he wrote was essentially like a you know a B+ term paper and human biology right and it was like inmate you can you can with expenses you can push back on some of the science say or but like this was not a malicious distortion of the the state of the science right and and this was not calling for discrimination against women this was just saying listen men and women are different and they've got different interests right and this could account for why there's an unequal representation at the level of sino software software development and so what like we're on the Left we're finding it very difficult to even talk about differences between men and women right that there's you know you need start with you know start with a you you know count from there right that is already a taboo conversation to have and then you know as we said at the beginning in talking about Twitter that one writer again I think her name is Megan Murphy she got booted for saying men are not women yeah I mean that's so so again so politically I'm very worried that unless we resolve that or just cut through it we don't stand a chance against Trump in 2020 I was reading a story about a woman who's on some sort of an LBGT panel and she's a part of some group and she was kicked out of it by a man who identifies as a lesbian and he has penis right right yeah with Monica Lee so and this is a point that think he has a penis he'll want to be sure it definitely identifies as a lesbian I might have read a Twitter comment about how preposterous that was and said the penis part well this is something Andrew Sullivan wrote in a recent article on this is that the the transgender thing is at odds with gay rights yes in a fundamental sense I mean you can't balance these equations because it's like - gay identity absolutely focuses on the legitimate differences between men and women it's like I'm a man I like men I don't like women that's my situation but once you once you change the your your notion of what you know how gender relates to sex it begins to erode this this claim on the legitimacy of a gay identity right the thing is that they're all marginalized so they stick together that's the idea I guess behind it it sort of but there's I only imagine what you know Andrew Sullivan's Twitter feed looks like now because he only he writes these articles I'm sure he's just gets eviscerated by the left you know and he's just you know straight up talking about you know this is what gay rights looks like and this is this is how you can't be a man with a penis whose identifies as a lesbian right yeah but you can't say that right and you also can't say that a man with the penis is not a woman because if a man like a penis I can say it because I can't be fired but but if you do say it you will get a certain amount of hate I mean there's people that are saying that men who will not date trans women who still have penises right they're transphobic and this is I mean there's you have you ever have you ever met Jamie kill Steen so Jamie and I have a checkered history an awfully maybe you and I have spoken about this I've never met Jamie but Jamie when Jamie was social justice warrior number one he went hard he went hard on me yeah yeah like he he just he just was dunking on me endlessly in ways that were totally unfair I mean he was just you know he was he was working very hard to become an enemy and then he had his his epiphany then the social justice mob came for him over something over almost nothing right over him trying to get laid I mean like they were saying he was a creep or something like that try hitting on girls yeah well I missed the details there but then he can't then so then he since sent me very friendly and apologetic emails about just you know I'm sorry what I did and and you know he want he wants to do a podcast I haven't taken him up on it but you know that that maybe that could be an interesting conversation searly apologetic yeah he's a good guy I mean he and I had our own issue at one point in time over a podcast that we did versus it was you remember when the Daniel Tosh rape controversy like do you remember this I know who Tom no joke I should say rape joke some woman in a crowd he was he was on stage and he wasn't supposed to be there it was at the Laugh Factory and DA Mara put him on stage and he goes look I don't have any material what do you guys want to talk about and some guy yells out rape and that's always helpful and so you know it's like some drunk in a crowd right he goes Jesus Christ and so Daniel Tosh's take on he's out okay what what's funny about that humiliation violence you know he's like berating this guy in trying to do stand-up while he's doing this and some woman yells out actually there's nothing funny about rape and he goes wouldn't be funny if someone just raped her right and everybody starts laughing I do remember and so this woman wrote a giant blog about it and she wanted him to apologize about it and Jamie went after Daniel Tosh as a kind of fellow yes as a fellow comics saying that it's you know like and I was like well she's a heckler the woman heckled like while he's trying to do do stand-up and he's like I'm not gonna support rape culture and he's like how the fuck is that rape culture like he's he's clearly making a joke about something she said that was very very patronizing like obviously he doesn't think there's something funny about rape this is he's just trying to work through this adlib set that he's doing with some guy who yelled out something that this whole crowd has to respond to he can't just ignore the fact that it happened and go how about fire trucks folks why they always read no he can't do that he's got he's got to deal with what this guy said and so that's what he tosses out there and everybody laughed by the way also it's in the part of his persona persona just a villain he takes it to the edge yeah he's edgy comedian he's funny and you know and Jamie and I had this little tit-for-tat about it but he's very honest about his mistakes like when you talk to him and he's he's got great insight because he was that guy you know he was that guy that was going back and forth with people online all day and checking his mentions I couldn't walk down the street more than five steps before he pull out his phone and check his mentions you know how people responding to his late as Duncan or takedown or you know it's just it's a toxic thing that people are doing it's that's this you know looking for people that are that are bad I'm looking for things that are wrong looking for wrong speak it's very toxic it's toxic for the people that are doing it it's toxic for the people that are receiving it it's just it's not a way that human beings would ever communicate in one-on-one I mean I tried to communicate with people the same way online as I would if they're right in front of me and don't understand but I try that's my my goal is to try to talk to someone as if they were right in front of me that's clearly not how everybody's hand no no I think road rage is the is the best in us what's happening yeah I've adopted that I've adopted that way of looking at it too and but the only difference is a road rage you know there's a like a physiological reason for road rage because you're you're you're in a dangerous situation you're subliminally taking stuff going fast right you're gonna a metal machine with a bunch of assholes that are probably looking at their phone and everybody's going fast and you could die at any moment if someone goes wrong if you're on a highway like the 405 and you have five lanes going 70 miles an hour it is a fucking miracle that no one dies yeah and every day we do it every day everything's fine yeah well so oh let's go back to this idea of what the the actual normative response would be when somebody puts their foot in their mouth or something from their past gets disclosed I mean the the the stupid and indefensible thing they did is a teenager right yeah you know and you know like this you know you got these guys who are now having their careers destroyed for having dressed up you know in blackface or Enoch in a hood for Halloween or whatever it was I mean I you know I don't I think I think this that one politician said he's not even in the in the photo but the photo was on his yearbook page or like whatever you put on your yearbook page in high school right you find out this thing that you know adult is going to defend right but what is the path back what like what is the reboot that what should be acceptable because we don't even know it seems we don't even know what could conceivably work to rehabilitate somebody's career and yet on this other side we've got people who again are being let out of prison for murders they admit they committed right or rapes they admit admit they committed and they're rehabilitated and we and these are these are stories we're supposed to feel good about right so that we have to figure out how to square this on the left and you know I don't know I made the the way I've been thinking about it is that it has to be intelligible how you are different from the person who committed that thing right so like if you if you did something that was let's say legit racist when you were 20 and was like mark mark walberg is an example right I mean he was running around just beating people senseless right and for avowed racist motives I believe when he was a teenager well a guy lost his eye right yeah basically yeah so but and I think that was a I think I was a Vietnamese guy he attacked or but I mean he was just doing truly indefensible things now I don't know what sort of you know PR moment he has had since or how he's apologized for it or but I mean that was a that's a very different time I think if it was if all that stuff was being discovered about him now there may be no way back to well maybe the problem is with this day and age it could be reignited right like even though he's apologized for it and even though that it's been addressed it absolutely yet reignite him it's just me talking about on your podcast it's fucking him over right good yeah I mean and also people have to recognize that there's some things but you can't retroactively ly instill today's ideas of what constitutes racism on 1985 so if you were in high school in 1985 and you dressed up as mr. t right that you know I don't know if that was racist back then I never did it but I don't know if that's racist like if you had a bunch of gold chains and you made your hair black and or you made your face black and gave yourself a mohawk he said I'm mr. t for Halloween right and the pictures emerge today what you did when you went door-to-door when you were 15 or 12 or whatever you were knocking on people's doors and everybody's laughing oh you're mr. t nobody thought it was racist yeah but let's take let's take the hard case let's say you were racist right I mean so I've had this guy is Christian patchouli knee on my podcast once who's a you know X neo-nazi just legit racist right he's got all the tattoos to prove it and now there are major problems with Christian pitch Alenia as I think you know that I has discovered after that podcast but so this is not an endorsement of him sorry Christian but the the there's a path back I mean so like he's celebrated on the left yeah he's a former neo-nazi and he's you know I discovered him on Sarah Silverman's show on wherever that is Hulu and you know he's darling of the left right and darling of MSNBC for this redemption story so but what is the you take someone like any of these politicians who have something in their backstory that is ugly my feeling is all there has to be is a transparent and intelligible account of how you are now different of how you can actually honestly look back on this thing and say yeah I am as embarrassed by that as you think I should be right yeah that's not like that is nothing that that does not represent how I view the world at all now but there's just there's a the spirit of the time on social media again especially on the left and to our you know total dysfunction politically is to never accept any of that I mean there's there is no apology good enough right and or the or there's you know the most cynical possible interpretation of your of your apology it's like you're just trying to you're the only reason why you're apologizing it's because you want to save your job yes and that you know we have to figure out how to I mean we just need some you know recovery discs that we can reboot from here because it's just not this is going someplace terrible and again to look at it through the lens narrowly politically of you know over the next two years it's it's to the massive disadvantage of the left it certainly is but I don't see any way to fix that like with the current climate and its current attitude where people are engaging in this recreational outrage it fits the climate I don't mean I don't know what would have to happen for people to come to some sort of a realization I mean it would have to happen to them like it did to James like what happened with Jamie Kelsey is it they turned on him and he's like oh my god this is awful yeah like I'm what's that's not and then he realized you know I mean I don't know what other thing could happen well I mean what weird the game we're playing is part of it I mean you and I are in a position to take risks that you know even the people at the top of journalism you can't I mean like like megan kelly says one wrong thing and you know it doesn't matter that she's got a twenty million dollar con contract he's just she's fired and when you look at the thing that she said I mean it was just a question yeah she just didn't seem to understand how charged the phrase blackface was right she's just ignorant of that piece of history or something but like you know so she just she did she put her foot in her mouth she gave an apology that was just like you know full-blown hostage video apology it's like you know just like I am so fucking sorry you don't even know like here take a sample of my blood and you'll just see Mike you know yes my cortisol and not good enough not good enough and they letter say the apology totally is even more crazy they let her come back say the apology and then go good thanks for doing that so but so she no one's job in that space is secure enough where they can take real risks but you know you and I you know you and I could do an interview with Louie CK right like and just process his coming back into stand up yes and do it in a way where if people didn't like it you just say okay fuck off right this is the conversation we had and I think modeling that more and more I mean I think I think we have to take those risks and people like us have to take those risks and hope to break this spell by having those conversations in public I would hope that we're having some kind of an impact on it but I feel like we're you know we're throwing buckets of cold water into a volcano I just I just don't you know I don't know if it's enough I just but we have pretty big buckets I mean you have an enormous bucket I mean you're you're reaching more people than the biggest television shows are reaching people aren't aware of this but it's just a fact so it's it's so I think that's part of it and then changing the norm somehow of how we engage on social media I think is there's another piece yeah I agree I agree with you the norm on how we engage in social media I think is flavored by two things one the immediacy of it the fact that there's no person in front of you you don't experience their their anger or their fear or their sadness when you say something fucked up but also anonymity and I think anonymity is good in a lot of ways like for whistleblowers people that work in a certain environment where they want to be honest but they would get fired you know with a very restricted environment but they have maybe a controversial opinion they want to hex they want to be able to express free speech and they can't they can't unless they do something anonymous and even sometimes people when they do things anonymous they get caught and they get in trouble like I remember there was a guy on 4chan who was you know who would say bunch of fucked up things like a lot of people do and people tracked him down and found out who he was and then sent all of these anonymously authored posts to his employer and he got fired and this guy was a father and he had children and he was you know supporting his family and now he's struggling to make a living he's got to try to figure because he wrote some things anonymously online on a message board and he found recreation saying fucked up things you know I don't you know I don't know what the solution is but I feel like anonymity it encourages less hospitable behavior did you hear about the professor at a academic conference get into an elevator and making a just a dad joke of as he gets it gets into a crowded elevator in an academic conference and you know someone asked what floor and he says women's lingerie please it's like it's like a Dean Martin joke or whatever right someone in the elevator was so offended by that that they lodged a complaint and I've it's been now you know at least a month or so since I heard the story so I don't know if he was fired but I like he was fighting for his academic life Oh over this complaint process Dean Martin okay I mean just like that that in the fullness of time that is going to seem like some insane witch panic right like there's no such thing as witches and yet people are getting burned alive because of allegations witchcraft we're in that kind of situation and we we just have to wake up yeah and and so I well you and I don't teach and we're not in in a university and we're not in that bubble I think the people that are in that bubble then they escape that bubble then go to whatever tech company or whatever business they continue that same bubble like behavior and they want everybody to act we ask they want everybody around them to behave the way that they've been programmed to think that everybody is supposed to behave and you see that now from a lot of young people you see a lot of young people who are entering into the workforce think that the standards and the norms that they got enforced upon them at Yale or Columbia wherever they went to school like that this is how you're supposed to behave social justice is important and this is real and you have to recognize your privilege you have to check your priveledge and you have to do this and you have to do that you have to support trans rights you have to call out culture call out culture is a big one that's a big part of it cancel culture you know everybody wants everybody to lose their job you want mean this is the way that things change the way things change is you have to reinforce the fact that there's these new standards and it has to be severe repercussions for deviating yeah so very very much about controlling Jordan goes on about this Jordan Peterson it's like one of his pet subjects yeah that this is where this goes this is all about control and that it's a very slippery slope and when you start telling people what to do and what not to do and that there's like these these indefensible undebatable standards that have to be reinforced and you can't talk about it like and that's what happens me and Kelly she's our well how come I know I get the fuck out of here sixty million dollar job again the crucial moment for me is why is it that the apology isn't good enough then this isn't this but what is by all appearances a sincere apology yes like like where the link there is no link to real racism like there's no link to like oh yeah I want to live in a society where black people have it harder than white people right like okay if that's if that's who you are if you're a legit racist well then fine we know we can understand why we want to boycott your business or we want to you know you you know you we want nothing to do with you right there should be massive social pressure against those kinds of noxious political commitments but if someone misspeaks or it's an off-color joke and they weren't it's like they weren't trying to offend anyone and they're just you know they wish they could take it back and like and and and that links up with I mean did you see you must have seen the nor McDonald yes I mean that was brutal yeah right like it's what he was you know he knew he couldn't use the word retard right because it's like that that's gonna get him in trouble and so I mean it's hilarious and explain what happened okay so he was he was on Howard Stern chair wasn't he I think I think I saw you say he was a I could have this wrong but the gist of this is is right I believe he's on the Howard Stern Show and he was about to use the word retard so so okay a little walk this back now it's coming back to me he was defend he was talking about his friend the ordeal that louis c.k has gone through in this just massive exile experience right so there's massive social shunning and he said he was describing it in a way where it he then got accused that he was cared more about what louis c.k was going through than the women who felt victimized by louis c.k and that was not his intention at all apparently and so when he went to a to clarify this he was about to say but you'd have to be retarded to think that i cared more about louis ck's ordeal than the ordeal of these women who had you know felt their careers got derailed right but as the word retard was comin retarded was coming out of his mouth he tried to course-correct and because he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about he says you'd have to have down syndrom right right which is worse right it's more specific and it's like and then you got all these parents with Down syndrome who have kids Down syndrome who are just oh my god and so now he's just but he's then he was he was showed up on the view right would this this on this apology tour and I mean that's just amazing video to see him on the view surrounded by these these four women who know he's not a bad guy right like they're trying they're trying to throwing him lifeline after lifeline and he's so beaten down right yeah and he's so walking on eggshells and you got Whoopi Goldberg you know trying to just just pull him back you know from the Lions and it should be I mean it should be so straightforward like it does is it part of norms goal to cause pain for parents who have kids with mental disabilities right no I mean like it like like you you could you can look in you can look into this guy's eyes for it for ten seconds and know that this is not the bigot you're worried about right right for of course you know and and yet people just want him destroyed I don't know if they still do but it's like that the moment would like it was you know I think it was a real concern that his his show would get cancelled I mean like this was a well it hasn't been purchased for a second season and that's maybe that's part of the problem he was it is part of the problem he was devastated I mean I'm very good friends with Adam Egan he's a guy who runs the Comedy Store is the talent director at The Comedy Store and he's been on Norm's show he was on norms he was like norms sidekick on a show he's a very good friend would not write and norm really suffered from this in a way that he never suffered from anything in his career in terms of like his own personal feeling like he was devastated by it by the blowback and the reaction and he wanted to come on my podcast and talk about it but Netflix is like Netflix had no press don't have anything no press okay but so the fact that you can't talk your way out of yes that's the fucking disease well the problem is not that you can't talk your way out of it the problems that they wouldn't even let him attempt to talk your way out of it because they I think they realized that norms of maniac and norm is a maniac in the best sense of the word he's one of my favorite comics and he's hilarious fucking hilarious but he's also completely crazy in the best way possible Norman I randomly into some strange way randomly were seated next to each other on two separate flights oh yeah just randomly it's crazy like norm again like this is crazy and we had a great time just talking the entire flight and we were talking about cigarette smoke yeah yeah yeah I used to smoke I'm so glad I quit fucking terrible for you you know yeah I mean it's just but I you know I just always wanted a cigarette and then I'd be gambling I want a cigarette but I quit fuck fuck cigarette so how long did you quit Neely I've been had a cigarette in years oh my god that's great we land at LAX he goes right into a storm buy cigarettes I go what are you doing goes all that talk of cigarettes I just want one now he was lighting it on the way out the door he couldn't get out the door he lit it before he did you know the automatic door he was before it was opening he was lighting that cigarette I was like you're crazy but that's many many comedians are incredibly impossible this is norm I mean he's just well he's got such a he's so off kilter he's got a sort of Garry Shandling and crate like you don't know what's going to come out his mouth and brainiest less but okay we we have to be with let's put this back into the diversity Olympics we need some respect for neuro diversity yes right there are people who are somewhere on the spectrum toward autism right there's people who are that there's there spectrums we don't even know about we aren't we haven't named sure and everyone is in some weird spot and people misspeak right you there has to be a way back to say that's not what I meant right like like this is like offending people of this type was not my intention at some level that has to be good enough unless you know we open your closet and we see that you've got swastikas on you know everywhere you know and so I think we we have to we have to hold the line here you know yeah and very few people are in a position to be able to do it I mean you know like you know Netflix and net flix doesn't feel that can do it well Netflix is just so terrified of continual blowback and they thought like if we're gonna save this show the way to save it is to get him to stop talking right he's just gonna just take his other foot and take other people's feet and stuff them in its mouth as well I think one thing that might help to illuminate our understanding of how people behave is what you really enjoy talking about and you really definitely changed my way of looking at things that they're really essentially the concept of free will is a very flawed thing and that you have to really take into consideration who a person is right now and what what has caused them to be this person right now and that a lot of us are operating on this really bizarre momentum of our pasts and our behavior and our genetics and life experiences and all these different variables that really need to be taken into account this idea that you are autonomous and you are the director of your own life is true to a certain extent but it's also very complicated much more complicated than we would like to admit and when you're talking about something that happened when you were 17 like Brett Kavanaugh or something like that like yeah but Jesus Christ you know you're gonna hold a 55 man 55 year old man accountable to something that he did when he was 17 it wasn't a crime that girl and you're not exactly sure what happened that's this is all very strange this is very strange stuff well so taking the red pill on on freewill makes you much more forgiving of a lot of this stuff yeah cuz you see just everyone is an open system no one authored themselves no one created themselves no one no one can directly regulate the effect that of every influence that they had or didn't have you know it's like you are the totality of what brought to you here I mean the universe is sort of just pushed you to this point in time and the only thing you've got is your brain and it states and that is that is based on your genes and the totality of environmental influences you you as a system have have had working on you up until this moment and so the next words that come out of your mouth are part of that process now the people some people find this to be a you know frankly demoralizing picture I think well okay well I'm you're telling me telling me I'm just a robot but you're a robot that is open continuously open to influence to influence of you internally based on its own processes I mean there's like there's top-down control of you know the executive function in the brain to your you know your emotional life say and you're continually open to the influences of culture right you know the culture is this operating system that you're interacting with in each moment and whatever's getting in can change you in radical ways very quickly there's no telling how much you can change on the basis of one new idea coming your way right now I would argue that that process of change I mean if I say something that changes your view on anything that's not evidence of free will that is evidence of just yet more causality I mean you don't you don't pick the changes that come your way if I if I get you to see something that you didn't see a moment before you're not responsible for the fact that you didn't see at a moment before and you're not responsible for the fact that you now see it it's just like the dominoes just kept falling right right but it does give you this a far more patient sense of one just it just you know all the causes and conditions that that have created this this odious behavior you're now disposed to react to in the world right like like you can everything on some level is more of a force of nature than it is something that you need to take personally it's like if there's a hurricane blowing outside we don't respond to it the same way we would respond to you know al Qaeda and dropping a bomb on us right it might it might create the same amount of damage but the in in the in the latter case where we have an identified entity we feel like okay now we're in the presence of human evil and we have to go kill these motherfuckers right now we may have to kill them right that may be the only way of putting out this this you know stopping the damage there they're committed to causing but and we would kill hurricanes if we could kill them right I mean we would you know we would nullify them but the feeling we have in both cases is very different the feeling you have attributing ultimate authorship to a person's behavior is super narrow psychologically and ethically and it's you know the feeling of vengeance right like like you don't you you don't you have a you this feeling of vengeance is so natural to get triggered in response to a person it's not natural in response to a wild animal who may have done something terrible right I mean like you would like I mean there's been examples of this where people have taken vengeance on animals and it just looks like a kind of moral dysfunction on the part of the people who did it I mean there's a famous picture of a an elephant that got hung from a railroad crane I think back in the 20s right so look at this the circus elephant escaped and it ran you know it rampage through the streets and it trampled you know a few people and that and the people and the in the town I don't know where this was it was a Baltimore or someplace we're so outraged that they've decided to lynch the elephant right like and yet that's there's something uncanny about that sort of misappropriation of agency to an elephant what is it what is a mistreated circus elephant gonna do when it gets out and it's terrified and it's trying to get away from people it's gonna trample a few people so we have a very different set of books we keep ethically for humans and but some of its understandable some of its inevitable but a lot of it gives us moral illusions that we don't need to have and it gives it it gives us a kind of just an inability to take stock of all the variables that are actually guiding human behavior and react to them and mitigate them and disincentivize them intelligently I mean punishment makes sense not because people really really deserve at bottom whatever their punishments are it doesn't make sense in a in a retributive paradigm it makes sense if it if it's the the best tool to discourage dangerous behavior and it works right so it's like you know if you're if you're going to punish people for things they can't control well that's stupid right because it you you as much as you punish them that you're not going to you're not going to moderate the behavior so you have to punish people for things that are actually under voluntary control and it only it only makes sense if it's the only tool to do the job and if the moment you have I mean this is a I may have brought this up last time we spoke about free will but this is really the sort of reductio ad absurdum of where most people are on this topic the moment we really understand human evil at the level of the brain the moment we understand psychopathy se which is I mean maybe that's not the totality of evil but let's you know certainly center of the bullseye once we understand psychopathy is a neurological condition that's governed by genes and environment and we can we can actually intrude at the level of the brain to mitigate it so like so psychopathy becomes a disease right it becomes a an injury a syndrome right that we can fix and let's say it's let's say it's a very simple fix let's say it's a pill right let's say it's just a neurotransmitter imbalance in the presence of that breakthrough we will feel very differently about that species of human evil we will not judge it in the same way will because what will happen is you'll give people the pill and they'll say fuck I can't believe I was that dangerous asshole like I gotta thank you for like like I I'm as horrified by who I was before you cured me as you were right and it's totally soso suck psychopathy in the presence of a cure for it would look much more like diabetes than it looks like evil in the present case and people aren't imagining what it would like what it would be like to be there what it would be like to actually fully understand the underlying neural physiology here and actually have something that means there's no guarantee we'll be able to to deal with it in a simple way but it's certainly possible and I mean the classic example is just like the Charles Whitman example where you know you have a brain tumor that's causing this aberrant behavior in that case everyone everyone sees okay this is not evil this is a brain tumor that's the tower shooter yeah yeah back in 64 I think and so but in the same way that a brain tumor tumors exculpatory there I think a full understanding of the underlying neurology would be exculpatory again it doesn't mean you in the meantime but you know before we get there we obviously we have to lock up dangerous people if there's no way to to help them but the more we see the causes the more we view this in terms of just sheer bad luck right like like there are there are people who when they're adults are quintessentially evil who we and they they provoke the greatest feeling of vengeance from us but if you just walk back their timeline you recognize that at a certain they were four years old at one point right they were the four year old who was destined to become this terrible person right it's an unlucky four-year-old right you know and so at what point where is the bright line that says okay here's the point where it's appropriate to just hate this person and feel no compassion and it on the other side of this line you should just feel compassion because this person is unlucky there is no such line and a complete understanding of this lifeline in in scientific terms would obliterate any line you think you have right it would just be this cascade of causation and you know adding randomness to the picture doesn't help right it's just it's the randomness is just you know somebody's in your brain rolling dice and influencing your behavior that way well that doesn't give you the the free will people think they have so there isn't there's ironically there is what seems on some level deflationary of the the the the gravitas of the human spirit for people opens the door to at least in my view a far more ethical and tolerant and patient and understanding view of of you know human failings and and human frailty and and just and then at that point you can just have a conversation about what's pragmatic what works what helps people change like in this this person over here who's doing terrible things is there something we can do to make him a better person well if there is let's do that without all the judgment wouldn't it be amazing if that's how we treated these public shaming events like wouldn't wouldn't it be amazing if we gave someone an opportunity to say this is this is what I did this is how awful I feel about this I would never do that again I'm a different person that was twenty years ago or whatever it is and and have everybody join in hey anyone could be you thank you for being honest about who you are now thank you for evolving thank you for expressing yourself in a way that maybe other people who have also committed really on just unsavory or just unfortunate things in the past unfortunate acts in the past they can feel relieved by the fact that you've grown and evolved to become a better person oh yeah and that you're you're a different thing now and you are the product of all of your experiences you're not you're not this one thing you're not stuck in who you were when you were 16 years old but if you were Marky Mark and you hit that guy with a stick whatever you know whatever he did you didn't you're not stuck in that spot forever these don't mark it's not a Scarlet Letter it's not a mark on your forehead that you keep for life yeah I mean I think about the Liam Neeson incident which I find so interesting is that there's a case where I mean what he's revealing about himself is is pretty amazing right it's like it's like he just decided okay we need a you know a Truth and Reconciliation Commission for who I used to be right you know and just volunteered this and for me like you know I don't actually understand that State of Mind I mean there are many aberrant states of mind that I can understand I certainly understand what it's like to want to harm somebody and you know to feel vengeance and all that but the instrumental violence piece I don't understand I've never felt like okay this type of person wronged me or someone close to me so any to any person of that type will do right like that right but that is such a problem the world over in human history yes that it is it is just fascinating ethically for someone of his you know stature to reveal that about himself and he put it in terms of of Honor I mean it's like it was an honor I mean this is what this is what what is so dysfunctional about on or culture right this is what you this is what we see more in the South and anywhere else in the country and this is what you see basically everywhere you go in the middle east is just and this is what islam inculcates to a degree that's fairly unmatched in in its community this notion of honor is does link up with this tendency to find satisfaction in instrumental violence like but when you when you try to run that software on my brain that just looks like madness right the idea that any other person will do right of a certain type right that's just you know I I don't read that resonates not at all right and so it's just damn interesting and the fact that the lesson being taken from this seems to be this is the this should be the end of your career for having talked about this in the way and again I've been you know apologies if there's some part of the story that I've gotten wrong I'm not missing or missing but it seemed to me that he was always counting this in the the horror and amazement appropriate to the to the disclosure like he can't believe he was inhabiting this state of consciousness and you know it's just an amazing thing to reveal about yourself so yeah and I'm sure he regrets every second of it yeah and that's that's the wrong fucking punchline yeah right you know and the the thing that should happen is someone with a lot to lose should be able to say you know how ugly a human mind can be this is an experience I had right this is who I was and you know how much I have to live for and how much I have to lose we have to talk about this kind of mania that can get humming in on a human brain right right we see this eight every time you open the paper you see someone in the grip of this kind of thing right it even happened to me right I think it's an amazing conversation to start in the fact that the result is just you know and an auto-da-fe is is is the problem we're trying to fight our way through it isn't it because there's too many voices I mean there's just so many people that are reacting to it if he's dealing with he's not dealing with three or four or five voices he's dealing with millions of people to get to chime in on this yeah and get a few thousand of those people that are furious at you you know like you were saying like this it doesn't doesn't that doesn't work I was just about to say I was gonna make it comparison your podcast with Jack that you're not listening to them not reading the comments but he's he's getting this gigantic signal from a huge number of people you know so this is all over my Google newsfeed I saw it on Yahoo I saw it and all these different publications are talking about Liam Neeson's case and so then everybody starts chiming in and then the virtru signaling ratio is very high and the anger ratio is very higher than the people who think he's secretly still racist and doesn't want to admit it it's very high yeah and then there's also the fact that he's a man of wealth and privilege and he's successful and famous and there's gotta be a bunch of jealousy that's attached to that and a bunch of people that want to knock him down cuz he's at a very high hill yeah there's a lot going on there and I I don't know I feel I I feel for the guy again I don't know him but I just I remember again forgive me if I get this slightly wrong but I isn't it true that like his wife Natasha Richardson just died in this freak accident but she's seen Siddhant fell and hit her head but but honestly she didn't even fall she wasn't moving when she fell she was standing on a ski slope and fell from a standing position and hit her head on the you know the hard snow obviously and I mean it's just it's all it takes yeah it's brutal yeah so and on top of that I believe his cousin or his nephew nephew or niece died the same way not the same way in terms of fell skiing but also hit their head and Ride Wow so it's like Jesus Christ this book this guy and obviously there's many people out there that experience it far greater tragedies I'm not trying to quantify it but yeah he's uh you know he he tried to talk about a real thing you know tried to talk about a real thing and he's he's given some interview since then where's you know he said I look I'm not a racist I'm just telling you I was in such a fucked up state of mind because of this rape that I was willing to do something irrational and horrible yeah but he didn't know it's what he did is interesting yeah exactly yeah but and and but again it was take it full circle people these same people who are calling for his head are prepared to forgive other people who did you know that thing right it's all it's it's so dependent like I had Mike Tyson on the podcast and one of the things that I got when I said it was um part about that was fast I've asked so many people like fuck that rapist fuck nice guy fuck that all these different things about him what I wanted to get into him with him was who he was when he was 12 years old when he was a little boy when he met custom motto and was taught out of box and was fuckin hypnotized and this is one of the really important things that came out of that podcast was custom auto who was not just this boxing legend who took in this young kid from the ghetto that didn't have a family but also hypnotized him hypnotized him to be a destroyer he specifically was saying to him you don't exist the task exists you're gonna move forward you're gonna bob and weave and rip the body and he was programming this kid to get incredible amounts of positive response from violent acts violent acts in a boxing ring and that's where he got his identity that's where he got all of his love and so he became this guy and one of the things that I said to him I said did anybody ever teach you how to turn it off he's like no no he did like I'm no I'm no Mike Tyson and I was never like that I was never like that but I was far more violent when I was fighting far more violent far more prone to violence it was my trigger was very short because I was already thinking about it all fighting all the time I thought I probably had a hundred fights I was ready to go like your your brain has if you're if you're getting kicked in the face and punched in the face a lot and you're doing it through your developmental period from the time you're 50 for me was 15 from him was like 12 or 13 you have a different way of looking at the world because this is also in the recipes yeah and the recipes are also you might get knocked the fuck out you might get head kicked you might get kicked in the neck with a shin and you know you wake up and your friends are slapped me in the face of putting ice on you this is all real and when you have that the the positive that comes from that when you're a 12 year old boy and you're hypnotized by this great man who's teaching you how to fight and you're getting so much love you've never gotten love in your life you've never gotten positive feedback and you're getting so much of it from this and then no one's teaching you how to turn it off and you're wondering why this guy would grows up to become a fuckin maniac as punching people in the street is just just crazy and yelling the reporters I'll fuck you in the ass white boy all that crazy shit that he did yeah he was a maniac I mean there's no no one taught him how to reflect there was no Sam Harris app for meditation for Mike Tyson in 1986 you know he was just a maniac boy yeah I mean one problem we have here is that we we don't have a norm around a good norm around mental health yeah and we have--we've like this zero norms around mental training right so I mean it's a physical training there's a very good analogy between meditation as mental training which sounds just esoteric and whew right sounds like new-age you know specious nonsense to many people but if you roll back the clock a hundred years physical training made no sense there was no norms around I mean the only guy lifting a dumbbell was that guy with the handlebar mustache and a leopard you know a bikini or whatever it was wearing at the freakshow right yeah you know the singlet yeah and now we have a we have a total understanding of the norms around physical training yeah oh you're just you're actually a freak if you don't do some kind of exercise well they all dos have even changed and evolved over the last decade or so yeah yeah it far more complicated and nuanced it's continually evolving but the the framework that the paradigm the fact that there's something to do to get better physically and that those those changes matter they they you can engage your body intelligently so as to improve it and uh you know many different variables flexibility strength that's all totally understood and now we're just refining the protocol with mental training and specifically the training of attention and how you respond to the the uprising of your own negative emotion right that is something that has been going on for thousands of years in contemplative mostly Eastern context and that's something that you know Buddhism really has a lot of specifically an asymmetric amount of wisdom to to share on and it's um yeah I mean I'm I'm I'm very excited to be spending more time on it because it's that the locus of so much of the fragmentation are in our lives now is the smartphone what's hat what the what this thing is doing to us is continually amplifying not only our desire for approval but the the ability to react in a like so there's just no reason to hesitate to condemn this thing that you're seeing it like your this this upwelling of negative emotion you see the out the outrage you feel when you see something on Twitter right is it's shortening everybody's views right it's making road rage more of a kind of a general feature of our of our lives and this is this is all trainable like you can actually you can actually learn that when you suddenly feel anger in response to something that seems to have you know happened in the world if you just pay attention to the experience of anger you just feel the end of the mere physiology of it and get out of your thoughts about it like you actually you notice thought as a process you let that go you're not continuing to have a calm with yourself about all the reasons why you should be angry or you should attack this person and you've just become interested in in anger as a response the half-life of the emotion is like seconds right it's impossible to stay angry for very long if you get out of the story you're telling yourself about why you should be angry now there are certain situations where angers is appropriate and it's good to have access to that energy I'm not I'm not advocating that everyone just get lobotomized and not react to anything but until you can actually be mindful I mean mindful is the technical word for what what this is and until you can actually get out of the that the thoughts and just pay attention to - in this case a negative emotion you have zero choice you're gonna stay angry for as long as you stay angry for and people have this experience of being angry for days about things we're being angry for hours there is no way to stay angry for more than moments if unless you're just lost in the story and it becomes a kind of superpower to be able to say do I need to be angry about this or like how useful is it to stay angry about this and and you can just get off the ride right you can literally like you know I see a tweet from somebody who's trying to destroy my life and I feel this initial you know contraction and I can decide how long I want to feel that way for right and that's an amazing thing to be able to do and it's based on a kind of training that very few people know even exists and that and and so again it's like you're like I'm now the guy in the in the leopard singlet right mm-hmm but it's um you know more and more we're going to understand that this is just has to be part of everybody's toolkit well it would be amazing if they were taught kids that in school if you have to learn that when you're learning math and history people are doing that if I my wife actually does that really in high school six-year-olds whoa you can't eat you can teach mindfulness too I mean in the beginning what they're learning is just basic awareness of their inner lives right like just being able to name the emotion they're feeling is an amazing capacity in a six-year-old like a six-year-old is just acting out something and you're now teaching them to know in that moment that what's pushing them from behind is sadness or anger or embarrassment or psyche like just to be able just to have that recursive ability to reflect that's already a major gain and in in kids that age but yeah you can learn it very early actually this was something I was talking about with Stephen Fry on my podcast Stephen was very skating he's actually he's adorable he's well I won't like that nicely the broadcast I really enjoyed that yeah yeah he's just here in the presence of just such a nice guy guys radiates you know decency but he was you know fairly skeptical of just like why would you ever have to train mindfulness or meditation yeah I mean the analogy that came up came up to me he came before me on the fly there was that it is actually a lot like learning to read in the sense that none of us remember having the haven't gone through the ordeal of learning to read right now that learning to read was a hassle right like that did not come easily to most people and yet now is just now you if you look at a page of text in a language you understand you can't help but decode it right it's just an effortless and so the I mean this is these kinds of emotional tools and and and cognitive tools just the ability to self-regulate emotion in by becoming aware of it as a process that is something that I think we could teach kids much earlier and then we would be in the presence of young adults who would naturally have a facility for it that where they won't even they wouldn't even remember how hard it was to acquire it yeah what I was talking about earlier with Mike Tyson and you know his his coaching and his I mean he essentially got mental coaching on how to accomplish one thing mental coaching on how to have the perfect mindset for one thing how to how to kick people's ass yeah what he didn't have was mental coaching on how to deal with the pressures of life especially life I mean and almost no one really understands what life is like to be a famous 20 year old heavyweight champion of the world I mean there's no one had to be Italian it's got to be alien I mean and to ask this kid to manage this state when you know you're talking about someone who just six years prior was virtually homeless and had no love in his life at all and was being hypnotized by some madman who's a you know a boxing wizard who lives in the Catskills and did what we were talking about earlier about who you are now versus who you were twenty thirty years ago when you meet Mike Tyson now Mike Tyson is the sweetest nicest friendliest guy he's so soft-spoken he's really kind he hugs people he's a really nice guy you know and at one point time he was a scariest motherfucker on the planet Earth yeah there's actually there's another sort of uncanny valley here in martial arts training that I spent a lot of time in when you're training in martial arts and seeing the world through this lens of violence and potential violence but your training in a way that's never really putting your skills to the test so you're you're basically your as a young man you're living with this fundamental uncertainty as to whether or not you actually are capable of anything yes so you're training in like fake martial arts right right or at least martial arts where most of it is it kind of pantomime of violence and it's not being pressure tested so it's not like you where you're competing and you know what it's like to kick someone in the head and it actually works right it's like this is your sparring but it's all yeah you have to keep everything safe right you know rowdy yeah or even if it's full contact you have headgear and you've got this is like you're not there's still basic uncertainty about what's gonna go down on the street if you know if right if it's in the presence of real violence and they're you're you know especially as a teenager you're in this fairly toxic state of like sort of always preparing for violence that it still is in you know in most people's lives a pretty low order of probability that it's going to occur and yet it's all it's also backed by this fear of you know you just kind of the ego fear maybe you're just full of shit right and you're just you're just gonna get your ass kicked if this ever happens and with someone like you know someone who's a really obvious ly someone like Mike Tyson there shouldn't there shouldn't be any uncertainty about like he's got nothing to prove he's in a bar and somebody says you know what are you looking at at minimum he doesn't have this fear of like if he if he walks away from that challenge he knows he's walking away not because he was scared maybe he's gonna lose a fistfight with this guy right he's the best boxer on earth at that moment it's it's that history he's got way more to lose than the other guy like why does he want to be rolling around in a parking lot with you know some stranger you know so it's so there's this this is very unhappy place that a lot of martial artists are in which is you know they don't actually know what they are they're capable of and they're they're living all the time with this this you know just kind of training software running in their heads and it's it's um it's a weird space to be in well it's one of the things that's so great about Brazilian jiu-jitsu exactly the Brazilian jiu-jitsu you I mean you're not getting punched and you're not getting kicked but you are absolutely going full blast and you have a hundred percent confidence once you reach a certain level that you could do that to an untrained person within its frame you are pressure testing it and you know that it works yes now you don't you know I would argue there people still lose sight of the fact that in reality people can people are punching and they're not training a lot of punching or defense and then there are weapons and then there's a guy's friend who can come up and start kicking you in your head just so you know it's like like how good an idea was it to pull guard when you know someone else can walk up but you know yeah it's within its you know within its purview yeah you're not the you're working out all of your illusions and that's yeah that's that's one reason why so many of us find it addictive you know it's just yeah there's that and there's also they're so nice yeah jujitsu people are so friendly and I think that's one of the reasons why there's some friendlies they're not carrying around all that bullshit that a lot of people carry around including you know there's some grown men that have never been in a fight in their life and they get a couple of beers in them they start talking crazy shit and I came in you don't even know how to fight you know what do you do just like crazy it's like who wants to jump into a NASCAR race you never driven a car like stop and they're talking to some guy with cauliflower ear you don't even know what that means right yeah it's I mean to be a human being is complicated to be a man in in the face of altercations with other men is uniquely complicated you know the kind of altercations that men get into the kind of bravado and chest puffing and shit-talking and the consequences of those things like you were talking about Liam Neeson his wife falling down and hitting her head a friend of mine was working in a bar and in Long Island and one of the bouncers got in a fight with some guy and punched the guy knocked him out the guy fell back hit his head off the curb and died and that happens all the time and people get knocked out they hit their head on the ground they die yeah yeah I actually I did when I before I had a podcast and I was getting my midlife crisis took the form of me getting really back into martial arts again for after a hiatus of maybe 25 years I had a lawyer who focused on a self-defense law he was he constantly dealing with cases where someone is either either claiming self-defense or it's a legit self-defense claim but they're basically screwed I mean they're like they punched someone and that person fell down on the hit a fire hydrant diet right likely so they're they're trying to beat a murder rap you know and so I just had him you know blog post had him walk me and I had a bunch of I had two people comment ask questions as well I had Matt Thornton the the who's John Kavanagh is jiu-jitsu coach asked questions in this blog post and I had Rory Miller who's a self defense trainer just just to try to flesh out all of the things you should be thinking about when you're the kind of person who is that all preparing for the possible eventualities of violence because people who train with guns or own own guns or carry knives or do martial arts don't actually understand what happens when you know the like they agree to fight somebody or they like it unless you unless your mo is and this should be your mo to avoid violence at all virtually any cost right like you're always just trying to leave the premises if there's some sort of challenge that could become violence if that's not your your mo you're just wandering into potential situations where you can find yourself in court for having shoved a guy and he you know fell into the street and gotten run over right you're like and then now you're the guy who's looking at the prospect of going to prison for you know for a murder or you know second-degree murder and so anyway I had him walk me through all of the the ins and outs of all that it was it was a fascinating conversation because yeah there are people who you know I mean they're extreme cases they're they're women who have shot their coat Allah crazy husband who's like waving a baseball bat at their heads and they're in prison for years for this you know they're just real miscarriages of justice were like the like he would think that the the you know that it would be very easy to prove that she was in fear for her life in this case and this was it was a legitimate use of lethal force it's just so hard when no one's there yeah if no one's that I mean if you have eyewitnesses or if you know it's a public thing that happens and there's video of it but you know someone does something to someone and no one's around you punch someone and they they get knocked out and they die and you say no this guy was threatening to kill me he was chasing me he was threatening to kill me I was terrified for my life he lunged towards me I saw the opening I took it and now he's dead you could go to jail forever yeah I mean that's that that's a reality I mean you should absolutely without a doubt avoid violence at all costs yeah but you should also know how to fight anyway I think that's very important it's very important yeah but very few people train so it's like in in the curriculum of the coloring how to fight you know training in in whatever martial art or arts there's in most cases very little time spent training avoidance yes right and that's that's a real missing piece because that is the most important thing to train I mean yeah that's like you you know especially if you have real skills right especially if you're walkin around armed right I mean that with one the one interesting psychological corrective that concealed-carry does for many people is that once you're walking around with a gun you realize what the problem of what what any altercation can become right like you're not gonna get into a shoving match with somebody if you're wearing a gun in your belt because like if that escalates you're pulling out your gun and then it's just a decision whether to kill somebody yeah so you know and you know I don't have a ton of experience in this area but you know for all the the firearm training I've done with people I just get you know you know I know only like former SWAT operators who are you know just out there constantly armed and these are like the last guys who are gonna get involved in anything I mean they used to be cops but now they don't even feel any burden to police and it's like it's like they're just they're retired and thematically retired right because they just recognize how a haywire anything can go for them if any any process of conflict get started and again I think this goes back to understanding how to manage your mind you know when the shit hits the fan and things go crazy it's it's very difficult for people to maintain a rational state of mind and things can escalate so quickly things can turn to violence so quickly especially with irrational people or untrained people or people that aren't aware of consequences or maybe can't process it well but and the crucial piece which I'll you know many seasoned fighters and and you know professionals don't have or you know I would think many don't have is this sort of this this valley where your ego concerns are not worked out it's like when you when you when you feel the emotional burden of a loss of face right so like if jaakko willing cuz in a bar and someone says something you know nasty to him or to his wife Jaakko doesn't have anything to prove like Jocko knows he's a badass right so Jocko knows that he just it's time to get out of the bar because he doesn't want to deal with this psychopath who doesn't know who he's dealing with but someone who's not trained like Jocko right could feel that backing down especially backing down in front of your wife or your girlfriend that is such an ego blow that you know the temptation to get into this this monkey dance where the other person is just is it's impossible to recover from it's a very dangerous game yeah yeah and people get into it all the time and I've seen so many people get into it that just don't they don't have any cards yeah yeah god damn it man just stop doing this you know I'm look yeah I've been doing martial arts my whole whole life and I'm terrified of fights I see fights is like yet the fuck out of here before this goes bad when it goes sideways you know men are just so we have thousands of years of awful DNA you know we really do we're violent and reach of thousands was variance yeah violence was imperative it was imperative for survival you had you had to be able to react and react quickly and yeah you had to know what to do with your genes are never going to make it to the next stage which is this is a controversial thing to say and I got in trouble or one of my podcast guests Gavin de Becker the security guru got in trouble in my podcast talking about the primacy of intuition here like like our intuitions are actually really good for detecting something that makes us uncomfortable about another person right and this is this becomes politically incorrect really fast right because it's like you know if you see a guy on an elevator who makes you uncomfortable you know Gavin's advice and I think I think the real Saint advice is just don't get on but there are many people who get on just because they want to prove they're not racist right or they're it's like and and I actually know someone who was in a situation like that and it didn't work out well and so I mean intuition is bad for so many things we we have terrible intuitions for statistics and probability theory and it's like we're reliably you know whole careers and Nobel Prizes have been won on you know people like you know Danny Kahneman have have shown us how it's not only that our intuitions are bad for for these judgments but they're reliably bad and we can understand there's a there's a structure to how bad they are but for judging people who are dangerous you know who give us the who make who make the hair stand up on the back of our neck for reasons we can't understand you know for where the eye contact was wrong or though or that's just the way they were you know I mean just like a what's called a witness check you know like someone comes up to you it engages you and then they look just they just kind of look to check for witnesses right now like that people don't aren't aware that that's even a thing right but when like that body language is very salient to us and and there are there hundreds of things like that that that we immediately feed that prompt you know an intuitive response and these are intuitions that are you know from a self-defense point of view are worth listening to because it's like the worst case scenario is you wind up being a little rude there yeah I like like sorry I'm a you know I can't talk but people are you know people are very dogmatically being kind of trained to ignore those kind of those kinds of intuitions what do you think those intuitions are like what do you think intuitions are like when you meet someone you go those person feels dangerous like what is that what's happening well there's a lot of it you know the gaze detection is a big one I mean we and what people do with their eyes is a is a major variable and just how we feel that you know the the relationship is going but it's and there's their micro expressions that we notice in people that we're not aware of noticing you know but like it's just there's this is this is not well understood and we're bad judges of whether someone is telling the truth I mean this is this has been fairly well said they're people who even people who work for the FBI are not you know much better than chance in detecting whether somebody's lying but there's just we get so much information by you know body language and being in somebody's presence and we get it so fast that it's again and I mean that there you whether we understand it or not there are evolutionary reasons why this is so I mean if we've evolved for anything as social primates we have evolved to detect stuff that just is a precursor to violent intent in in others you think it's just gays or do you think you can sense the energy of someone there's certainly the movements that people make when they're thinking about hitting you oh yeah yeah a certain like there's like a twitchiness to them like oh well pulled back like almost like a spring or a bow there's like a feeling you get around people that are looking to hit people yeah well there's this uh but again all of that still vision but there's you know I mean who knows we're detecting pheromones we could be detecting people's level of stress I mean just how tuned up they are you know but and that this goes beyond this is beyond just physical violence this is just you know detecting Psychopaths who are you know people who are manipulative I mean just detecting there are there ways to spot people lying you know and just you know they're there tells like you know too much information you know like the people who are giving you superfluous and superfluous information as a kind of over correction because they're anticipating that you're gonna doubt their story and so they're filling in like blanks that you don't even need filled in right and and it's and there's sort of patterns to - sort of - to that but and again we we pick up on a lot of this stuff without consciously being aware of what's going on we just know that that's like not a person I want to spend any more time with right but you know so there may be more of a literature on this that I'm then I know about but a lot of this is not well understood and I mean have people like Paul Ekman have done a lot of stuff on my con you know micro-expressions you know that goes back probably thirty years at this point and there are people who are outliers who are great at detecting micro-expressions where they really they really just understand what's going on but it's it's not and AI eventually will be if it is not there already will be much better than we are doing this I'm so scared of that I'm so scared of them getting that wrong yeah yeah right micro-expressions are funny because they remind me of microaggressions which is one of the you know one of the weirder social justice warrior things like things that used to be just slight swear someone was just like slightly rude not not even slightly just like where do you come from right speaking with an accent way from where your breasts from okay are you yeah how dare you question my authenticity yeah no aggression so it's weird that that's actually accepted that this is something they're they're actually pushing in certain schools that microaggressions are a real real thing christina hoff sommers just wrote something about or she she put something on her Twitter today about a Yale article that was written today that was put out today about documenting politically incorrect behavior so that someday in the future when someone is running for Congress or is up for Supreme Court or something like that you could go back to their college days and remember when they said something right I mean one of the examples this woman uses in this post was compared a woman to a large animal a woman's body to a large animal in a private text message that she should have oh I should have just grabbed I should have yeah and calls this guy in this this article white boy this white boy does this and the white boy with a saccharine smile does that it's like which is like overtly racist like they're just the expression like right in the way that she's describing it like it's as if this evil character slowly makes his way to run the world and he's been engineered since the time he was in college well that's it's gonna happen just by just just based on everyone's use of the tools yeah like that you know people are not diligently scrubbing they're they're digital history and there may in fact be no way to actually do it right and so they're just the trailing them you know they're not even aware of what they're trailing in social media so so I mean maybe maybe that is that will just be a cure for the problem because it'll you know at a certain point we'll be dealing with people who were basically born they were born on Facebook right like they don't even have a moment like they've got their baby picture there and everything that followed right and then it'll just seem completely untenable like let's just accuse people of everything yes everyone's guilty everyone has said that dumb thing yeah you know they because they matter of taken the worst possible way and and if they're gonna be hung from that then you know no no one will survive well it seems like that's what we're dealing with right now with in a lot of cases you know yeah yeah the what I think is really important that what you were saying earlier was that there has to be some sort of path to redeeming themselves that there has to be some accepted way that someone can go about redeeming themselves and we can allow them to reenter society without constantly bringing it up or judging them by it or always attributing their past behavior to who they are right now I mean look at this should be so simple but look at my collaboration with Maajid Nawaz right so like Raj we were on this podcast together yeah maajid was scheming to form a global Caliphate I mean the the organization he was part of him he wasn't a jihadist thankfully and he wasn't actually blowing people up but he was trying to get nuclear weapons in in Pakistan into the hands of the worst possible theocrats right this was his budget with all of his charisma and all of his energy and it's like you know mantra is fantastic and he used to a utterly nefarious purpose in my world right you know if you know how much that is an issue for me it's like Mudgett and Margit and I are just buddies now right so all I need is a clear path that he took out of the darkness to understand why he's a valid collaborator now you know actually on that point I've got people breathing down my neck to tell you that or tell your audience this is how powerful you are in Joe Rogan that the documentary is coming out on the are collaboration and it's out now it's it can be found out there it's called Islam in the future of tolerance nice and it's actually it's it's not bad it actually captures the spirit of our collaboration very well and if you know see it if only to recognize how awesome aaj it is because moderate is just a superstar and the scariest thing about the state of public opinion in the Muslim world from my point of view is just how how hard a job he has to just to have a conversation in that community I mean it's just you know he's so marginalized and he's so reasonable you know but I mean to come back to that original point here's someone who was whose life was purposed toward what you know what I view is one of the most toxic projects I can think of right you know give the nuclear weapons to the people who want to die as martyrs right that's the project right and majah tis just an absolutely awesome collaborator now right so there's like we have to there has to be a path through some sane conversation to a reboot the real the worry though for a lot of folks is that you are not really being honest about who you are currently you just want an excuse to be relieved except it's so clear in some of these cases like it's clear let me take them in the Norma Donald case it's just utterly clear yeah right and I mean even the inmate in Megyn Kelly's case utterly clear like I don't think it unless she's got some white supremacist you know side gig that I'm not aware of she's just like listen I'm clueless I said you know I didn't realize yeah well they were looking for an excuse to get rid of her honestly right but I think that even if they weren't I think that still very likely would have been the end I mean it's like even if her show had had better ratings still that could have been unrecoverable air what if she was black well they like it doesn't work the other direction right the reverse plank and she said what's so bad about blackface well they could stay on the air that's interesting I I don't know I miss it certainly would have been easier you know oh yeah yeah what if Oprah's saying who cares you want to pretend to be Diana Ross because that was the the the thing was pretending to be Diana Ross for Halloween right yeah it would be Diana Ross yeah I mean I got to think they could get away with it but it's I mean it was interesting the thing that happened with louis c.k and ricky gervais and Jerry Simon Chris Rock yes that wasn't it because I remember when that aired I think it was 2011 and I remember there was nothing around that it was it was totally fine yeah right they were using the n-word I mean the problem the thing that was too kind of dishonest about the the Reese candle isin of it was that in the context of that conversation it was framed by the fact that they really were referencing one of the more famous pieces of comedy in history and they've read they were referencing Chris Rock's act using the n-word right there they're black people and then there ends yeah and you Louie are an end right like you're the only white guy I know who and then they're so they're talking in that context and anyway yeah it was it was interested in how that almost I mean that blew back against Ricky and and yeah that's one of those things that were they're just looking for more things to be mad at Louis for yeah but it but Ricky was also getting I think the Chris Rock was a lot of shit yeah he took a lot of shit for that because he didn't there was no blowback yeah yeah interesting times yes that's probably good way to end it yeah three hours yeah it is it is interesting times I mean it's probably the most interesting times of our lives in good ways and bad ways yeah well we're um we're on the front lines or something so I mean you you know I I don't know if you get enough credit for this but you have like you pushed out into the space that no one even knew existed and I mean you're like I honestly didn't even know what a podcast was when you know like I learned what a podcast was when I got invited to get interviewed on your podcast the first time you know so it's like it's awesome what you've created here so thank you it's all it's an accident you know I just stuck with it yeah stumbled upon it yeah and kept going well I'm good at that keep it up thank you thank you you too yeah Sam Harris ladies and gentlemen [Music] [Applause] [Music]
