the girag an experience that became an issue in Abu Dhabi with a lot of wrestlers or wrestlers to take guys down and just hold them in positions and not go for submissions just try to go for points and you know and people get furious they'd be like well this isn't jujitsu but some people felt like the only way to compete with these guys is to do what they're doing is to fight smart the only way you can win is to to fight on points would you rather lose on points then win by holding a guy down yeah I have lost like that you know Dunbar the advice does I mean you don't know and you show me a good loser I'll show you a loser buddy but you know yeah I rather lose on points with keeping my mentality always with the objective tube to get into a better place then to stop my game and try to find out how I'm gonna win this match while using the time on my side so I have fought matches where I lost when I could have won I was winning on points and then I went for something or I tried to advance the position and I lost it and then dueling and then whatever the guy swept me and then I lost cuz the time right now so I have lost matches like that and it served as a good learning experience and everything and you know yeah I rather lose on points than to sit there and stop the game and wait for the time to to to run out because I don't know if I would feel like shit you know I feel like me deep inside me I have a thing that I feel like really bad if I don't try to go for the next position I feel guilty almost so you're just like my grandfather's like I tweeted something yesterday somebody sent me that I was talking about how I felt when my child was born that it was I was thinking about how crazy it must be how many different babies are being born right now if you could see them all in real time in front of you like on a giant screen would be like a baby invasion I mean you don't think about it cuz you're in that hospital room while that one's being born well somebody sent me a tweet and in that tweet is a link that shows in real time every baby being born all around the world and it is a fucking Vasia scary happen yeah it is like if Obama gave out his cellphone that's what it's like I mean it's just why baby baby baby baby baby Switzerland Africa Indonesia China and that's just the reported babies that's not the little tykes shit out in the bottom of a fucking grass hut in the middle of the jungle you know they didn't count those they only counted the ones the ones are in the census yeah I mean well look at that on those are the babies see those babies on both sides holy shit that is scary isn't that incredible yeah those are all babies it's going about deaths going about one I don't see a lot of second not a lot of us births most how is that only Google Drive calm that's all it is what's Google Drive complex ass hos oh shit so the stuff that we can't see that's all like real blurry that's the other stuff do you think this is what the NSA sees they see like every new human being coming online yeah the NSA is there paying attention 24 hours a day to every one of these babies make sure they're not fucking do anything anything so get all these babies this is crazy there's a fucking in a future run out of oxygen or something it's terrifying man and I don't see a lot of American flags either man uh-huh I see a lot of those other countries around the red Chinese flag and that bothers me as an American I think we need to do our job and do some more fucking most deaths China is number one most births India look at that it just stopped what if freaked out no but you're the computer crash now well what if they just stopped having babies what if one day we went on that thing and there was a day where there was no babies um so I did a podcast today with a guy from crack calm Dan O'Brien I wrote a really funny book called how to fight presidents to see who is the baddest ass who's the one guy you wouldn't want to fight and who would win in a fight if they were pitted against each other it's like it's in some ways the greatest book of all time and like I said I go this is this is gonna be the greatest podcast of all time it was the funniest thing because we got it heavy heated argument about who would win in a fight and you got to put a couple presents up at the top of the list you got to put Abe Lincoln because he was renowned for his physical strength there is fun he fought vampires too right well he did if what but he isn't a movie he used an axe but Abe Lincoln was 64 and had what said that disease where your arms are longer you have really long arms like longer than your body at crazyland and he was he was known to be really strong and and very very tough hey boys I think you also have to think of people that live during that era they're a lot tougher oh yeah they grew up doing everything with their hands right building things so no that's so then he said I said what about Barack Obama and he got quiet there's a comedian really good guy he got quiet and they said well I can't really you know I I'd rather leave that alone I said why I said well I tried not to you try not to include any living presidents cuz it caused too much trouble I said what do you mean he said well I went through sort of a thing about how you know Barack Obama's not that tough for president it would be easy to kick his ass and you know I was doing it tongue-in-cheek you know you probably kick him here and he's kind of skinny and you could do and he gets a call from the Secret Service because he posted it as a blog he posted as a blog from crack calm well he said the reason the only blog that's not up there anymore is that because he got called down to the federal building I believe I think that's what he said it's on my podcast and he had to go line by line with these agents on what he meant by what he was saying and he was like well I said you know I said dick tornado instead of a penis cyclone because it's kind of funnier he was trying to teach them a humor these guys were totally fucking useless he got all nervous he was like apologizing he made they made him take it down and it was a chapter there was a money from the book of Italy so that I was like we live in America how I mean now you have to be careful when you've threatened the president you will get calls but guys guys come on come on man I mean and he probably can't they probably can't well they said Robin no way to go like yeah they probably knew of course he's joking but there's a thing there's you set in motion a certain so that's what happens because they said we will subpoena everybody that made a comment yeah on your on the blog is asked and and and and Dan said well it's a bunch of fourteen year olds have fun with that and what the main guy that called them first he goes look I know you're kidding I know you got a sense of humor you gotta go talk these guys it's just the way it is pal
