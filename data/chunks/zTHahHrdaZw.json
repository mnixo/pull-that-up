two one and we're live hello Gabby hello how are you Jeff good thanks for being here I appreciate it thank you for having me you're looking well thank you you are as well I really enjoy following you on Instagram you have a very positive Instagram page it's full of information it's beneficial it's great stuff Thanks yeah you know I I feel like I'm trying to figure that out like for a younger person it's like oh yeah well this is how you do it and for me I'm like what do you really want to say and I don't know I think sometimes I I would like to take more chances but I do play it probably safe house up looking what why I try to be pretty honest but sometimes you're always very aware that you just I'm not interested in getting roasted or spending a lot of time and energy in a hassle with somebody so I think when I'm doing it I'm as honest as I can be but I'm it's also I'm aware of that what do you hold back on like what kind of stuff I think for me it would just maybe just be more even maybe more direct but you're you know I think when you're trying when you sort of say okay I'm gonna occupy this space professionally that feels good to me and like I want it to be overall pretty positive you know like if you're selling something like maybe I'd like to try to sell something positive but hopefully towards the honest a little bit right and sometimes when you're doing that you're also aware that like you're not as harsh as sometimes your inner voice is and so you go oh my not being it's completely honest and transparent because I don't really want to deal with it and right so I'm just saying because you don't want to deal with feedback comments yeah and it's and it's also just people who are frustrated or or or also they're not getting maybe the nuance or the subtlety of what I'm trying to say let's just say that social media is not the place for subtlety no not in the comments for sure right right so I just I I want to do stuff that seems like that seems often you know pretty real but hopefully skewed towards like either fun or something positive one of things that I've recognized from doing a podcast is that some of the frustration when people do lash out yeah and you're like this is like out of proportion some of it is due to the fact that it's very frustrating to just not be a part of the conversation if you disagree with like when you're listening to just a fundamental the this the act of listening to someone have a conversation and something comes up be like but what about that that's a great point say that and it's like this you get stuck yeah so then you leave it a shitty comment yeah oh my god that guy's a dick but this point his frustration of not being able to communicate interject it's like your kid who would be like hey hey hey may never get to buy in yeah that's a great point I think you've probably been tempered by doing this and have probably looked at it from a lot of different points of view because you have to yeah you have to I've tried no it's it's been interesting to like watch you over the years I think what's interesting is watching you have an interesting place where you keep your own you sort of keep a level of neutrality even though you have an opinion so you let other people express themselves whether it's about a religion or vaccinations or whatever I think that it's been interesting to see like you develop that skill even more well it's hard for people to express themselves as it is like live on a podcast is difficult it's harder still if you don't allow them to if you interject and you know as well as that we all know that when someone when you have something you're trying to say and then someone talks over you it's fucking frustrating and when you're trying to formulate these words than someone butts in and then you lose it it's hard so that's one of the key skills of learning how to communicate with people that I think a lot of people lose is the ability to listen you know and also you have to have a good enough memory so you can hold on to what you were going to say and then allow this person to elaborate on their thoughts and then when you give them the respect and allow them to elaborate on their thoughts hopefully they'll return that favor and they'll allow you to elaborate on your thoughts and then you get a much more balanced conversation but there's so many people talking where they're just talking over each other and shutting each other down or taking the conversation into a a weird place it's just the only way to find out how someone feels about something is to let them express themselves and if people get mad that I don't push back it's like that's not always the best way to find out how a person feels you got to let them let them talk right I want to know I want to know the whole thing I want to know as far into this as you can tell me why you think this like instead of me just saying no you're wrong I want to I want you to explain it to me I want to know whether or not I trust your process do you bring that skill home with you yeah I mean you're surrounded by women's trough it's tough bro I'm serious like sometimes because I even see it with my own husband we have three daughters but I mean especially you know when you have a pretty masculine male I'm always fascinated to watch them navigate their home when they're surrounded by women I just give up most of the time I lose every argument I think you know I tried to we communicate a lot love talking with girls it's always those things they're crying about like okay okay okay we're gonna be fine and you know I don't want them to be like me I want them to be themselves and I want them to be girls I wanted to be able to be themselves I don't want them to mirror my resilience you know I want them to be vulnerable if they want to be vulnerable but it's uh in terms of like how I decorate the house or any I don't have no say oh no nothing you know that's why you have you know I have this place I was gonna say you have your your cave here Laird has a barn perfect and he you know when he meets young guys getting married he goes here I'm gonna teach you okay you're right honey I'm sorry and oh yes whatever color you choose you know always work some people it's never enough but if you have the right relationship sometimes it'll work that way cuz I don't give a fuck what my house looks like I really don't know I have a good view where's the coffee yeah okay good real work yeah okay how's the bed that's a good bed do we have a TV where's the TV is it a good one I also get TV all right we're good we're good I have a laptop okay we're good yeah yeah I don't need that much now you know so like when my wife's like gonna put this okay put it there fantastic I want to get that painting okay get the painting I don't know I don't know why you want to put it yeah put it where it feels right I don't give a fuck it's I think it's smart I I mean you know like sometimes if I am fringe on if it's functional then layered steps in like you know that's not really functional but otherwise he's like I'm tearing some stuff out of my house right now and he just gives me a look and I'm like I'm this age if I want to do this support me I need this laughs and walks out yeah he does probably didn't care go ahead just yes it's in the way whatever it is whatever have fun with it yeah is what time's dinner you know love to decorate things I get nervous it's really into it well yeah it's a nesting trip yeah guys are like really into like like design in in their own house like really really into it like constantly obsessing about where things are and we're like homosexuals yeah what do you mean is that a stereotypical thing that is outrageous was that racist that might be you might have showed your white supremacy I'm not exactly sure yeah it's a funny thing right but if I didn't have this place though I don't know if I'm like traditionally men had pool halls they could hang out it or gyms that they would hang out in and they would get their dose of toxic masculinity yeah our basement where a basement yeah you kind of need a place where nobody's touching your stuff oh yeah well if you live in a house like I do with all girls too it's it's just everything's girly I just did whatever I'm fine Laird says he's like I needed to be more specific I said I wanted to be surrounded by women I didn't mean be related to all of them that's hilarious you know it's I think it's nature God's way of balancing off they say if guys have elevated body temperature so athletes people train a lot that they're statistically have a greater chance of having daughters because I think they hot we call it hot balls basically if it kills off the male sperm that's hilarious and if you know I think so they did a thing on a bunch of guys either in the NFL or whatever and statistically they just have a lot more daughters huh and I think it's like nature's way of going oh you're gonna be all like moving and active and rah and all this stuff guess what just gonna put a bunch of girls around for you or say things to my husband I could never say as a wife mmm you know it's like I see it and I just go oh yeah well they know that for sure he loves them so they carried away with it they're in yeah they can't get fired no I always say that to them my youngest daughter when she was really little like five or six she'd say okay so I'm not really clear with this when I have alone time I'm by myself and when you and Dad need a long time like you're together and I try to like well you know it's important for moms and dads because you know we have to work it I go you know you're you're always gonna be dad's daughter I you know I'm we're working at being a husband and wife and then she'd keep going with it and I finally would just say like hey do you want to have Christmas in separate houses and I'd see her think for a second like well maybe you know she's processing that she's like I miss you but I don't know you know so it's all that dance you know know cuz daughters man they don't miss a trick and they're on you and they're on their dad like nobody's business well my friends that have sons the way they say it is it's like you take one of two things either you have this wild animal that's tearing things apart or you have someone who's screaming and crying about something you don't understand yeah take your pick you know yeah a mental destroyer or a physical destroyer yeah walls with holes and Bochum broken bones boys and girls it's like I have learned so much being a mother two daughters and I've been around women my whole life you figure playing volleyball being around tons of women it's very different as a parent I mean I've learned the most especially teenagers watching them grow so strange it's such a strange experience watching a person figure out the world from from jump you know like out the womb figure out the world it's so educational I feel I don't think everyone should have children I'm not one of those zealots that tells everybody hey you're not alive till you have a kid no it's unfair to say that defeat it is unfair I think it's first of all a lot of people can't write and maybe they have a just a different path like I always do my girlfriend's too like it's unfair also to romanticize like to your friends who either opted not to have children or whatever met a partner too late or didn't or whatever because I think it is a really rich I mean there's nothing like it I mean I love my children but if I had one friend she was like got married later and she was like you know we're gonna adopt and she was also doing a new business and I was like listen I need to come I want to talk to you and she also like to consider taking naps occasionally I was like if you think you're gonna adopt and like you're gonna have a 12 year old that's like hey I really appreciate you guys thank you so much I go that's not what you know like if you think you're gonna have a kid and it's gonna make you happier that's not what having a kid is I think it makes you it makes you know yourself better in a different way and you can adapt and do something different but I think when people sort of sell that bill of goods like you gotta have kids it's like well do you want to have kids you know I think it's like you said not for everyone you definitely shouldn't adopt you think it's gonna be easy that's what I mean I get a romantic idea of like and I go you know you don't first of all you don't know what the what's where the kid is coming from and then also you have a roommate I think every parent going into it has a romantic idea I did and I'm a pretty realistic person of like I'm gonna do all these things right and it we're gonna be you know running in sunflower fields together and my kids are never gonna think my music sucks or I can't drive and then you realize I had a friend tell me everyone gets their turn in the barrel no matter what you do yeah you got you have to navigate stuff you're gonna have to deal with stuff yeah and on the other hand it's awesome when someone does a dot people if they're really into it if they know what they're getting into and those martyrs out there and those people that are just super kind and generous and love to adopt children that god bless them yeah so glad they were there yeah it's just I agree with you that there are some people that have a romanticized idea of what it's like to raise a child and it's unfair to to sell it like I love the mom shucks what so when you can have number two or whatever to somebody it's like oh you know that they're behind closed doors doing you know like they just want everyone to be in the psychotic nests with them I have three kids you should have three kids you know there are people like that right they did yeah there's people that have a kid that immediately take this moral high ground like yeah like they're doing something they're an adult and you're you're just a fool yeah you're like I wonder who is the fool yes it's I ask myself that sometimes well don't you think you're a better person for raising kids does it make you feel like you're more in tune and nicer and just more aware of what it is what it means to be a human yeah I not only that I I feel like I feel like it's it's a forced exploration if you're trying to participate like if you just lay down the law and go hey in this house this is how we do it then you're not doing anything but I think if you you've learned to adapt and also go wow I was doing that wrong for like ten years amazing you know like I've one of my daughter's at 12 or 13 sort of revealed some stuff about what she was unhappy about about my parenting and I was like god I've been doing that for a long time so I think it's it's cool that she had the confidence to do that though yeah it's so cool I wanted to hear that like when she was 30 at the Thanksgiving table she moved out I was like what you're supposed to reveal all that like after you move out and then I go oh what did I do that sorry what time's your flight no I know listen it's a it's a surrender I think for me it's been a real surrender because I I just think I you think you're in control of stuff and you think I've got some discipline and work ethic I just work my way through it or power my way through it and then you realize like no you have to surrender and and also it's not just about solving it quickly and yeah it is I'm I know myself certainly better but also it forces you if you're willing to to really expand yeah and it sunk it is uncomfortable well I've been I've been really fascinated by the life that you guys live in Hawaii then it's because I've always had this like idealized I'd like one day like come but move to the big island just chill on the side of a mountain stop fucking around fly out to do gigs but live out there where everything's just more relaxed yeah you know is it okay you know there's a lot going on and like the Big Island is obviously big city yeah no it's big yeah it's sort of like LA on the beach but you know there's a couple things I think because it is a primal environment like we live on kawaii which is pretty heavy-duty as far as um it's quiet there's not a lot of distraction there's a really heavy-duty nature and and so and I grew up in in st. Thomas on the Virgin Island so I was used to kind of being on an island but you're you're with yourself a lot so if you have things to do that are you know productive then it's perfect but what you have to always calibrate is like the downtime or it like it's been raining off and on for like over a year on Hawaii whoa yeah so after a while it'd be like Seattle in that way where people it starts getting heavy but it's sunny too right it can be and that's the weirdest thing about the islands yeah that there's different climates on this I like the Big Island has desert yes it has tropical rainforest it has a volcano it's all the show every I think it has every weather climate except Arctic I believe at least Maui and the Big Island have sort of every type of climate it's crazy that just a little bit further down it'll be different it'll be raining constantly yeah exactly you just go the other side and it's completely drying or they have dwarf trees because they never see the Sun but then they're you know 200 feet in the places that it's sunny it's it's trippy and you could drive around the whole thing and like how many hours does it take you to drive around the Big Island oh the Big Island I don't know like four hours or something I'm saying I think so maybe a little more yeah you like the big island love it interesting I like Maui you do that's my favorite every Islands different there all their personalities are different but I like it I mean we've been doing this for over 23 years when I met Laird he was big waves sort of come in winter so when low pressures bring snow like to the rest of the mainland that low-pressure can also bring big waves and then my season was summer so we sort of went back and forth and that's a really good blend because you you can come to California and be like oh it's a busy world I can see a lot of people I can learn stuff I can do stuff and then I also makes you appreciate when you go back to Hawaii you're like clean air really clean water very beautiful place some of the ways the ideas about the way they live there it's it's simple in a good way I don't mean that in any way like a derogatory it's like they're not trying to they're not angling and trying to get somewhere it's like no we're living right but it can be also very a really hard place a really hard place how so well I think you know and you're also talking about a warrior culture right Polynesians so you have like this this very intense love and you know when they talk about the Aloha spirit generosity they have like this and then they're very powerful people as well and sometimes if they're lit not living as they're in their most natural way that they were supposed to and then you couple it with you know there's not a ton of opportunities there it's hard to live there it's far away it's expensive and and sometimes you know it sounds cliche but it's like we really do as human organisms either need to be busy so like okay working from sunup to sundown for our food which is how it used to be and then you're just so tired you just go to bed and it's pretty simple and let's just survive it or in the world that we live in now it's like how do we get people doing things that are kind of productive and you think oh I just switched sit on the beach and look at the mountain and it's like yeah after a while you get bored and if you're a warrior you're either going to you know do something with that that is good for you or you might not so I think there's there's a lot a lot of that there I've learned a lot from that culture but it I mean they're pretty powerful they're powerful group and you know it can go the other way pretty quick where it's you know if there's drugs and alcohol or you know beefing and like it's all that so it's if that was really disturbed when I found out how much drug abuse there is on some of the islands yeah crystal meth is actually sad well it's it's again it goes back to bored I'm like thinking about when your kids have to stay home for one day you know you know it's just and now we have all these the internet and all this stuff so now you want you sort of think oh the rest of the world has a perfect they're all busy and doing fabulous perfect things and and it's hard like you got to find people that you're like let's do something let's go I mean can you train alone every single time no so you'd have to have a tribe of people that are like let's go do this activity and sometimes they don't it's not that easy well so there's there's you say there's 70,000 people on the island on kawaii kawaii probably the least inhabited it's the oldest island so it has the most erosion largest beaches and that's where a layer grew up and it's so really the nice the least inhabited of the islands isn't it well yeah I mean I don't it's not that I don't count it yeah I mean of the bigger I'm right yeah Molokai man you wouldn't you don't you don't mess with Molokai no no that's like that's like you but you got asked permission to go hang out over there really well kinda yeah it's cool though cuz it's like if you know they were like no you got a you can't you're out you gotta go really totally so is it great so it's just the people that live there you can't like move to Molokai yeah I mean like you know iid better has a place on Molokai yep and it had for many many years but I think he probably asked if that was gonna be cool yeah interesting yeah it's and it's beautiful do you have some friends I just went hunting there yeah beautiful yeah they're hunted access deer yeah on Molokai yeah it's a beautiful place and the people are amazing but you you it's not like oh I'm just gonna buy a house there right build a house there's no way no way oh wow that's interesting all these different islands have their own like rules well Neil is you can't even you can't go there you're not even allowed to go no I didn't even know that was an island yeah it's off of course adnd hey ow Nikki ow yeah ow it's give her that Jamie's big fan of me yeah yeah no it's hot like they probably have you know the largest percentage of pure of Hawaiians there hmm so it's cool I mean pretty that's gotta be a great like I found that like there's a big difference between the the culture of say Maui versus the culture of lanai lanai is more Island Dee to me whereas Maui seems like a little bit gentrified well also the wind because it Maui so windy yes it brought all the Europeans in the 80s cook to windsurf so you're also have not only mainland us and then Japanese culture you know 80s now you're talking about Europeans from wind and wind surfing so it has a lot going on I think Maui it was almost like a surprise how quick it developed and they never had a chance to get on top of it if that makes sense it does make sense yeah it's so populated it's also like so it's so La it's so Beverly Hills I lived there for 13 years Jared yeah there was a wave there that Laird was having a love affair with for many years so we lived there with you know so he could be close to his girlfriend for so strange it know every boy needs their girlfriend every boy needs a wave they do well girl you know just something that's what at least I think is kind of natural is at least for my experience is like I don't know if you ever go through this when you go home I'll little go out and surf for many hours like he can go on for five hours at a time and if their surf and it comes home and I see how happy he is like to see us like loves us he's like oh my girls you know and then about I don't know seven and a half eight minutes in he he starts to get this look on his face like oh yeah I'm in the house like family you know I wanted to do a book years ago called death by domestication because it's like how does how do how does he manage both of those sides like I need to go I need to be free I need to you know chase things and like scare myself and do all this stuff and then you know comes home and it's like you know on the floor laying you know with one of my daughters and and being attentive and a great husband and all these things but I always get amused a little bit by the push/pull yeah well especially I think with the big wave surfer mindset a good type of person those are like some of the freest wildest humans on the planet it's a very unusual group of people that rides giant waves of water on the top of the ocean I mean that's a that's a crazy thing to dedicate your time to think about it I tried not to think too much about it cuz I did marry him but there's some stuff I mean and weirdly you know he's been doing this so long that you realize hit he's actually even more different than some of the other guys because if you think about it he's sustained doing this for right now forty years so he's a guy who he has both so what he wants to do is write a huge wave during the day and then be with his family at night and sometimes you know it would take going you know halfway around the globe or whatever and so I think the pursuit and they have to wait a lot that's the other thing these things don't come around that often right it's it's very interesting to live with because there's a there's a little bit of suffering that goes on and sometimes Laird will say to me because he's aware of time going by he'll be like you know I have a lot more waves I need to ride and I'm like I know like it's a pretty deep calling and now that I mean he's been filing for 25 years but now that they are getting that equipment better it's sort of like now we can ride places that we couldn't that we're not really attractive for riding on top of the surface of the water even if you towed it so now it's opened up a whole other pursuit for him yeah it's very nice as to why you would go towards that like lair just put me on a ski in front of a wave that's like 60 feet right and like being on the back of a ski with him driving there's a moment where you go okay I actually and I'm sure you've experienced this with other friends that take you maybe on flying or something he is this is what he does right so I'm like okay I trust him more than I'm afraid that's fine I can do that and I'm gonna surrender to that I'm not gonna torture myself the whole time I'm just gonna trust him and you turn and there's a six story building behind you moving and you just think who would who like how is that fun knowing how is seeing like I'm going to actively ride that but now what the foils because they're actually catching the energy below the surface of the water what's up foils I'm not they have these things called Hydra foils so originally there's a guy named Mike Murphy who created something called the air chair and they were they've been putting foils on like water skis and different funky ways like even in the 50s so Laird and his friends got an air tear and cut the chair off and put us snowboard boots bindings quick-release so you stand on it you're booted in and below is this basically a mini airplane with a strut so for example yeah there's a shot of one and this is a smaller one Jamie do you have any ones have the big with the boots I think this is what people are using did you know what about this Wow he knows about everything what are you talking about he's plugged in his plugged in look at him you have a girlfriend well what happened to this dude's head oh yeah so there's Laird on the left obviously so you see how he there in the boots and also he the reason he looks so puffy is he has floatation underneath his wetsuit so if you hit your head or what have you but it's basically a miniature airplane underneath the surface and if he gets into trouble if they wiped out they have a quick release but now they've gotten this developed so that he can do it without the boots because that adds an element of danger that because you're strapped in you're strapped in and you're strut is you know four feet long you know that's so strange looking yeah but what's going on below the surface so there's a miniature airplane do you have Jamie do have any pictures of it flipped up I'm sure if you look on Laird stuff you can see the bottom it's like a miniature airplane because water is denser than air so it's sort of like a miniature plane and it is like the Oracle guys that do those boats do have made foils for Laird it's yeah so those are kind of more low performance ones when you see the high performance they I mean you know aerodynamics hydrodynamics it's all of that so now what you're doing is because there's energy below the surface moving so we think of a wave like pushing and dropping but there's actually the energy circular energy below so now you've got the foil that can ride that but you're not you don't have drag so like they can go there's a wave on kawaiii where they're going over you know 50 they go about 50 they can go up get up to 52 miles an hour so imagine if you did something well you've you know dedicated yourself to martial arts it's like but then there's like a new way to do it and so he's been doing the big stuff for 25 years but now they're getting the equipment right that he can ride ways that actually wouldn't be that great but now they're super fun oh wow so he gets it makes him excited and he still pursues it and that's how that's on Kauai right there and see how it's not even breaking where he rides it yeah so it no drug correct and it's it's actually riding the energy below the surface which you know for him he's just interested in what's the most efficient way I mean look at that you'd never entered in regular surfing be able to ride that so it enables them so much fun you're flying that's incredible that's what it's the difference right so they're flying so that's I think keep kept him interested but you know his his pursuit of this is it's pretty it's pretty it's a pretty interesting relationship to watch I think it's important I mean as a female for me I think playing volleyball help me understand like having a pursuit you know like something like you I got to go do that and I think it's something about living with a person who has a pursuit other than like I need a bigger war chest or whatever right that's can be really cool is when when you're riding that thing and there's the little airplane under the water is there any risk of something thinking that airplane is a fish no animals are pretty smart oh yeah I know I think I mean I know sharks don't have great vision and I think Laird is you know hit a home a turtle you know not got anything but I like Gray's did or something but those animals are pretty smart right but I was thinking the Sharks know that's what I mean like maybe a Marlin that thinks it's fish yes jacket I don't think they want to have anything to do with that thing though just the speed and the shape and also a lot of those animals don't want to get in that turbulent it's still near a wave but you know what maybe you never know and if I hear of a story I will definitely call you and tell you because I'll be like Marlin came out but those guys are smart all those animals Marlins are smart whoa I mean they know usually I know sharks again don't have great sight but they're not like huh I think they understand what's most times what's food obviously shiny things and things like that but but there are instances of people getting hit by sharks right and Hawaii's a big one isn't it it's worse as far as like more in South Africa's really a lot of sharks no Hawaii has there for sure but nothing crazy I there's a story that happened like three weeks ago on Kauai in Hanalei Bay this guy great surfer finishes his ride jumps off his board and jumped onto a shark oh Jesus Christ and a shark like turned I guess and sort of grunt he was a firefighter this guy and like graze his leg and split and I think it's just a reminder that sharks ultimately really don't want to have anything to do with you I mean maybe hammerheads may be a little more aggressive bull shark is the most because I think right they have the most amount of testosterone of any animal mm-hmm they're the ones that can go to freshwater - yeah the Bulls so they're sort of more actively aggressive but I mean I don't think a shark you're not good eating I watch the television show they took they found bull sharks way up the Illinois River that'd be scary whatever river it is in Illinois I know what river it is but they found him deep in freshwater yeah these sharks make their way all the way from the ocean and then Jamie do you think about the testosterone I think of any animal they have the largest amount of testosterone or something like that they're mean little fuckers yeah they're they're responsible for that the actual news incident that influenced the creation of the movie Jaws oh really yeah it happened in the river in New Jersey in Jersey can imagine a river like a freshwater river these people getting murdered by sharks like yeah really yeah know that yeah that's what it was based on they didn't know that these fuckers can swim way up into freshwater and they just got a hold of people got a hold of a few yeah because those buggers are a little more aggressive yeah they're supposed to be the most aggressive right yeah yeah but I I think you know for me with the sharks like even jaws impacted me with that soundtrack and I was living in in the Caribbean mmm and it's just like I don't know my kids that whenever my one daughter is like oh can I get this movie on sharks I'm like no because we live in Hawaii like I can't be watching that stuff yeah struck testosterone myth busted oh it is Scientific American yeah oh it's not real no oh yeah yeah it sounded good though it did didn't it yeah much more likely to I'm the bull shark yeah but a tiger shark would sound even meaner mm-hmm no bulls are meaner than tires yeah they say bull and hammer are more aggressive Tiger oh yeah layered and my daughter Reese just went do you know Mike molar at all photographer shoots sharks I know he is okay he's he does amazing stuff but they go and they dive so he took Reese and Laird they went for like four days and they go in the cage with the great whites out at the Galapagos and they said it's pretty far out you should do that sometime fuck that come on it with a shark gets mad fucks up the cage but people are probably doing stupid things maybe no no I just you'll do things like we're guys hit each other in the head but you won't go sit in a cage that seems normal to me they say that once you see them under that you have a different feeling they'll like you're not it's not that you're not as scared but you you just see them a little differently not just like a predator right Laird says you can see the people their eye and everything did you hear that Canada has their banning whale and dolphin captivity I think it's great I think it's great too they apparently just passed I mean how about blackfish one documentary and it like kind of I think initiated a movement oh for sure yeah people didn't know they needed to just see it in a digestible form instead of having to go seek it out and read articles about it and news reports instead of that they get to see it there it is and a very digestible for me though oh my god this is chaos this is horrible is it a transit atrocity you're taking these incredible animals that are probably some of the most magnificent creatures that evolution has ever created and you're putting them in a fish tank you're putting them in a swimming pool yeah there's their fins gorilla yeah that's crazy well actually if you think about the killer whale I mean that's the king yeah just a crazy video that I just watched yesterday of one killing a beach seal it injured the seal and the seal tried to make it over into and it literally beached itself smash this seal and those just blood everywhere and these bunch of people are standing around watching it going holy shit yeah and then it flopped its way back into the water and swam off it didn't eat it yeah okay go well that's what I mean listen that's the thing about nature right it's it's it's kind of brutal but it's not personal to see the you know those whales not like you know that seal gave me kind of a funny look right I'm gonna go and give it to him it's like oh there's some food did you ever see the one when they're on the iceberg and they look oh that bugger still holding on and then push it again and there was a mother teaching its calves at a hunt to mark that she was setting it up but showing like you can make him slide like watch this well slide well I was listening to my friend Stephen Ellis podcast and he was talking about the difference in the orcas in the Puget Sound and that their local orcas which are essentially salmon specialists yeah and they don't eat animals they don't eat marine mammals but then there are other ones that travel into the area and they are marine mammal specialists so they all they eat is like seals and and and things along those lines and they have a totally different language totally don't understand each other they don't interact with each other it was that every pod has its own language it's crazy they they put a whale in captivity once and it was not eating because they didn't know it was a seal eating whale not a fish eating well and so it learned I used to joke can you imagine like okay Susie and Billy we're gonna go watch the you know the Orca Shamu and then the trainer's they're like throwing it seal like that would not work out well like yay that trick again yeah give it a slab of cute little animal ya know so it's a they're very complex yeah well it's if it didn't exist it would be way more interesting than Bigfoot Yeah right everybody's like so into Bigfoot being real like yeah I don't get Bigfoot can you talk to me about that like do you think what it what is what's the concept of Bigfoot I mean I know okay it's a big hairy guy but yeah what I mean really come on what is it most likely there was interaction between human beings and something called the Gigantopithecus for thousands and thousands of years it's a giant bipedal hominid that existed in Asia that was between eight and ten feet tall it was real and it was basically in like the orangutan family it looks almost orangutan like but enormous and that was a real thing okay and they didn't find out about this like the 1920s they found a tooth in an apothecary shop in China and an anthropologist examine his tooth it was like where the fuck did you get this and they they took them to the site and they dug up more things and bones and jaw bones and they determined from the jawbone I'm sorry if I'm fucking this up scientists but they determined from the jawbone that they think it was bipedal that it stood up on two legs and so then they said well how big would this thing be and then in the proportionate yeah like the feel you've seen what one a real one looks like yeah I just sometimes I when they say like Oh up in Michigan I'm like is it really like what are they seeing bullshit most of it is people seeing shadows and the trees they want to believe it's Bigfoot and there's some bears that are walking on two legs but if there was a thing what's really interesting is that's where it would be because if it did come across the layering the the bearing a land bridge like they believe humans did if that did happen the many animals met and navigated from there to here that way that's where Alaska and the Pacific Northwest that would be the the natural path and then if you think about how densely wooded that area is that would be a natural habitat for something that's hiding from people the problem is you can't hide from shit anymore it's just another things our theyetee from space some something would catch you on a trail camera some there's trail cameras they're everywhere they're 4k like did you see those these a guy and his father got caught poaching a mother bear in her den it's you know it's horrific it's horrible it's not just horrible because they poach this mother bear in their den and left the babies essentially to die but they were talking about how they're not going to get caught doing it like no one's going to tie us to this and the way they were caught there was a 4k camera that was right behind them that was that was observing this this whole area where this bear was dead in they have these trail cameras now that are incredibly accurate they're so like it's so high-definition super clear and the audios clear they would catch while I was walking things yes there was something else out there but I think there is something to be said for or the Tooth Fairy and thinking we don't know everything yeah like them's fun the magic of stuff unknown and behind I I mean for me it doesn't have to be Bigfoot but I love I love the idea that we haven't seen everything we don't know everything and obviously we know that with space and who knows you know in dimensions and time and universe but something mythical is pretty fun well what's interesting is that there was a bunch of different kinds of humans that's what's in training and they found these bones and Russia that I think they call them the Denisovans they they found a set but this is within the last 10 15 years they found a completely different species of humans that lived in Russia they found those little people on the Isle on a Flores that was only like 10 years ago I mean there's there's probably dozens more that they just haven't uncovered somewhere so if there was at one point time some big giant hominid it's totally possible yes don't think you would have to eat so much to be alive today yeah beef tea constantly it's like a bear yeah like you find bear shit everywhere where's the where's the gorilla shit with the Bigfoot shit whatever it is it city is it eating plants is it eating animals what the fuck is it eating right it's gonna eat a lot a lot that's mean big they only have a six foot something husband at home and he eats a lot a lot a lot all surfing all day that that dude could put it down he can put it down you know a preposterous amounts of food it's now de big each meal or do you sort of go okay dinner and a day what what's your big home it's just white how you feeling yeah it depends like sometimes I have giant meals for dinner but sometimes when I worked out too hard at night I'll have a giant breakfast right well I just have feet I just do whatever I feel like doing but I definitely always have intermittent fasting it's at least six days a week I took 16 hours off one day I don't give a fuck it's amazing how much food we don't really need yeah it is amazing I used to eat way too much in like way too much protein and stuff when I was playing and going through different phases of training um now do you go into like a toffee and do all that - no okay no I'll explain that to people yeah well yeah it's just one sort of step a bigger just a deeper step when you when you you know do a little bit intermittent fasting is if you don't start the digestive process so if you just had you can have water and caffeine you can't have fats and things like that the theory is is that whatever cell you know dysfunction you have you kind of can rinse out kind of three times the amount the process of when you do intermittent fasting so it can be a really effective way when you're in a minute fasting to say okay I'm going to pick this four hour window for most people probably be between like three and seven or two and six and I'm gonna eat and then the rest of the time I'm not going to so it's it's very close it's just sort of one more twist they can put on it I think it's like eighty Opio mmm you know so that's a 20 hour fasted window every day yeah and I have a friend who was doing it pretty regularly and heaps - he looked different really yeah please way ya know he did he shifted his body composition a little bit and it was interesting and there's some interesting data I'm sure Jamie can give you the download on it yeah tava gee it's just sort of like one notch higher it's not fun but I you know like for me it would have to be kind of I would want to eat between 1:00 and 5:00 I could do without it the rest of the time and you can have like I said caffeine and water it's incredible what a pull mouth pleasure has like my kids bought these Entenmann's cupcakes there's any mins that's like old school old school but they are bullshit these cupcakes they're like what those chocolate frosted things the white on top a little white squiggly and the inside is a cream filled goddamn was delicious but while I was eating and I was like what the fuck are you eating man this is all nonsense you should be touching this no but you can't do that I think once you because we pretty strict loads are a little more strict than I am I think if you're gonna eat that cupcake you enjoy it yeah I think B you know even having that small conversation with yourself is a colossal waste of time as you shove it in your mouth and it goes it's like because that's so human right like it's like I shouldn't be doing this but here I go you know why am I do it why I shouldn't you know it's like I think it's important to do it and enjoy it but yeah that's not food that's like I don't know what that is we had eaten and I was full but that looks so good like if someone had cut a piece of steak and put it in front of me I'd be like I'm good laughs I'm stuff but I saw that cop kids like I can't eat anymore what's for dessert I have a separate space for that that doesn't change cuz we're older I still have a separate space it's just you know try not to use it so much well they say that for people that are in like competitive eating competitions too though you can still eat fries because fries are you don't like fries I just have the vision of a shoving it in the water and then the bun and the hotdog and then like you know squeezing it down yeah yeah that you can eat fries cuz what it's not protein no it's uh it's the saltiness and the the the carbs you could still eat you can always eat another carve yeah like if you ate a steak right and that steak was big 18 ounce ribeye you ate the whole thing but oh but then you see those fries like all over those fries and dip immense ketchup oh you could keep eating you could eat another thousand calorie that's when you're in that food like trance yeah you get those food trances yeah I mean you have people I have friends that like you know if you have any like thing out on the counter that's snack ish like you have it for the kids right and your friends that come to visit and say hi and they're kind of fidgety and all of a sudden they're just like eating everything and you just look at her like girl like you're in a constant food like trance knack it like don't have snacky you know anything around and it can't help themselves oh no cannot yeah for sure no I but I find it easier I don't know if you found it easier like I had it I just have a really heavy chocolate trip heavy like I used to have a chocolate drawer like the whole thing noburo like every kind of chocolate like get open it and it wasn't like a spin drawer it wasn't like a silverware with drawer it was like a deep drawer every kind of chocolate and I I mean stress yeah bust out the chocolate you know whatever right before your time chocolate kid walks in the room they stain something you're like chocolate I had every kind and it work it does but then I stopped eating it as much and now it's like I don't even really want it as much it's weird I really love dark chocolate with peanut butter.you oh yeah I some dark chocolate like jiffy oh yeah so I'm skipping me some bullshit peanut butter I like the crunchy stuff too so yeah because the healthy stuff somehow and the oil and the stuff is separate you need that stuff that has like those unknown yeah chemicals to make it really smooth do you like this natural peanut butter this isn't good it's not smooth look at that natural peanut butter you gotta get that fucking butter sandwich you rip a hole in the bride you're like it's annoying yeah now forget it it's either too dry or too oily yeah it doesn't work it's never perfect you can't make a sandwich with it there's a sorry he did a stir for you got to commit to a five minute stir before you ever even think about putting that shit on your bread absolutely hey so you know I was thinking I wanted to invite you you could bring whoever you want to come pool train with us what's pool training what do you guys do Jamie can you pull up like pool training or xpt pool training xpt was that Sam for this is another thing that we do but this kit this is like a 12 year old former training we built this pool and layered you know it's always trying to you know athletes in their offseason and we were like his cracked like six of our friends we built this huge pool and there's like okay take some dumbbells and go down there's Kyle job Kingsburg yeah you're big my boy anywhere says T's little suit the little girl to do it and anyway this is all the shallow stuff but there's deep water that girl didn't get going they have dumbbells in their crotches look at Kyle this is when he was a little bigger still yeah do we have what is the idea so okay so there's deep water like you're 13 feet you have weights ballistic [Music] ballistic training no no punishment to your joints Oh interesting doing cleans in the ocean or in the pool brother yeah I don't this is all shallow there's some deep water stuff and I'm not sure why that guy is doing a little did you drop the Dumbo all the way down to the bottom and so you have drag and stuff like that and also it's lighter in the water and heavier out but this is not this stuff I mean this is all good it increases your lung capacity and things like that but there is a deep water element where so you can be ballistic and you can do all this stuff and you don't pound your joints and you can get stronger so we have a lot of athletes that come and train so that they can sort of work on some of these elements of their being more dynamic or what-have-you you're in compression it's it's pretty cool and we couple it so I know you like to do heat and stuff so we'll do like heat nice and then pool and heat nice and pool and things like that it's it's pretty great and you're tired but you're not beat up George st. Pierre actually did a lot of that and training for his last fight uh-huh did a lot of his work in the pool here's a deeper stuff I say so you can like and what's cool about this too is is that you have to moderate your breath because it's very straightforward air no air air no air hmm and people that are just listening to this we're looking at these guys it's probably like a nine-foot pool they have dumbbells in their hands they drop all the way down to the bottom and then let their knees go to full full Bend and then with their butt to their heels and then jump right back up and pop out of the water get a deep breath and then go right back down again so you're constantly leaping through the water to go to the surface see how the skin ripples so I actually think it's really attractive when you're a girl - I just wanna tell you what is that think about this I actually think so you're in compression so you've got those benefits right and I think your tissue like your fashion everything gets kind of rolled almost in every every set with that ripple I think so and and that they're more shallow and then there's more there's deeper and things like that but there's probably about 35 exercise we've come up with oh wow Laird made us all his crash test dummies but it it well it kind of makes you feel like a million bucks but you can kind of you can bust your butt on it right but you know you're not getting the pounding well that's it I already have a fake knee do you really yeah when'd you blow it up well it was an ongoing since my 20s and then finally at 46 I got it replaced Wow and it is the difference now yeah oh so much better I was right yeah I you still like sleep with my good leg underneath my knee trying to open my knee joint cuz it felt like metal on like hot metal touching and then your foot gets heavy you know you if you lose a lot of your function I tried everything you know like stem cell and PRP and like you try everything cuz you don't want to be like getting a fake knee and then after I was like I'm sure there'll be something better in ten years but right now let's just do it Wow so we went in the same day we actually Laird got his hip done the same day and I got my knee done how did will Laird injure his hip repetitive trauma I mean you know Laird is now 55 he was 52 and he got his hip and he's he's tough on his body I mean you know he's tough on his body and then if you're like doing isometric loading when the foiling that one hips taking a hit it's the back leg it's you know it's a lot a lot of load it's amazing though that he's gotten back to surfing at the same level it's he's he's very unique you know he you know he says that everything he does like his relationships what he reads what he eats what he spends time doing is all to enhance him to perform and his you know a ton of people like this his ability to deal with discomfort he has a very good relationship with discomfort so his training and stuff it's you know he's a lot of those guys wind up injuring themselves because that mental toughness but he's really smart he's not well you're not his age and foolhardy he's not like let me show what I can do he's a guy who can call it he's a guy can go ya know it's not a good idea so when they do the hip they have to put that that rod through the center of the hip then put the new joint on the outside it's all I mean he walked he stayed awake they did a local and he left the hospital three o'clock that day Wow it's carpentry whack outs a choice doctor huge it's not fine surgery it's like carpentry and he stayed awake because the guys like okay you can you can handle it you know the noise or whatever he same time and then he was gone out out of the hospital Wow and how long did it take to rehabilitate not long I mean he was once the incision closed he could go out in the water what's that ten days hips you're pretty cool that's crazy that they can do that now I had a buddy who did that Graham Hancock he did that six weeks later who's here and he told me after we were he was walking around I was saying hi name was that I had my hip replaced so I go when was six weeks ago yeah the fuck are you talking about you just walking you just don't want to play golf you walk out of the hospital okay bad thing well let's say if you were loading your hip that you load into you might want to not do that right away sounds weird but that make sense yeah yeah I could put on weird torque on it yeah I know guys have gotten back to jiu-jitsu with bad hips oh yeah back to rolling and training again it's you know what they basically tell you is you don't want to do anything you wouldn't want to do with your real joint like the guys like so if you ever gone to car accident you wouldn't want your knees to go back and in towards your hip it's like okay well I don't think I'd want that to happen with my natural hip so I think they're pretty good is it significantly weaker no not at all not at all so you can do basically everything he can do everything wow that's crazy and he had a pretty wicked limp the two of us were limping around for like two years it was really cool people like hey you guys are those like athletes right that couple and we're like hobbling around we're like yeah stay right there we'll be right there it was a slight brutal our kids are like what are you gonna do like I'm just gonna run away you know run away I stopped it right there you know what can you do now with your knee can you do all the things you used to be able to do can you really it would be a bummer for jujitsu guys cuz kneeling is kind of not the best like if you said I'll give me a million bucks cash right now Child's Pose that's tough really yeah that's tough what part hurts I think for me it's also part of my biomechanics that the tissue on my my quads is like probably like beef jerky from jumping all those years so that's um I'm always working on so maybe a more flexible person going in would have more mobility in that bench position but it just you know you get a hard finish on it on the joint but I think it's pretty amazing what you can do like it's pretty far out can you side step and stuff yeah I could play volleyball if I wanted to you can jump and land and be hard on it and really do plyos and stuff yeah so they basically say just do stuff that you would do normally with your knee yeah I mean yes be intelligent like you probably wouldn't want to go on an ultra-marathoner now cuz you might wear your joint out in like two years right but I think if you said I really like to run but I'll go on the grass or the sand barefoot probably better stuff like that but that's what you want to do again anyway yeah you know runnings pretty tough on you yeah and it's not just tough on your knees it's tough on your back stuff and everything you want on a hard surface 7 times your body weight right like each step mmm I mean unless you're built like when you see those people that are built to run yeah it's perfect yeah so that was that was sort of I think that's what's interesting about being we need people who almond athlete and and then it's like and some days I don't I'm sure you feel this way it's like I feel so unathletic or so banged up or you know like I have friends that came into training late and everything all their joints are like all perfect and you know they work perfectly and sometimes I I felt a little bit beat up Laird's been beat up a lot but he he kind of trains his way out of it big time now when you guys are on Kauai is there a lot of resources in terms of like places to Train or physical therapists or any of that kind of stuff no I think the other islands like Oahu and Maui they would certainly have it I was I actually this group that owns this business there let me use a warehouse and I taught a class three days a week for free a dollar so they were comforted under my insurance because we have so little training like we have we have acts we have a gym and stuff but like the community on the north then really so I started doing that like three days a week to get people there was like a hundred of us at the same time well it was it was really cool but but because they don't have stuff to they don't have really great facilities what a weird place to live is it it's kind of badass don't you think like when I go to New York City with Laird he looks there and he looks at the buildings and he's like why do people do this to themselves like we've gotten twisted around like you're like kawaii what a weird place to live right but in a way it's probably closer to how we're meant to live oh for sure you know stacked up on top of each other but having said that yeah compared to the other parts of the world I mean in its remote like you're out there it's I think besides Easter Island it's like the most remote place in the world Wow yeah really that's interesting what makes sense yeah yeah it's far I mean you know they navigated there and they said that the water sea level was lower so that they could see more land mm-hmm when the Polynesians sailed there but it's pretty uh it's a pretty interesting contrast to living like in Malibu yeah but then in a way not because you're surrounded by nature right yeah I think it's probably a far more healthy way to live I just I just know that a lot of people do get that Island fever and they can't take it they want to get the fuck off yeah and like if when you have a family like when my kids were young it's like you're doing the same thing you're taking them places you're making dinner as you're making lunches so in a way you're just doing sort of everyday things in a really pretty place mm-hmm and also you probably live a little simpler yeah it's got to be better for you in terms of like the amount of stress that you experience and the beauty of nature is very calming and soothing and probably therapeutic and beneficial yeah but it's that reminder I mean this has been thing for me it's like you could have all that at your access but if you're not if you haven't dealt with yourself or you're hunting if you're feel miserable it sort of doesn't really matter and I think that that kind of place points it out really quick where when you live in a busy place you can distract yourself from yourself and you can be like oh there's traffic and I have stuff to do and I'm busy I'm a busy person I'm at an office I do all the stuff and when you're there you can't blame really the traffic you can you sort of have to go oh that's right so it's an interesting thing of when we talk about like health or or beautiful places and things like that it still always comes back to yourself mmm and like am I have I made myself happy am i doing things that make me feel good things like that so I think what's really great about that place is that gets clear real quick mmm do you guys have real internet out there totally like legit Internet I mean we had dial-up till about 18 months ago for real no but I mean do you have high-speed in there like 5g it or whatever they've got that blanket over us there but is that the mind control 5g net or everybody's worried about that I know latest freaking out about it 5g well we did really something about they do have the ability it does have an effect on human brains that's what I mean it's like pretty pretty good we're gonna do ourselves in one day with innovation we're gonna keep going absolutely until one day we've well fucked ourselves sadly I think that's the way that it goes right like you get so smart that you devolve I checked it when I was a kid we had a Mad Magazine and I'll never forget it I was like 11 years old and there was a sketch of this explosion in space and it was like two aliens talking and they were looking at at this explosion you know millions of miles away and they go oh they said smart beings lived there you know pretty much I mean I think that in a way we're or probably I mean we do a lot with water and air and things like that but it is interesting to see I'm always fascinated that people will do stuff for money like guys like guys running companies and they go well it's okay about the pollution or the byproduct and you go yeah but your kids or your grandkids are gonna like money's not going to protect you from if the climate goes bizarre yeah but they feel like someone else gonna fix that they do I got to get this money you think I'll get that money yeah I think it's just compartmentalization they just don't don't think about the also they're a part of a corporation and everybody just does their little task right but it does trip me out like you know like you know we say the rain falls on everyone's house like it's coming for everything no matter how much cheese you have well it's also the effect that we've had on it has been over this window of a hundred years yeah long and massive effect I mean unbelievably massive effect on the environment it's just a short window of time in terms of you know when you I'm sure you saw it jiro Dreams of Sushi yeah great right yeah one that they're sitting around talking about the fish markets back in the day we'd get so much more tuna like like one day fished out this is one you're alive man so when this guy's in during his lifetime and went from abundance of tuna to being almost fished out yeah and they're not slowing down Sushi's everywhere it's like I know what we've done in 30 years is pretty far out crazy I know it's easy I know it's a it's funny because my kids I don't know if you see this with your kids it's like I think they're pretty aware of it mm-hmm and they I think that they go flip and flop between feeling like the adults are poorly behaved and they're left of the pile of you know of our bad decisions and also like my one daughters like is do you think it'd be okay to be like a militant environmentalist you know she's like six feet tall and I'm like that'd be fantastic she Shepard on steroids like you know you know so I think it's gonna be interesting to see you know with the next group because they're obviously really different like they don't want big giant houses and all that stuff that you know sort of my generation and your generation thought that's how you think the new generation is different in their values and what I do right they say that they they give more they volunteer more I think the tricky thing for them is going to be connection and being able to be connected and being able to have real conversation and you know even be able to concentrate long enough to be with somebody because of devices yeah I mean I think it's far could you imagine right now if you were 20 no and being like dating and swiping and trying to pay attention and or even ten you know my daughter is one of the few girls in her closet doesn't have a cell phone what's the age did they get him like they've had them since they were like seven no I mean you're right kids like what's the rule in your house there's a debate all right now let's figure it out well okay so you have a ten you're going to be 11 yeah I think that they say there's like a movement wait till 8th yeah you heard that yeah like ten kids in the class all the parents agree so they're not the only person in the class that doesn't have it but it's not that way with my daughter's kids the kids in her class most of them iPhones most parents just give the kid a phone yeah it's just there's uh have you read any of Jonathan hates stuff the coddling in the American yeah of course and that that is just so disturbing when you see the amount of especially young girls that are growing up depressed cutting themselves so harm what's that like 400% he said like from 10 to 14 or something crazy like that like something insane massive spike that directly coincides with the invention of smartphones and social media yeah the slot machine yeah it's this this thing where people are just trying to get likes and trying to leverage their you know their social status and and try to pretend that they're living in a perfect world to everybody around them and everyone else is doing it and people look at other people's lives being perfect and they reflect upon their own they get depressed there's just so many factors that kids didn't have to deal with just a decade or so ago it's really off right like at least if I had a hard time at school I could go home and have a reprieve from it at least overnight I think for me that's that's been a thing with my kids is like especially daughters I do think I understand the gaming is different for boys and porn uh pornography and things like that not whole trip of rewiring their brain and but I think with girls it's like how do you get them to understand why don't know how they're going to get to a place where they I mean cuz every it's like this weird mish-mosh of like me too and then never before had people objectified themselves more because they gettin them that positive affirmation like I always say if I put out really smart ideas if I'm a young woman oh I have a thousand followers every shot is of my but I have ten million followers so we have this mixed message going on which is like I'm angry me to treat me equal simultaneously to I'm going to objectify myself in the most hardcore way more than in any time in history when I attack the results and it's really but for me as a female who understands both those sides a little bit I kind of trips me out because I don't think you like those girls you know playing that card and have no violence should be done to you and I agree with all of that no is no and all of that but at a certain point you know like you've had Jordan Peterson on here many times it's like biological signaling it's like what I play a side at least and also that oh that's that one side is super short-lived that's what I try to tell my girls I'm like yo listen if you're you know you're pretty girls it's great but if that's the card you're playing your cards done like by the time you're 30 35 it's done it's over I mean you know unless you're like 40 and you marry a seven-year-old I don't know or whatever giving the MILF porn is that such a thing yeah yeah but even that it's like they got to put a filter on it and like all that stuff I mean come on how do you get these girls to go hey stand up for yourself be strong but like what are you doing but look at all these people that are not doing that that are benefiting I know but it's getting them to understand how do you get a thirteen-year-old to talk about the long game right I mean everything's immediate but for me it's like it's culturally I feel like I'm this weird mix of like the most I came through at the most modern time like women went to school and on scholarships and like we we there was no thought to being like strong not really and then but then weirdly it's like I feel so kind of old and when I see kind of this next thing because I'm like well strong for me was something else strong was like you were really physically strong trying to have a strong mind you know strong basis of a person and then okay then there was this other side like your femininity your sexuality all this other stuff and now it's like I don't know I it's very interesting well there's certainly a bunch of different kinds of people right and there's gonna be people that gravitate towards objectifying themselves that's kind people that gravitate in this day and age towards you know you see a lot of people's pages are just filled with motivational quotes and inspirational things and you know and the stories about people that they meet and photos and you get a lot of people that are attracted to that kind of stuff too it's just you're not gonna get the immediate gratification of a picture of your ass that picture of your ass it gets a hundred thousand likes like wow those likes yeah and then you know it's just a different vibe and you have to decide what are you after you have to quantity or quality or after we trying to accurately Express how you feel and work it out through communicating with people and figure out how they react what you're saying and how you feel about how other people say similar things and how it does good things for you and you want to do good things for them or do you just want to have my but yeah so a piece of dental floss up to crack your ass yes sticking it in front of the camera this you know no and I get that like I get also like I always say when you're a young woman you sort of get this new car and you're like well what happens like what if I put my foot on the gas like you're sort of checking it all out like they respond like this if I do that like that's completely natural but then at a certain point I don't know that the input is like you know like who do you want to be and not based on what everyone thinks about you like what actually turns you on and and makes you feel excited and stoked because you know it's great that you have a nice butt but there's a lot of nice butts and in the end that's not probably gonna bring you that other feeling the problem is that there's a thrill to positive reaction absolutely and that thrill is undeniable I would like it I was too old people and when people get that thrill then you tell them hey that thrills bad for you you look fuck off mom no no I mean a bolt on to that message how about not like get the thrill but simultaneously to doing the thrill maybe have some other thoughts about where you where you'd like to continue to journeys to yeah but you know I think when you tell that to a thirteen-year-old they hear it eventually yeah I think in the beginning like yeah yeah I got this yeah and later when it all goes sideways like god damn wish to listen to mom yeah I think you just got to be it too and have some like cool friends that hang around you because you're if you're the parent it's like okay you're gonna penetrate so much but if you've got some like you know in Hawaii they call them auntie's if you got some badass chicks around you and your daughters are looking they see right they say but what if you don't have access to that I have a lot of pretty strong cool women around me but that not that it concerns me I don't want to say that it's just how do you help the next group you know try to be a good example love on them but get them to teach them to love on themselves right that's all and I don't mean with eyelash extensions and like perfect things I mean like love on yourself yeah you know well that's the other thing too this is a distortion distortion of natural beauty and to you know make it so that everything has to be artificial the color of your lips the color of your eyeshadow fake lashes everything is just that doesn't it doesn't look better it just looks different do you think I I'm always fascinated what men think like do they even like did they does it even register do they know what's going on in what way well I guess we'd have to ask men of that generation if let's say they had two groups of women and one that was like perfectly quaffed with the lip injection quaffed is it yeah I like that I'm talking about like eyelash extensions Joe but like just sort of really done like ready for the club let's just say and then just like a girl like hi I'm you know I'm a sweaty runner and now I'm gonna go to the office and put my hair up in a ponytail I don't know whatever if guys if they even can they tell the difference yeah for sure yeah yeah I mean it's all what you're in what you're into yeah yeah some guys just like I'm soft and made up some guys like I'm sweaty and muscular yeah it's no and I get all that I love that I just mean again it's hardcore signaling and I guess that's maybe that's what it is maybe it's the new biology well it's also that there's never been a time like I got a bit on one of my Netflix specials were about this girl who's got just pictures of her ass yeah like 9 million followers on Instagram like he's never been a person like this before this is a new kind of personally fuck fuck looking at these frogs in the Amazon that no one's gonna say there's a new kind of person yeah this girl just has pictures of her butt and she's got millions of people staring at her all day long and every day is just new pictures of her but it's a great point I always am intrigued how they decide like oh we're gonna do the butt on the beach now let's do the butt next to the puppy it's like I'm so confused how they keep getting ideas I can't even four different things and it's like I know we'll do but with the cotton candy it's like okay I don't know I think it becomes a obsession I mean I think you have to stay fresh with new butt ideas is that like a butt editor envelope editor my audio hey let's close in the head butt editor here but at but calm I don't know but if you have a girl who has let's say some of these girls have millions and millions of followers and they're making millions of dollars they're crushing it yeah maybe they're actually the smartest people in the room and I haven't caught on yet it's certainly an easy path to finances I know right if you have a great ass and you like working out anyway and you just want to take pictures of it also then you have 25 million followers like damn but this goes also okay we do quite a job no definitely not cuz nobody she can say well I'll do the right thing and work at the library I'm not supposed to that it's just I mean if it was my kid I'd be like you know sweetie you might want to weigh out the economics on this right I think you said something really important it's a whole new thing yeah and I think however it's sort of like the communication you're always having which is well what is success mmm and for me it's that's all it's like getting people encouraging them whatever that is whatever that looks like you know you said this like oh you do the show whether anyone was listening or not most likely right probably I mean until you couldn't afford it anymore let's just say but obviously I would do it just to have the conversations I'll do it right maybe I wouldn't do it as much but I would definitely do it right if I had it like if someone said hey you know every few months a physicist will come in here and sit down with you for hours it like yeah let's do it that's what I want to do yeah well you're bringing information to you and learning to you so for you part of your definition that's success yeah and so I guess that is the conversation because we always have this thing that's obvious thing of like success is it either is notoriety its power its money and then we forget those other communications about like the pursuit of something that really genuinely turns you on well I think people get short-sighted and you definitely can get success we just have money and you just have objects you have notoriety and people will view it as success but if you're not doing what you love it's not pure success it's a different kind of success like if you really find something that you enjoy doing and then you take that like Laird has with surfing or many people have with their passions and then you become successful through that it's a different existence because it's an it's a pure existence like when I do stand-up comedy or if I do like commentary for the UFC it's a very it's a pure enthusiasm yeah it's genuine comes across I don't have to fake it it's I enjoy doing it that's to me I don't I know everybody can't do that no everybody feels like they can't do that or they haven't figured out a way to do that yet right but if you can if you can if there's a thing that you can do like maybe I would have made more money if I went into the stock market may be able to made more money if I was a banker maybe I don't know but I definitely wouldn't be as happy there's no way if I'm the same person I am now and I was in a fucking office all day making a hundred times as much money I'd be miserable right and I think that I guess for me that's maybe when I see the thing with the girls and like I said feeling sensitive to it because I have daughters or just young people in general it's that conversation of like you know just keeping that definition of success open and by the way this other path that taking it like following your own instincts or desires or passions there's elements to that that are our heart are harder for sure it's more unknown you can feel insecure like is this the right thing to do I mean we've gone I mean in our house we've gone through that 50 different times you know it's like I'm going to do this because I really want to I don't know what's gonna happen right and I don't know if it's gonna be successful I might even lose money who knows but that once you start to do it or you do it once or twice then you go oh but it's so worth trying if you can pull it off that's the thing that like in everything worth doing is hard to do everything and but by the way you might pursue we've pursued ten businesses and like one is soup really thriving two are doing well and the rest like we ate it we ate it in cash we ate it in time we did so I think that's the other thing that's important is I okay you know it's like sports how many times you know do you lose to you you lose a lot in order to win and I think I think that's something that for me like with my girls it's like they just try to work really hard and hear your own voice and and follow that if you can and it is scary I think it's scary you're also a person who's had that opinion reinforced through vigorous work over the years I mean you're you're you're a super successful competitive athlete which is one of the most difficult things for a person to do to like force your body to perform better than everybody else's figure a way to win figure a way to get points scored figure way we're all these other people we're all so high level athletes are trying to stop you from doing it figure out a way to succeed and you're gonna fucking fail there's no way around it you're gonna have ups and downs but you're going to understand the value of pursuit of dedication and discipline and your kid are gonna see that like they they must know their mom is a badass well I don't know I understand who you are yeah no yes and no I think it's interesting because then you know like how sons can push against dads yeah and of dads identities right sure there's times not my youngest and less my oldest but my middle went through a phase where it was like she was almost like I'm gonna I'm gonna knock her off her high horse no like my records my real estate that I that was my real estate and it's like and you know she's a big strong kid and but then she I think she realized like oh no no no this is more about me finding my own real estate like my mom did that because that was what my mom had to do and what she what was good at and that was my thing and it was but there was a minute that I think listen no kid looks at their parent that they actually live with by the way and is like yeah they're cool there's just no I mean like it might desert did that man called like four times a year they'd be like it's my mom she's on the phone right she's an exotic country they're like you know get me some water I'm going to bed like you know it's like it's no different in any house and by the way I I have this new thing I'm doing right now with my youngest daughter because she can get me like she can get me like nobody's business like Laird oh he's jokes he goes you two are not allowed to drive in the car together anymore like we come home from one ride from school and I'm on the mats alright this kid is like cuz we're very similar and she just worked me and then she work you was just you and her alone she's no dummy this kid is so smart we always joke I like Brody gonna run something I just want her to have friends hopefully you know that she's she's pretty radical and she always gives you this look to while she's carving you up that's like a slight smirk on her so and then you think I'm I'm you know I'm I've been around I'm trying to be evolved and I don't think I'm having a you know insulin spike like I should be balanced in calm I think I meditated this morning and I'm like four seconds and I'm like like no push your buns and it becomes a little sport for him yeah so now okay so this is the best so I go okay I Laird was telling me the story years ago he got he went down a river raft went down a river and went down the rapid and got pinned against a rock okay and it was breaking on his back and he said he was pushing on the rock and pushing couldn't get off okay and he said he had this image of like a skeleton like on the rock you know like with the water just pounding on it you know it's like the clothes all messed up and he said he he moved his foot it wiggled his foot and his whole body slipped out oh wow and so I said with when I see my youngest daughter I'm gonna wiggle my foot because I keep pushing and prodding and she's just coming you know she's a hydraulic like it's not stopping it's nonsizi like she's younger than me she has more energy she's faster I mean you know and so I go I'm just gonna wiggle my foot like literally to the point where even if I need the physical cue like if she stand there doing some of her weird bullshit I'll just be like what move my foot just to give him a trigger like I've got a tree my parent I'm like against the ropes like everybody else and so and I have a partner who supports me and sometimes he looks at me like who no that's not that strong of a game gap and so so you know we'll we'll get into it and I and also I'll go to pick her up and my whole thing is one nice I talked to my kids in the morning like first thing I always say hey good morning like I try really hard to be the adult and to be the parent right like that's what I really want to do like I really want to show up as the adult and flawed be it I still be like you know I at least she's acting like an adult that that woman over there you know get me water and so uh she'll get in the car and I'll be like hi honey how was your day at school you know I try even the hook of the fake nice tone and everything yeah I don't really you know listen I spent almost seven hours there I really don't want to talk about school took a colossal waste of time hold that she 11 she's like and then she said to me yesterday I'm not exaggerating she goes you know and if you listen no offense I'm sorry mama dude I just if you can't tell I don't like to talk that much it seems like a waste of time she's very self-contained I'm thinking through that but okay so then I'm like all right what another strategy so I go oh that's cool like I can be self-contained like I'm cool I don't need you I go sweetie I don't care no problem I just click over a little bit into my mail like okay I've this car and maybe I'm gonna drive a little faster and like let's go and within three minutes somehow all the things I said I wasn't gonna get lured into nothing I'm gonna wiggle my foot all this like philosophical stuff I've been reading books she gets me and she's like 95 pounds she's my only kid that gets me like this and it's literally like if you went into a restaurant and you said okay I'm not gonna order the lasagna and the hamburger and the double fries with the chilli sauce and you walk in and you go I'll take the little sign near the hamburger and then it's like the one thing I said I wasn't gonna do and she gets me every time so that's something I'm always really trying to figure out and also like sir back away from I this lady actually you should have her on your show have you ever heard of Byron Katie no you got to get her Jaime you got to get her she taught me a lot of stuff but it's basically like full and men do this better generally and yes there are women that do it as well as men I'm not getting into all that but it's like surrendering mmm like maybe my kids gonna grow up and they're gonna be completely different than what I thought or what they would be or my expectations and that's actually probably closer to the real the real thing so I can be that you know going through sports I was like man volleyball is way easier than this it is it's just very it's cuz it straightforward right take the ball hit the line yeah take take the ball and hit the other line oh okay no that was did you complete that no I didn't hit the line okay hit the line is your eleven-year-old involved in sports oh yeah the worst sport ever what sport horses like beauty pageants on big animals worse parents don't think it's cute to take six year olds and think oh it's so sweet we'll get them we'll go ride horses because then they fall in love with horses and then they want better horses and then they want pretty horse pants and then the boots and my buddy's daughters deep in the horse Killians game she I have to say to her I'm sorry you were not born to millionaires I'm really so sorry for you it's pretty heavy my middle daughter is into tennis and she's pursuing tennis and I'm trying to figure out how to manipulate my young one out of away from horses and she'll say to me I know you think it's a phase and it's not oh just gonna make it an odd phase and she's and that's why I'm like no do whatever you want but you have to use your own the body at least a couple days a week I go because you're using the body of the horse and by the way doesn't it frustrate you I even tried this I can't believe I'm admitting this I mean I thought you guys loved the animals you know like you really loved horses and what you're doing to them is not good for the horses whoa they land on the same foot and she's like they jump in nature I go they don't not with a hundred pounds on their back they don't and not they don't land on the same leg I've tried that I can't do that anymore that's not fair I totally and then the other thing I've tried is doesn't it irritate you if you are on a horse and you were more talented as an athlete or you had trained harder but your horse wasn't as good so you couldn't win done and she just looks at me like I'm gonna ride this out she doesn't care it's nothing that's her because that's what frustrates me imagine if it was like I had a better guy than you so I could kick your ass and you know jujitsu because Mikey was more expensive mmm you'd be like wait a second I trained twice as hard as you I've been doing it longer and maybe I'm just better than you nope Mikey's more expensive so if you have a shitty horse there's nothing you could do about it and the judges know they know they know so yeah I would never get into that and I don't come from that I barely come from like if I didn't hit a white ball I wasn't even going to university never mind like you know this whole horse world things horsehide I thought myself I went to a show once and I was like saying good morning to all the groomsmen like good morning sir good afternoon and like giving stink-eye to all the ladies you know I was like yeah this is an upside down Worsley these are a different thing yeah I just I I really this is one of my I lose sleep over this show really yeah I do I do mm-hmm mm-hmm it's a lot of money it that's not the part I mean I lose sleep over that too because I'm like Claire's gonna kill me but but cuz then the flip side of it is I got a kid who's into something she'll go to the barn if you let her seven eight hours she'll work with the horses lunge them do all this stuff so then you're like okay well she's into something this is not a kid who will sit around and not do anything but I just I guess for me it's the you know it's it's the it's a money sport you know yeah that weird bubble wheely thing yeah you know so that that part was like I was like oh god how did we get here yeah yeah that's what my friend is dealing with with his daughter how old is his daughter she's ten Oh is he in deep already yeah did is he Lisa work yeah yeah got a horse they have they brought a horse at least oh okay yeah yeah yeah yes I didn't know you could and there's horse brokers there's a whole thing of times it's a shyster a whole trip it's super expensive to lease a horse too right I think it's like 40 grand a month or something crazy no that's like well then you've got a really fancy horse but it's expensive and I made that number up yeah you did and then that's like Bill Gates daughters or something but then it's like I don't know for me that's a but again as a parent I had these are one more of my lessons like hmm I'm not her and she's not me right I have AI as much as I used to think I was so in charge of so many things you know I think being in a long relationship I've been with Laird almost 24 years it's like you start to learn like oh okay I'm I'm not I can impact you I can influence you I can support you I can love you I could try to inspire you but I'm not here to it's like even as a parent like I'm not here to control anyone and that's a hard thing because when you get a little baby you control you're in charge that's what you need to be and then all of a sudden it's like oh yeah no that shift is they don't I wish people need to talk more about like the shift of because we're not objective and you know the tools that you need you got to keep adding tools and it's it's very humbling do you find it easier to do on Kauai or at in California is it any different well it depends right so if I meet my middle daughter who's a teenager not on Kauai she looks 18 or 19 and you know there's not a lot to do and so that's tricky there here like she she basically lives at a tennis house and she goes she's homeschool and she does five to seven hours of tennis her choice as of in the last couple of months so it's easier because there's just more productive things to do hmm what I like is when they're little Kauai is great because it's so simple the life is simple so what kids are thinking about is like playing and being in nature and like developing also a toughness to them that maybe like city kids have it different you know cuz like they're barefoot and they're like climbing trees and they're throwing rocks at each other and it's just like a little more rough and tumble so when they're little kawaii certainly easier and then as they get older that's what we're we're we're serve at now it's like you got to adapt and put these kids give them a launching pad if you will because the problem is like I went through this growing up in an island it's like you don't know all that's out there to dream to do and it's even if it's you know everything in life it's so true about like being like the alchemists like I even see it with Laird it's like he went out into the world he's done all this stuff and there's certain things we're doing in projects right back onto kawaii and and so there's always going to be that element probably of I went and I I did all these things i express myself all these ways and then there's some basic parts about where I exactly started that are still really to me but I think it's important for kids to see like it doesn't matter where you're from or how you grew up like certainly learned I both the same way it's like you you really could try to do anything and and pursue that if it's in you if it's genuinely in you and calling you and I want that for my kids and I don't care what that is but just they have something that they get up each day and they're like yo I'm turned on yeah that really is what people need they really need something they love doing that's it and I think that's when I was talking about success is sometimes we have all this you know kind of bells and whistles and attention around getting attention and I think people don't realize that getting attention I mean you know this for yourself it's like yeah it's great but what is it like what is it really and when you close the doors and you're hanging with your people that are your close to its like you know what's making you excited for real and who loves you for real in that way of like it's great if people appreciate your work that always feels good but if you're doing it for your real reasons then I already think that is a real success and we spend a lot of time working so why not have something that we're fired up on and that's the thing because it's like you know you spent a long time of your life working what do you want to do yeah then guiding a child into that direction of trying to set them up in a way that they view their life as kind of a project and the most enjoyment you're gonna get is find a thing that excites you the find the thing that you really get inspired by some that whatever the fuck it is it's gonna be different for you than it is for me you got to find out what that thing is but it's all the same thing once you find out what that thing is that that thing genuinely gels with your personality and your likes and your passion just run with it you can do it yeah you can run with it and it changes too I think that's the other thing is also we get to find like okay you were doing this one job and then it's like okay but that job is over like it's like being an athlete or a you know you know competing competitive athlete on an organized platform that a day at a time and then when that's over do you want to look back and keep talking about that or do you want to look and see who you are now and who you'd like to be and I think that that's always a you know kind of an important thing to teach people especially people that have well I'm I'm a comedian I was a professional athlete it's like okay that's cool I had some guy coming to me once and say hey um I was at the golf course and I was one of my kids were hitting golf balls and he goes weren't you that volleyball player Gabby and I was like well no I'm I'm still Gabby but one of the things I've done is play volleyball and I think that that actually if we can get to that that's even better it's like Who am I and then off of this non you know as far as like it whether you're older or younger or in one part of your career or not it's like you still can always be the essence of yourself and then it's like oh and now right now I'm doing this and then and I was you know but I'm not I'm not for all time just a you know a ballplayer fighters have a huge problem with that their identifies being fighters so much that once they retire they almost almost all of them except for a small percentage almost all of them come back because they just they miss it so much they miss the excitement in the thrill and they don't know who they are without that pursuit the pursuit is the next fight the pursuit is training camp getting ready and when they don't have that for a long time it just starts really chipping away at them well I think to the amount of focus it takes to be really good at that kind of stuff or to run a company or anything it it makes sense why it's so hard to try to diversify while you're doing then it is really hard but I think it's important to quietly keep that voice inside your head going yeah but who are you run beyond that expression of yourself who are you what do you how do you feel about things and also the opportunity like to kind of grow up mmm you know there's so many opportunities like 30 40 50 like to try to and I don't mean grow up in the notion of like you're so responsible now I mean like grow up in a way that like maybe you you change your ideas and the way you do things and you know I was I was talking Laird I was in this situation this week where I something had gone down I didn't like the way it had gone down it wasn't to do with him and I was like you know what I'm I'm not gonna attach to this like I I know better so now I'm just gonna notice that it kind of bugs me and I'm not gonna attach all the way to that feeling into that experience and for me that's more what I mean about growing up not like being you know grown up because I actually think the more growing up we are also means we could probably be more childlike - mm-hmm for sure both so it isn't about like be responsible it's just a different freedom so I mean I would think in the end that that would be a more interesting quest than I was a champion anything right I don't know and it's not sexy and it's internal but I don't know it's can be I think pretty rich well I think ultimately for a person who's experienced athletic highs and the highs of accomplishments but also understands real personal struggle that's when like a person like you you've experienced so many different things that you can you and understand what's actually beneficial towards you right and it's pretty simple I hate to that's kind of the heavy part it's like it's like being married to Laird like Laird is wants to go to bed at 8:30 and Laird wants to get up early and he keeps it pretty simple and I it's an interesting thing because within it there's um he seems pretty good I mean as long as there's sometimes waves that guy is like that seems like a that's pretty straightforward well that's it right like how do i how do I get the highest ideas the biggest ideas you know whether it's like dealing with ego or whatever get the biggest ideas and then get everything else pretty stripped down pretty simple yeah because otherwise it just I feel like you're running around and I'm I like I love the day so I'm running around I'm like what am i reacting to like what like what is going on like I'm like a crazy person right and then it's like okay you know you gotta back it up in it and listen with kids it's hard because you're only as good as like your whatever your kids are going through I mean and then there's elements of it like they're going through things and you go it's probably pretty natural you know even if it's super hard it's like and that's okay too and you don't want that for them but I think you know that's something I've really learned is like I did god it's a memory that you have to go through that and it's hard to watch and I don't want you to and that's okay too because that's part of it's really cool though to see them come out on the other end and then talk to you about it oh it's not bothering me so much more Omar yeah I get it yeah I was just upset but I'm alright you know it was really cool thing I learned because I am you know listen I'm I'm pretty not Siri I die I'm a pretty serious person like Laird is sort of the lighter person of the two of us and I someone sort of gave me some information about like not resisting with my kids like my oldest was going through something and I said I just need to tell you how I feel about this but I didn't make it a big deal I just sort of dropped it off and said hey this I'm feeling and she said to me very clearly and she was like 22 this just feels like something I have to do and I remember thinking I felt like that and nobody understood what I was doing and I understood I had to something I had to do for my reasons and I was right for myself and what I did is I just went okay I get it and where I wanted her to end up happened so much quicker because I didn't put up the resistance and that's the other thing I mean how long does it take me to learn that one it's like you know not having to try to resist or navigate every single situation and just go okay and and then you get through it so much faster and they get through it no I know you're like super in nutrition and yeah Laird has this you guys have this company super food yeah do you force that stuff on your kids are you kidding my kids if they want to eat pasta and whatever they can eat whatever they whatever they want yeah because I cook dinner so we know what dinner looks like my kids I always say just know what's the difference between food and fun like be clear bagel is a lot of fun right not food right because I just want to send them into the world equipped with the information on how they can take care of themselves right because if you make anything a thing don't have that when they go to their friend's house they'll have a bag of chips the clicker and they'll be like I love it here yeah so I am like I eat whatever you want and my kids eat pretty healthy that's awesome that they listen that way they don't listen well that they figured it out that they eat healthy you're smart well also okay so my middle for a minute like never met a carb she didn't like right and it was like it was bad for a minute she was like 12 13 whatever and then she and she knows the difference and she was also using food to set you know kind of sways some feelings and other stuff too that's real interesting thing but then she's come around it but it's not let's not pretend that my kids listen they don't they must a little no they don't no doubt your example that's more it they're watching but they don't listen you think in a way learned I could be sort of may be imposing parents in some way and I'm telling you they are not they don't it doesn't there's they look at us like what do you got it's like come on it's your move so I've just learned like it's your choice like this is what I'm serving for dinner I don't have pop in the house obviously but if like we want some place you know I showed him a picture when they were little remember the guy who did like Eat This Not That Dave with the Z from men's health the editor anyway it was like seven or eight chocolate chip cookies and a Sunkist soda opposite each other and I'm like do you want to cookies or do you want that soda and they got it it's like okay cuz it showed how much sugar was in both so it's just that kind of stuff but they don't it's not like we live so healthy and they listen you know I mean like Greenfield right he lives in like the forest and they that's different it's a different level of control I don't have that kind of control yeah Ben's got a weird thing going on out there his kids listen do they they must they're out in the forest they have to that's what I mean I'm saying I don't have that level of containment brah that that's how he has to deal with predators like living predators yeah you can't really let your kids just go loose in your backyard no I know keep an eye on them it's easier than coca-cola and Cheetos though in a different kind of way I'm just saying like predators very straightforward like it's a predator don't go out there it's like well you know this food it's in a bag it's got you know it's not that good for you your cell functions like okay what my friends do it it's like you know predator so I just think I don't know I just think I think I've surrendered to the idea of them listening and I just try to show them the best example and they are intelligent people that I have faith in will arrive at their own conclusion and by the way you know they make other choices I don't think so though how many kids leave Kauai like when they grow up not many I don't think I think it's it's tough because it is so beautiful and magical and on some level intuitively it makes so much sense there you know what I mean like it makes a lot of sense right like the food's growing there's certain things that and you go into the real world you're like whoa do they have good supermarkets er yeah it's just everything costs of a box of cereals like $9 well no for real so it's hard but some kids leave I would think that that would be a difficult transition between going from Kauai it's like moving to Chicago or something like that it can be especially if it's like December but I think you'd be Supriya let me tell you the cold is shocking when you come from an island like Larry goes snowboarding I'm like Alaska and stuff like that cuz he loves all that right but I grew up in st. Thomas and I'm just like you know five days in the cold I'm like this is so beautiful and then I'm like I'm good you know but I think you know listen Island people they either like Jones for the big city or the numb tourist destination for Hawaiians you know what it is what Vegas well cuz its opposite right it's like it's like everything's artificial and then you have a lot of like Filipino Japanese Chinese Hawaiians so like find gambling things like that oh yeah it's a number one like Hawaiian Airlines that's their number one destination for locals they go to Vegas Wow yeah I mean cuz it's the antithesis right yeah I guess you see the strip and all the neon the craziness totally giant flashing this and that a drop of water not anything natural like you're not really supposed to be there you know like there's no Garden of Eden that makes sense Oh totally either they they go like hey I want to be a designer in live in New York or you know that's got to be the ultimate 180 culture shock they have that though for sure yeah yeah for sure they have that mm-hmm I think I I'm with Laird though about living there whenever I go there I'm like what in the fuck is this I love it I Love New York for like a week well you can get stuff done in New York and to a real New Yorker there's no other place like New York right like I can get whatever food I want exactly how I want it yeah there's that and I can get stuff done and you also breathe in break dust all day yeah it's tough and I don't think we're supposed to be living on stacked on top of each other that's the thing and there's always like yeah something goes wrong this is the worst place you ever want to be like garbage water toilets he's like he's always thinking about like if they turn the power off it's gonna happen yeah me too yeah so that's how he kind of how he lives I mean we had a hundred year reign in Kauai and April bows a large five feet in a day yeah it was pretty radical so and then then we went through the fires so it's just like I think there's a fires and it rains that much well knowing map then we were here in Malibu and so we had that like within six months after so I think he's always and I think you know some when people do things in nature like rock climbers or big wave surfers or whatever they're more in tune with the fact that like stuff does go wrong and so they're not assuming that it's always going to be as it always is so as you get hit with big storms out there we're qui like hurricanes yeah they haven't had really a significant one since Aniki which I believe was in 92 which was really bad I think it was the Lark the fastest wind speed to hit land however far away you guys as the crow flies from like the Big Island he's got it do you see he's got a thing for the Big Island what's happened to you on the Big Island I love it there did you have like an experience or no do you go no no just there anything I like it there because it's it's it's it's like a good medium like yep I get it not quite as populated as Maui it's not as metropolitan no but it's still pretty big whereas lanai is probably my favorite really yeah it's just interesting it's so quiet and yeah I hunt there for like a day oh there we go and make sense it's also overpopulated so it's like the most it's like the best ethical argument for hunting yeah I'm currently available in the United States of America if you want to call Hawaii the United States of America I know if you ask a Hawaiian like oh you're American they're like you know Hawaiian the other Hawaii yeah they're home Hawaii is the most North so it's the other end of the chain so how far away would it be so if you're gonna fly in an airplane it's an hour or 45 minutes because of takeoff and landing if it was like straight like we whip we go in a plane it's probably 28 minutes so how many miles is that cuz you're going 500 miles an hour it's a couple hundred miles yeah it is Wow yeah no yeah yeah yeah no I mean it's an amazing person you I'm informing right now what ya rageous I like your fascination with Hawaii yeah I love it out there I really do yeah that's great Steven Tahoe try to talk me into moving to Maui mm-hmm yeah he loves it out there really he loves it loves it yeah he gets off though yeah I mean he flies around does his Aerosmith's shows and does that television show and all that jazz but he loves Maui yeah you don't love it too much I do love Maui I guess I live there also when it was like a little less populated so it's like anything when you watch it you just kind of go whoa what it's a it's a great blend for me yeah it has still nothing compared to this like I was just that's right I mean it's like this is that's right well we're here is crazy at least what do we have like 35 million people something preposterous it even no really they just guess what are you like the ninth largest economy in the world yeah I told on earth when we had this whole thing with all them the Mexican you know the Mexican you know whatever non illegal whatever I said I have a friend of mine who he's from here but he's from Mexico and I said you should ban together you have the ninth largest economy in the world and get together and have demands because you're helping run the ninth largest economy in the world well that's what's hilarious about people that want the immigrants to go back to Mexico listen stupid this thing would fall apart that's a global ice oh he's crazy about it is like they're already a part of the system like why don't they get the benefits I think he was laughing because when I went to see him I go how's it going to goes well hopefully I'm here tomorrow joking you know and I go you guys had like you're making it happen yeah hard though to get people to organize like that they're so worried about being shipped out and now ice you know I had a friend of mine who's a veteran and he's an older gentleman he's in his 50s he got pulled over at ice how come on at the Home Depot they asked him where he's born and he said hey asshole you're not supposed to ask questions like that like you don't have a warrant to do and he started grilling the guys and he pulled out his military ID he's like what the fuck are you guys doing here what do you think you're doing yeah yeah I'm American I was born in America yeah because I'm an American citizen I'm also a veteran and then he started goes like you guys this is illegal you're not supposed to talk to people like this but they can do that to people that don't know and are scared right I mean yeah but you if you're just an American citizen at fucking Home Depot you're not supposed to get harassed by some guy who thinks you might be Mexican cuz you're brown yeah some brown skin yeah it's fucking crazy but it's just also like is this really where our problems are what about these using these resources in a positive way wow there's a lot of shit that needs to get done but that's ever I mean that's every where think about how much time gets spent on not doing anything yeah and going the other direction I don't well there isn't that less of a problem though when you have a small community like Y that's got to be like a huge alleviation of frustration this is just the giant masses of people and the stupid jobs everywhere it's like you guys you guys kind of kind of boiled down to a much more natural state well it's all very accountable right like if I say something to you I don't get to walk away from that right you're on a fucking little island I'm gonna see if 50 more times that day and so I gotta own it if I you know and that that was all Laird's biggest adjustment is cuz everything he you know doesn't says he is owns it and so he when he first came here and like even driving if someone flicked him off like you just don't do that in Hawaii right I know your truck like I know you I know your sister like I'm gonna come into your house what are you talking about yeah and I've been with him where he has pulled people over and said listen like you you can't go and just like drop off aggressive gestures you just don't know who like what's up with people like you've got to be accountable like this like you know and I'm like okay but you cannot stop every vehicle like jump out and be like hey right right right but that he or is he do that there no he's done it here no you don't have to do it there right there do it here it's dangerous yeah I guess can be it can be it's true it can be I don't know and he's but again he's he's older and wiser no I'm talking about like maybe morning first they're together in his early thirties crazy Laird but he still has a look at his eye where it's like I don't know yeah I get it like well if you're really used to that environment to where everybody is accountable and then you see these just assholes yeah beeping and also if you really said okay let's go outside de Becque I'm gonna get a lawyer right I think for him that's the weird twisty part it's like in Hawaii if they say it it's like okay let's go at least it's like okay I'm gonna stand up to own the words I say and everything here it's like if you go okay and they go you know I'm gonna call somebody like he's like okay well which is it you know like I always tell my kid that my one daughter does that she'll be like really aggressive and then you call her on it she gets like she's the victim I go no no you have to pick like which one are you are you like aggressive or you the victim I don't know I I think it's interesting he he will call people out every time know if they are acting weird he'll just say like what's up or how's your date and I'm like oh people are not accustomed to right cuz in Hawaii they're just very respectful that way and well there's accountability and I think that's important yeah there's also a lot of fighters coming out of Hawaii well it's a fighting a warrior culture so you know like uncle slapped boys heads and like and it's also now because of the Brazilian influence coming in now you've got you know jiu-jitsu and and also I think about this they're pretty strong right and and so contact they don't mind a little contact like they even joke about like Polynesian rugby players like it's like all fun like oh haha you know like we're leveling each other right so you're also talking by people who maybe they don't mind a little little contact yeah you know like playful because they are also playful mm-hmm so it's also like this weird thing of like I'm not I don't take myself so serious so there's like a playfulness but also like oh we're gonna do you notice a big difference between like female athletes and male athletes like okay cuz fighting is a pretty I don't want to say exaggerated but it's an interesting thing where you know you have men and women kind of differently but doing the same thing if you will yeah um do you notice a difference in their mentality well they vary so much individually that's what's interesting it's like you'll find even male fighters or like super laid back and then you find other ones that are really intense it's super emotional and it's really hard to tell like there's a there's Gunnar Nelson it's a guy from Iceland you know is I know yeah fantastic jujitsu guy you cannot get that guy to change his expression it doesn't change you could punch him kick him in the balls he stays stoic it's a weird he's a weird guy yeah he's very on one side of it and then there's like guys like Conor McGregor who's also his training partner who's on a completely different side of it he's screaming and yelling and talking shit to everybody and you know that's that's part of his flair you know they vary so widely and it's that's true with girls too some girls are brash and outrageous and they get in other girls faces and put their knuckles on their nose and they're at the staredown and other girls bow and they hug and they take selfies together it's like everyone has their own sort of approach to it yeah it's very interesting it is interesting I'm always I'm I'm in fighting and intrigues me and that I think it's interesting that you're trying to be offensive and defensive at the same time dealing with fear like all these things happening simultaneously and I then take it I look at it one step further with a female because I don't know I I'm interested to know how if a female can fight from a not not a non-emotional place but without her emotion mm-hmm like just like okay I'm in my male I mean my athlete and I'm not gonna be like oh she didn't just kick me in the ear you know I'm like freaked out you know what I mean you know like I've only been in one fight my whole life and the girl hit me in the face and when I saw my blood I was like oh no she did not just hit me in the face you know and then went crazy but if these girls could be like because they're so well trained as an athlete how that can Otsuka seed like or override actually like this in that feminine impulse of like you know reaction a reaction that's a masculine impulse to though I think it's a human impulse if a guy punches you in the face you get furious it's so hard for people to not get emotional when they get hit yeah because you want to get it back that's a good point it's a very bad way to react in a fight to fight with emotions because you expose yourself right you leave yourself open for counters you just you miss your rhythm you're not as deceptive and your emotions you're too obvious in your pattern and so many times you you get hit a lot more it's a it's a big problem with fighters that emotion is a very big problem and the wanting to break people like letting them hit you so you could show them that they can't hurt you rescuing thing too stupid it's very stupid take it on the face on purpose and then just like come on come on come on hit that's what you have yeah then that's a terrible emotion though you can get completely knocked unconscious doing that happens all the time it's just the smart thing to do is to fight with correct technique and with a correct strategy meaning you have an understanding of how to execute best it's not to just wade in and let bombs fly it's you have to you have to be very precise in your tactics you gotta be very smart I think it's interesting though those sports where there is that I mean listen versions of it is football you know living with Laird obviously you know he always says he appreciates mother nature because it's like you make good decisions you're rewarded you make bad decisions you you pay a price but I think it is very interesting when you have two humans strategically trying to deconstruct one another hmm the chess the physical chess that goes on as like looking at it from another athlete point of view I think it's a unique person that wants to put themselves in that situation yeah you know it's like I understand almost like you know a surfer and a wave and a rock climber in a mountain I get that like I'm gonna be a part of that but I find it really interesting and even sort of I'm even more curious about women like who say like yeah this is gonna be my sport they vary so wildly like there's Holly Holm who's she just seems like awfully sweet she's so she's like she'd bring you cupcakes come out so murder you just kick your fucking I mean listen I saw that kick but then it's like I'm so sorry I made you these after you know cookies it's like okay I'll get it you know when I get from the hospital I don't know it's it is interesting when you see girls like that yeah well they're all different I always want to know do they have brothers mmm like where they rabble-rousing and that their whole time and it wasn't and they learned to play and it wasn't personal you know and like a little contact was okay maybe I mean in Ronda Rousey's case it was also it was very much yeah her mom was a world you to a champion mom's a beast she's had an interesting path I think yeah yeah I'm wonder how much she loves at WWE I wonder I always wonder when a person is like an elite athlete at the highest level everyone a real one if they they still enjoy doing that because I think she enjoyed it though I think she was a fan of it before she liked the theater of it yes I think she actually enjoyed pro wrestling you know and they are doing athletic things even though it's scripted mm-hmm obviously flying off of an into and around I mean it's athletic but it's scripted yes it's not competition but then again you could only get knocked unconscious so many times you can only get fucked up so many times and she got fucked up two fights in a row and really bad the Holly Holm Kos is ruthless that was brutal and then Amanda Nunez just punched her face in for 48 seconds it was horrific yeah that was hard to watch I don't like to watch I mean I don't like to watch really big guys punch each other and women I don't know why I like when guys are a little smaller it's easier to watch as long as they're not kicking themselves in the head I'm just saying so the big scary ones like heavyweights yeah you just go oh my god I just that guy took eight years off that guy's you know yeah it's definitely different you do notice it like there's certain heavyweights and they hit guys and they get knocked unconscious whether it's Francis and Ghana or steep a Miocic or these big guys and they slam someone's like oh my god that's what I mean like I watch that I don't actually I mean violence I know it's sport but for me it's oh it's violent it is yeah it's a it is a very dangerous path that you have to know when to get off and more I don't know if I would say more so than other combat sports but yeah it makes all of them Oliver have a path but I think very specifically MMA has you have to be really careful because the consequences are so great there's not enough padding in those gloves or tiny little things you could also get kicked you can get need in the face elbowed in the face and once you realize the chin starts going and your reflexes start going and you're slowing down like you got to get out and you know you got to get out yeah and sometimes they don't get the proper advice you know and sometimes they don't know what else to do they don't have anywhere else to go and that goes back to yeah I was talking I talked to Larry about that because we have tons of friends and organized sports so if like you have to be drafted or coach the team has to pick you up or you know whatever and I say to him like how fortunate are you that you're in a sport like other athletes like a snowboarder or whatever that you can go yeah you can go out yeah you want a ride you can go right nobody's dictating to you right and if you're really smart you're managing yourself and your health and your well-being in your melon and everything else you could write a really long time yeah that's a big difference between down in a competitive fighter 55 years of age you match it yeah getting hit over and over no chance I mean you could still train in certain aspects especially jiu-jitsu a lot of people deep in their 60s 70s 80s trained you can definitely do that but there's such a such a difference you know Laird can go out there and do what he wants to do at the same level he was able to do two decades ago I know it's it's exhausting actually swear to God because I feel like clared is like I in this way of like when you live with somebody that's sort of you know it's like I mean you know you have a partner it's like in ways they're a reference to you mm-hmm in certain ways yeah and so I like living with him and you're referencing him as an athlete you're just like oh man I gotta yeah I gotta get busy I gotta get training I gotta get moving well it's just like cuz he's he's non-stop that guy cuz he has to that's a different type right you know I a lot of times I'll train cuz I'm like hey I know how good I feel when I'm done and it's important and I have other stuff I need to do but I'm gonna get it in and for a guy like that it's just like what it would be like if I took an 80 pound dumbbell and saw at the bottom of the pool for a minute and then tried to do 15 you know it's just like he also has a creative approach I'm more linear and it's like for time and for this and he's like let's just go until we can anymore it's like okay when's that drill gonna end do you train with them only in the pool I'm telling you you got to come with a friend and someone that you feel safe with and I'm gonna be honest with you we have fighters and trainers have the hardest time in the pool really yes and I'll tell you why a lot of them are built they have a lot of mass ok like it's so number one right there just the mass like you're more dense you go to the bottom yeah ok the other side of it is they're used to doing everything quickly hmm and the water is like awesome that you want to do it quick this is how we're gonna do it right and so it's a pretty cool environment but we've had a lot of we've had fighters and trainers and they're built for but once you know obviously once they get the hang of it but I think it's it's pretty special the training because you when you're done again it goes back to I am like a noodle you're exhausted and your joints are not just hammered this is called xpt so yeah not xpt it's like it's part of it online that you can follow yeah I mean but the pull training though it's like you have to kind of do it with somebody someone else to show you yeah I mean we started originally it was like we'd wear weight vests and lards like just go try as long as you can and it's like ok I think I'm I'm good now like I I cannot swim anymore you know I can't tread it anymore and then it was actually one of my daughter she might have been like 6 or 7 at the time maybe younger and she would swim to the surface with a dumbbell and there's like oh what if we made we had reps and you do sequencing where you're on an exhale or on an inhale or whatever he'll go from like a you know I verse a climber or a bike and have your heart rate way up and then go okay now you're gonna do the set so it's like there's all these ways to adapt and it's pretty cool I think for people who train that's the whole thing is how do you keep modifying like do you get locked in like on your training or do you keep going okay I've heard you talk about like oh I've added yoga and all these things like that's the other thing is like you get pretty good at something but no how do you keep kind of adding you know doing things that you're sort of unsure you're uncomfortable you're not good at I think that that's always been easier for layer than me I've always sort of gone like well no I'm good over here like I do this good it's like okay change it up you know so I think that's been a I think that's the thing so that's that has everything that has we do a lot of breathing heat nice because his other thing is like active recovery mm-hmm people go I'm having day off it's like okay so what are you gonna do to actively recover not just take the day off so I think he's you know been really into that but so active recovery meaning you do somebody or something mellow so that you can participate in helping the body actually recover not just sit around right how much fit is that and like doing something physical as opposed to just sitting around doing nothing I think it's I think it makes a huge difference because I don't think it's about I have to tax my my adrenals or my nervous system or any of that I think it's okay I'm gonna take a very you know a yin yoga class so the poses are long it won't be like necessarily a high-flow class or I'm gonna do multiple series of heat nice like some days he'll go and just do three rounds in the sauna and three rounds on the ice or I'm gonna do 35 or 45 minutes of breathing you know recovery breathing things like that to really oxygenate the tissue in the cells and things like that so I think it's just kind of looking at what a day-off looks like and making that something that you participate in in in supporting the recovery not just I laid around now having said that there are days where after you done with that yeah great lay around like go to sleep early eat extra more calories whatever you need to do but I think active recovery even riding a bike you know flushing the system to issue things like that I think people think you know off means like nothing and I think doing something or for certain athletes like maybe get a massage that day that might be the best thing you know so I think for him it's feeling it out do you guys use any electronics like in terms of apps or heartrate monitors or anything along those lines not too too much I used to use a Fitbit Laird uses a box oximeter oximeter oximeter to like if he does breathing to see if he can get as self up to altitude so he'll use that to measure and things like that but I think once you do something a really really long time you sort of go am I on the edge or rni he'll use electronics more for speed and distance he'll put it on his boards and be like okay we went X miles and the peak speed was whatever 50 miles an hour so he'll use it more for that to measure distance on how many miles he rode each day on the water but not necessarily micromanaging electronically all the metrics now having said that if you were an athlete where you know little seconds here and there made a difference maybe you would write or you know checking your heart rate and things like that but not not too often no yeah I would think that like things like heart rate variability finding out if you're recovering correctly yeah not your your heart rate varies in the morning day to day but yeah that makes a big difference between if you're if you're doing something like Michael Phelps or someone Katrin I think so our track athlete where it's all these milliseconds I think for layer it's like I feel good today and I'm gonna go well there's a lot more natural it's more natural thing isn't it those days like you go wow I am I'm tired today and I'll just kind of do the best I can yeah but I think I understand wanting to measure things and also surf saying I feel tired because there's an interesting thing I'm feeling tired physically but you're actually emotionally tired because if you look at your metrics on your physical you have a lot more to give and so it's kind of then checking in and saying well what's going on for me I'm usually more tired personally than I am physically hmm my make sense you know like especially with your 11 year old giving you shit Rodie man she's awesome she's so but that's what I'm saying like this I could be wiped out right right I could train for an hour and I could hang out with birdie 13 minutes in the car and she's the victor like you know her foots on my hip and she's standing you know in the pose and that has been my lesson that's one of my many lessons ongoing lessons is like you can't you can go at everything head-on and I've learned that certainly being in a marriage I I developed a little bit of finesse and and as a parent just kind of going like I'm here to love you I'm here to support you and I'm also gonna recognize that you know you're probably not going to always do it hardly ever actually the way I I think you should or I want you to help so what made you guys start putting together the coffee and the superfood supplements and all that accident really what happened is is Laird used to he's been in as far as long as I've known him he's had coffee come from all around he's have coffee freak and then what happened is Paul check I don't know sixteen years ago gave him ghee in his coffee and the two of those animals would be like down in the coffee well getting all jacked up on caffeine and I'd be standing in the gym waiting for them being like oh my god like hanging out with these two you know for the next two hours ramped up on on a Faton and coffee which is basically the Dave Asprey concept of like yak butter tea and you know fat and things like that so the bulletproof concept so Larry used to start to mess around with elements to add to the caffeine for the performance and then we had a guy that we work with I think for about three years he'd have we'd have guys come over and they'd be like hey can you make me one of those coffees and after a while they'd start sending me emails like well how much coconut and how much this and how much that did he put in and our friend Paul was like do you mind if I try to put it together in a formula and I was like yeah whatever and it wasn't with the intention of having a business and then before you know it it came out and so then we have like original creamer with unsweetened there's tumeric there's hydrate products you know it's all based on things that Laird really eats and uses and you know mushroom blends that I actually put that's how I do my coffee in the mornings I put that in and and do that so you know that's another good example of like if you're doing something because you really believe in it and really and that business has we're really fortunate it's we have a factory in Sisters Oregon and they built another one oh wow yeah no it's we have know like they do everything like no co-packing partners we do it and now we're looking into farming ingredients and doing a drying factory so we can do that and put that into the product and things like that so I don't know I think it started from a genuine passion and and and came into that and you know I always say to like I started I was playing volleyball at 18 you know in college at 17 and then I started working and was sort of doing other jobs by 18 or 19 but Laird his path has been really different and really he didn't get in surfing people like they knew maybe knew who Laird was you sort of always on the outside but then it's it's really he was like 35 years old when someone from the outside went oh that's kind of cool so 35 would be considered old I think they're an athlete yeah and I think it's somebody who thought I have something inside me telling me to go forward and I think that I feel that same way like people have said to me like well why did you do this or that I go because I could feel it inside it's like you know that from what you do because you've done a lot of different things and and just kind of not only trying to develop that but try to trust it and say even though I've I've you know it I don't see it all clearly right now I feel it and I'm gonna just keep following that feeling and and it doesn't always lead to some grand destination but maybe that those lessons and that place lead you to the next which could be you know a place that you know brings you other things so yeah these businesses are just a natural byproduct of our lifestyle but it's pretty great it's pretty awesome got great stuff I do start drinking coffee toast 45 really yeah cuz I layered to be like because I think he was like try this one and try that and try this I like to caffeine I just wasn't into coffee how would you take it like your Bamonte eighties and stuff I get all jacked up on that stuff that stuff you ever drink that yeah yeah good stuff better go straight to whatever you're doing you're Montaigne I'm like Tommy could you get your stuff we're in the car you have your bags and there's like did you know your Bramante you know like crazy person with it so and now I've switched the caffeine with the fats but I I like it and I like the business aspect of it quite frankly like for me that's interesting too well you guys want the bed cool stuff well thank you energy more you're great on podcasts do you do podcast I had a podcast with Neil Strauss did you stop doing it yeah Neil's a busy guy and we had a your own we did it in the sauna we called the truth barrel that's what it was called we were literally in the sauna in our bathing suits because our group when we get together we were we would sit in the sauna and you know this if you have friends over you go hey you know what I'm having love problems okay we got eight minutes because 200° like let's get into it you're half naked so you're sort of there you are right and so i got an invitation to do a podcast and so I thought Neil and I are so very very different like really different and I thought it'd be more interesting to have us with our points of view because then you also realize that as different as we are is we're really looking for the same things we're trying to figure out love we're trying to be parents we're trying to work take care of ourselves age whatever all the stuff you're navigating and so we did that for like a year and a half it was a lot of fun and people were like in there in their bathing suits wedding at my house in the sauna in the truth barrel because that's what we always called it you can't lie in the sauna but they're only like 10 minutes long no we would we would open the door oh but it was like I try to turn it way down cuz Laird has our sauna - 220 220 go in there didn't cook - no it's exactly right but if you couple it with the ice you're sort of grateful for the 220 so I would turn it I try to turn it down to like 120 and inevitably the next day when it was our real life's awning lards like who's been messing with the dial of my sauna you know it's like this whole thing and I'm like well we were shooting we can't sit in there for an hour you see people they're like can I go out and they jump in the pool and then come back in this is really fun I liked it because there's something like you just get right to it right well why don't you just do it on your own you know what Joe I listen to your podcast a lot and I think to myself very few people can do what you do I think it's really important to not only like recognize someone does something really well because everyone thinks all I could do that it's like well no you can actually and so for me I'm very curious about people and you know I used to do a lot of TV where I'd interview athletes like that was more interesting to me than being interviewed because that's how you've learned like you go okay how do you do it I know how I do it I don't need to know that I need to know what you're doing and um I just think it's it does interest me but I would want to do it right and not just assume like you can do it because to do it really well is it's a special talent I just had a lot of practice go back and listen to the early ones they sucked just you just get better at me ya know and I get that too but I think it's just knowing I think this is important in all things in life because we like something not not maybe for me because I do really like this is just because we like something doesn't mean we have to do that too right like I think it's still like drilling down on you know what do you want to do like because when I hear you go from a comedian to like a scientist a physicist to you know it's like it shows your genuine passions in all these areas and that's what's interesting I mean I always want to talk about like how do you get it done I'm so interested in how people if they can arrive at any place where there's a sense of like joy moving in and out of their life and self-care mmm and because I think when people talk about health and fitness or wellness I think they're off the mark about what it really is I think for me what I've learned is like I train and eat well just so I have a fighting chance to support any kind of happiness and it isn't just about like I'm ripped you know not me but like this notion of what people are putting out there that Fitness is it's like that's all great but if you still haven't figured out some of these other things as a person it's like I don't know it seems like you're wrestling the wrong things so I'm always really interested in and also not only how they get it done but also not making it seem like it's so easy you like my people I always joke like when people do interviews and they go how are your children they're amazing and I'm like my kids are amazing too and they you know crush our balls on daily basis and isn't that everybody's house you know or people you know say to me I mean do you and learn ever fight I mean we have and we haven't always had perfect you know like there's been time so it was like maybe we're not gonna stay together and I guess for me that would be really interesting is to communicate in a way that's like it's not gratuitous but at least like hey you're being kind of honest about like what it is yeah you know and and and now like I'm almost 50 it's like even aging like having or having a realistic but good conversation about like hey how's that going you know not like I feel great I do feel great I do I feel great I'm sure you do but there are days where you know you go oh time of real human times moving yeah I said sometimes I said that to laird cuz you know you don't want to be that wife do I look all T oh it's like he doesn't notice you know what I mean and I said I said today I it was funny I had a thing like I realized like times moving and he goes mm-hmm because he knows what that means and I'm sparing him that whole conversation like a girlfriend conversation that's like not one that you have with your partner I think it's important to like you know go down the hole with him on other things right I do observe that sometimes I look outside I go yeah this is not a conversation you want to have with Laird save that for you know your your girlfriend you have so much to say I think it's like a natural progression for you to do it another podcast for do to do your own I don't know so much I think I'm so boring boring no I swear to God I feel like you know it's probably cuz you think about yourself so much you're probably annoyed that you're thinking about yourself you wanna fix this and change that and adapt here and evolve there you know if you're really paying attention why it was even a decent athlete is this like I was just trying to I was just trying to get it yeah and and I know as a human we can never get it right and that's a moving target but I feel like the pursuit of trying to be one's best self in the ISM is probably worth spending some time on you you appreciate your existence more I think when you are on that path I think so and I think I think especially when you've had the opportunity also to do a lot of really cool stuff I almost think it becomes a responsibility because you're not fighting certain fights right like certain battles you don't even like I don't have to I have three jobs but I chose three jobs it's not like you're just make trying to survive like those people it's like hey I get it but I feel like if you go like hey I got to do that and this and this it's like yeah cool what are you doing like what what else are you gonna do you know I think that that becomes a worthy task and also like I'm trying to stay in my I'm trying to stay married I'm trying to be a decent mom things like that and so that takes probably some work well it does but I really think that there's value in expressing that and that you know yes I do yeah I'm sure a lot of people are agreeing right now like yeah do a podcast you know what it is this is what I might ultimately be is that somehow and this is I think why I love your your show because I hear it over and over and you don't say it per se of saying it but it's there always in an underlying way it's like power and love always like be your most badass self all the time that you can have fun kick ass and maybe be kind yeah like for me those are the ultimate because every all the people that I see there I'm like oh they could kick your ass and love you you know I think that's really powerful I mean I respond to that because it you know it feels important right now I think you're absolutely right I think this is a good way to end this okay let's do it Mahalo so thank you Thank You kini I really appreciate it enjoyed it thank you um tell people your Instagram your your social media I'm Gabby Reece if they want to check out the pool training xpt and just get people to take care of themselves Mahalo bye everybody [Music]
