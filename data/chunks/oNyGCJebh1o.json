hello freak bitches they call this pattern isset e the tendency to find meaningful patterns in both meaningful and meaningless noise and my thought experiment is imagine you're a hominid on the plains of Africa three-and-a-half million years ago small brain australopithecine your name is Lucy and you hear a rustle in the grass is it a dangerous predator or is it just the wind right so if you assume that the wrestle on the grass is a dangerous predator and it turns out it's just the wind that's a type 1 error false positive you thought a was connected to B but but no harm you just become skittish and cautious or whatever but if you assume that the rustle in the grass is just the wind and it turns out it's a dangerous predator your lunch just been given a Darwin Award for taking yourself out of the gene pool early before reproducing so in other words it's better to just assume that all things you think are connected all rustles in the grass are dangerous predators and not the wind just in case and there's not there's not a big cost to pay for making a type 1 error false positive there's a higher cost for making a type 2 error or false negative so we assume that this is the basis of superstition and magical thinking we just assume that this is connected to that you pull the slot you do this you pull the slot machine you win or whatever and this is what Skinner showed back in the 50s where you just randomly give reinforcements to rats and pigeons and whatever they were doing just before they got rewarded they'll just repeat that behavior even if it's like twirling counterclockwise twice or and that's the basis of superstition it there's nothing wrong with their brains they're just trying to find causal connections between events in the environment and that's the basis of survival so all of us are subject to making those connections some are more gullible than others say or more skeptical but for the most part all of us can easily be fooled if it's done right that's that's the beauty of good cons good scams is that anybody could fall for them even smart people and if anything smart people are more likely to believe weird things in this sense that once they believe it they think they've drawn a connection they're better at rationalizing the reasons why they believe then say less educated or less intelligent people and so as people like Banacek will tell you there's nothing better than an audience of scientists at MIT oh boy I can really fool them because they think they're so smart I can't be fool to Wow okay he must be doing something really really super psychic because you know I'm super smart but well no because all of our sensory apparatus works the same and magicians know how to manipulate your gaze your attention whatever and how to fool you what made him think this was it was Bigfoot shit they wanna smell like their shit bro smell it smell it agree on what it eats they were so sure food shit they can't agree can't agree on what Bigfoot eats I'm good who the fuck discovered that Bigfoot's yeah we gotta find that dude I met that I had a conversation with him too it's a nice guy he's a teacher okay in a school what did he find a teacher in Oregon found it out in the woods he's like this got to be a Bigfoot yep I'm gonna take it with me I would think big that would lay logs like this big is my thigh just giant you ever see a elephant take shit and you see his asshole holding up and he go good lord just out of there this giant asshole that's what I imagine for Bigfoot do you believe that there you know some people believe in Bigfoot but they also believe in a different kind of Bigfoot it's like a different kind of like Christian Church that Lutheran they believe yes we believe in Bigfoot but we believe it's an interdimensional being I've heard that one what do you think the chances of that okay I gotta stop right here bro I'm one-eighth Native American I'm a grandmother sign and those are our people I will have long known of the existence of what we call the OL ma I have a bunch different names for it you know what when it does a new name every time I go up to Oregon or Washington or do a seminar the guys by show of hands who believes in Bigfoot and most of them do most of them do yeah we've heard stories you know I believed in it for the longest time and I don't disbelieve in it today I don't disbelieve in it but that's one you can make fun of but I if they found Bigfoot I wouldn't be like oh shit that's real I definitely don't disbelieve in it and you know what and I'll just say it I think maybe he is interdimensional you know and I mean that's how that's my gut feeling it's ridiculous the things that are going on that are getting covered up and nobody's talking about like in the film I don't know if you saw that drug that was made in the United States it was tainted with AIDS she it was tainted with the AIDS virus and they said you know what we can't lose this big batch of drugs let's send it to France I don't understand that though how does the AIDS virus get in this what is the AIDS virus you're talking about HIV yeah and I have no idea but that's what the news report says that news report was all grainy no in 1985 they might not know what the fuck they were talking about no it would definitely was something that was a head scratcher and I actually have a guy there's a guy that works out at marks gym just got his PhD and he was gonna go work for the company bear that was a company that sold they make Bayer Aspirin everything that's to come that did it and I was one of the things he was he was talking about I don't know if I want to work for a company like that yeah we need to Snopes that though Snopes that actually actually yes we we have a big team taste taste a few of those documentaries we have look at this we have a fact check everything make that a little larger please here goes recently unearthed documents show that the drug company Bayer sold millions of dollars worth of injectable blood clotting medicine factor eight concentrate intended for hemophiliacs to Asian Latin American and some European countries in the mid 1980s although they knew it was tainted with AIDS see that's one I understand like how does something hate and AIDS go together that makes sense this article is ten years ago it says the company stopped selling the drug in the United States in 1984 but continued to sell it overseas for an additional year the medicine was made using combined oh okay plasma from large numbers of donors and at the time there was no screening test for eight for the AIDS virus so a tiny number of donors with AIDS could inadvertently contaminate a large batch whoa they continued to sell the medicine overseas in an attempt to avoid being left with a large stock of a drug that was no longer marketable in the United States I have been so obsessed with this lately like this and I know that I've like probably we've talked about this before and I talked about people probably get sick of me talking about it but this concept of stressing your body stressing exercise most people think exercise is good because the exercise itself is good no the extra say this exercise itself is not good it's actually very stressful on your body what's good is the stress response the body we've got a hardwired genetic program that is conserved in plants insects bacteria you know primates humans you know where we're all we all have this response to stress and that response is to try to survive I need to you know I need to stay alive pass on my genes obviously the stress response is much stronger younger when you're younger or the earlier in life because your body knows your new hat you're not old enough you know to reproduce for whatever you know hormones and things like that they're not being produced but so the stress response which is like exercise causes stress thermal stress like heat cold and then there's all these like compounds and plants that are stressful to us that can induce this but it's almost like the brain is preparing for the next time it's going to encounter stress it's like okay this is war I know how to gather up the troops oh I got to get this army we got to assemble this army because that stress is gonna happen again I got to be ready for war so it kind of makes sense that you're you know you're going to have a very profound and positive effect in your brain and also in other parts of the I'm you know the exercise itself it's funny because a lot of people do it to lose weight or to mostly to lose weight or you know become sexually attractive muscle mass which has other very important physiological you know effects but people do it because they want to look good and honestly a lot of there are a lot of people that say well exercise doesn't really play an important role in losing weights nutrition you know what they're right but exercise has a very important role and that role is to to cause your body stress so that you activate all these really good and awesome genes that are helping you deal with stress and guess what stress is happening right now every time you breathe in oxygen you're making stress you're you're generating byproducts that are very dangerous so so exercise is good [Music]
