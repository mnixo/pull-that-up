tested yesterday and I got tested two days before that so and I'm just gonna test myself every four days fuck it so I'm testing everybody so the way we're doing this here is when people come in to do the podcast test them first keep the fuck away from and then give up you're the first person I've hugged in a month fuck it feel good honestly you know what's you know what's uh what's why I want to

symptoms or what so will fatigue yeah yeah he's like now it feels great that's the thing about me is like I'll hear a thing and then be like doing this but there's a thing on CNN today that said as many as 70% of the people it's between 50 and 70 percent of the people that test positive nothing Wow so they're saying that way more people have this than they previously thought right so the risk of hospitalization and/or death although it's still tragic and terrible saying it's way lower than they thought which is great but at least this is like a dry run like now if something really bad happens now at least look I'm looking at on the positive side we know that we can get the country to lock down basically not everybody but that no fro there's nothin ever gonna be anything where everybody complies no way but pretty remarkable how many just drive around here man it's drunk highway it's crazy so I am Legend out there the street I know I must brought my dog it's I I thought I thought

part of living in California they're everywhere man they're all in Burbank now I was driving down olive and I saw three coyotes I'm like in the day Wow and now because there's no one driving apparently there ever yeah they're all over the place now I saw dude I was in Burbank once it was probably one we were going to in and out so it was about to close and it was like one you know whatever 1:00 a.m. whenever the close and I was 21 at the time I was my buddy was driving I was in the passenger seat and we were crossing the bridge to the downtown Burbank I don't know if you've ever been there maybe you know but like there's a bridge from like the valley to where you cross it's very little but I was crossing this bridge and there was all of a sudden across the bridge a deer runs across the bridge in front of the car gets scared of our car and jumps off the bridge yeah it jumps off the bridge so there were three of us in the car we all went bitches yeah like straight up we all went and he kept driving because he was shocked and I was like hold us you know stop and he just drove he kept driving and then and I and he was like did you see that that was a fucking deer and I convinced myself I was like I think about this like every three months I was like that couldn't have happened right like first of all a deer in downtown Burbank and then just jumping to its death and he's like a little scared because the car and I was like maybe like her headlights hit it weird and maybe it was like a bag and my buddy said fuck you do it it was a deer and you know it and I try I was like trying to convince myself that was just a bag in the light cuz it was dark but it was absolutely a fucking deer man so it just jumped over the fence that happens all the time on bridges you know no I didn't know that yeah did deer jump to their death all the time guys so it's a common thing yeah they jump to the death into the river they jump to their death and land on the highway yeah yeah they're not that bright I mean I sure and they panic yeah they tell this thing fucking panic they see lights they see head that's why that's expression deer your headlights yeah they don't know what the fuck to do look at look at these deer so fucked yeah that's exactly what yes it wasn't it could have been a cult formed for deer though they just say this is the day we do it they can swim I've seen deer swim when Carolyn and I went deer hunting we watched these deer swim we've that video where he's talking about shitting him his pants is the fuck you laughing puts it over the top you with tears in your eyes camo on trying to be quiet that's like the perfect storm for shit that I think is funny well when Carol and I the first time we went we were in Montana for six days in camping and it was it was one long either gay or joke this is in Wisconsin yeah behind us yeah [Laughter] [Laughter] [Music] that couldn't have been if that was done on stage or any other situation would have been is funny like that's so funny that you guys had to be quiet well you get bored I know we're standing in your lap and this feel because it's loopy because you're looping a deer comes out and then Brian starts talking about shooting himself fuck man I love shit like that man I love shit like that I do if you I think if you like any age is fun the shitting shitting herself is funny yeah except when you're really old then it's sad no but what I'm saying is if you're 80 and you heard that story you'd still laugh yeah not if it happened to you when you were 80 if you happen to when you're a menace especially if you're a lady like I'm an 85 year old man and I shit myself feel free to laugh sure we have your blood your permission yeah but old ladies it's like oh the last time I I've never I've only shit myself once and I was I think 11 all right yes you're not taking enough chances I've almost shit myself and just made it so many times but the last time I almost shit myself and I had to pull over and was when I was going to meet mmm [Laughter] smelling like shit no underwear on then you have to figure out what to do so that you take your socks off 100% again not wearing socks and and and so I was in this the Sprinter van and we were going you know I was on tour so I had the Sprinter van we were going to there how did that whole thing happens because you make fun of them yeah and so he thought it was funny right so I was at my old house this was maybe two years ago at this point and I was in the driveway I don't remember what I was doing but I was waiting for something and it had been right around the time where like Eminem's album came out or something so he was on my mind and I was like I was thinking about him and then I was just like this is how he wraps and then I just started doing it to the radio and then I was like as is funny I'm gonna record it and then I recorded it one time I was just like that's funny I'll put it online and I put it online and it got you know traction for me it was like it had a lot of hits for me on my Instagram and I was like cool great and then like a month later black Twitter took it and just was like yo this is this guy says this is how they didn't know nobody knew who I was what they were like this is this guy says this is how Eminem raps and then it got millions of things of hits on Twitter and then it got so big my buddies were like you think Eminem is probably seeing it right and I was like it's so big maybe it was one of his buddies must have seen it and showed him and then like a week or two later my buddy texted me one of the writers from that show I used to do undateable and he was like bro Eminem and I was like what and he was like you didn't see check Twitter and I checked and he was like I thought this was me and I was like what like that's like if you told the 20 year old me that Eminem was gonna and then he started being like I will bat rap battle Chris D'Elia one down if you saw that yeah I didn't see that yeah he was like I'm gonna rap out of Chris D'Elia one day and I'm like am I in the hip-hop game now and and and and then I don't know how much you know about this but then logic the rapper hit me up well my manager called me and he was like hey so look you know how logic is another man my every manager has that voice look Josh Lieberman so I don't have you know the logic and rapper like of course I do and he was like all right so look he's doing a song on Eminem and he they are rapping together and I mean him Eminem put your your impression Eminem on the back of the song and they're wondering if that's okay and I was like of course that's okay he was like I'm gonna look into it and see I'm like no no no no don't ask for any money just let him have it are you kidding me that this is even happening he was like okay okay and so then he comes back he's like analodjica wants your number I was like yeah okay so I'm talking logic and logic psych so I have a great idea for the video I want you to play Eminem in this video you seen this video no no everyone google it but we're looking at it on the screen yeah oh you could see it right but not play it so this is so I'm playing Eminem in this video I rap his part and now this is the crazy part okay so like I'm talking to logic here and I play this like super fan of Eminem and he's like I have an idea I want we're doing a video and I'm like I'm Way ahead of you I got this is we're way ahead yeah and then I take off my wig and I have always been an Eminem like Stan and this is me doing you got to watch this video so so I'm doing this video as Eminem right and we shoot this and then at the end you've seen the video where I do the impression of Emmett yeah at the end the Lea doesn't play me I played earlier this is Eminem dressed as me that's Eminem doing me in my car in my driveway two years ago but so and and like to think of me as a 20 year old like thinking like finding out who Eminem was and then him becoming one of my favorite rappers of course and then it's just such a weird fucking thing so that was mind-blowing and then on the way to meet him I shit my fucking eye I had to pull the Sprinter van over and he has no idea but dude it was so funny I it was just one of those things where I was like I think you know how you have your like I think I have to shit and the next thought is I got a shit right now I mean there's no thinking involved it's a oh it turned into Oh exactly right so I say to the Sprinter the driver I say hey buddy um can you pull off the freeway I got a in my head I'm like I got time if there's a bathroom near right so I'm like can you pull over and and and find the first place I gotta go to the bathroom and he says okay and then a few seconds go by and I say hey just so you know like now you know and it cuz I got I'm working on something here I got and he says sure enough that no problem so he pulls off and and there are two ways he can go and one way he can go there is only a hospital okay and the other way he can go is into town so I'm Leigh in my head I'm like it sucks but we gotta go to the hospital use the bathroom in the hospital and I'm gonna run in they're gonna think something's wrong but I'm just gonna be like where's the bathroom I gotta go this guy goes the other way into town to find a gas station so now I'm mad so now I have to shit and I'm mad so I say to the guy hey man um pull over and he pulls over and I open the thing and there were Kleenex there I grabbed him and I ran into someone's yard it was in the middle of nowhere dude it wasn't we were going on our way to Detroit and I sand and I was in someone's yard a rep I found trees thank God pulled down my pants and it all came out quick and and it was diarrhea or is it shit it was not it was not shit it was not shit it was just it came out it was just like right came out like a barking dog and it was over it was over before it even started you know and and I was I thought so much better and then I used the Kleenex and my openers in the in the in the thing filming me I'm like bro I swear to God if that ends up on on Instagram I will fuckin you're done you're done you're done you're done and not only that you're not meeting a man in someone's yard hey you're not meeting me was that just in some random guys yard and and so so now I feel great I wipe with the Kleenex and I just I'm sorry I littered but I left the clinic said what am I gonna do well are you and it was a it was a lot and I was like and I will and I left I got back in the thing I was like that was amazing I was like somebody's gonna think there was a fucking bobcat in their yard like I just and we went and we met Eminem and he had no idea maybe he'll know now sure you've seen the show but yeah myself on the way to fucking Eminem so I don't really cutting myself you know what I mean because I got outside and did it yeah it's a gray area you made it I made it yeah I've shit myself many too many to count for sure but how many of those times were you on a substance no no it's not that doesn't add to it no it's usually when I'm in the car no but the last time was it's been a few years I said I did have a disaster happen in the shower not too long ago the best talk last place to have it I had to like shampoo I had a my diary it in the shower and then I have one um

bagel down you know and I'm running to the hotel and I get to the I was like and I know and I got to the point where I got to the elevator and was like if this elevator isn't here on this floor I'm shitting in the elevator so I hit the thing open I'm like I'm amazing amazing thank you Jesus even though you know I don't even really believe in it maybe I do maybe I don't but so I get to the fucking in the in the elevator and I'm like I got to start unbuttoning my pants right now because I don't have a second to spare so I'm bucking in my pants door opens nobody's there great I'm running down the hall holding my pants and I open the door to my hotel room and it was set up to where there's the open there's the door then there's a little bit of space and then there's the bathroom and the toilet is here so I had it in my head I was like okay I'm just gonna undo my pants and I'm gonna swing around and sit on the toilet and like I don't have second I don't have one second to spare so I'm like I got this I got the layout and I open the thing the keys got to work it works perfect you know somebody's got to do it twice I get in I swing around and I'm taking my pants as like the matrix I'm swinging my pants my my butt and my pants man and I I can't help it and at the last second I just go and I spray the wall I just spraying the wall on the way to the toilet and I sit and I got an eye and I'm and I'm too happy I know I gotta clean the bathroom but I'm too happy who cuz I you made it I made I made it you know I mean yeah imagine if you did pray to God that the elevator was there and then like one day you like fall off a cliff with a broken leg and you're dying and you're like please God save me the gods like don't you use that up when you shit at the Soho grand got that elevator for you do you remember that yeah that's it that was the one you get you get one I would still honestly be like thank you I get it if I could just fill my pants up fill my pants up and take it like a man yeah make it up to that you know that's the thing about that's the thing about being part of the thing about being a comedian is like I started stand-up when I was 25 and after that just from like bombing and everything like I don't really get embarrassed do you feel same way not the same way like if I shit my pants in public yeah and everyone was like ah you shit your pants I'd be like you've all fucking shit your pants assholes you have a bit now exactly a hundred percent but at before I did stand-up when you bomb in front of 300 400 a thousand people yeah there's nothing worse than that I'd rather shit my pants also you know I don't care about you don't take yourself as seriously because you can't really I mean you're making fun of everything including your friends your friends are always making friend of you yeah no one serious anyone no one's the cool guy there's no cool yeah yeah everyone's a loser you're a loser I'm a loser we're losers Wayne it's just there's there's moments in life where you you take the L I know and you just gotta laugh I know you guys don't know how to do that though because they want to be wanna be the cool guy yeah the cool guy it's but comedians you have to that's the one thing there are comedians out there that don't have that which is odd they're not funny but they're I don't think they're funny yeah they can't be fun but you have to have humility yes like I mean take it from you you're an alpha and like but you go onstage you make fun of yourself well I'm retarded there's a lot of stuff to make fun of you everyone should make fun of themselves it's like look any time you can make fun of something as long as you're not like terribly hurting someone's feelings sure you have an opportunity for laughs yeah laughs are good laughs make you feel better trying to make somebody happy yeah you feel happy like when my kids make fun of me all the time I am the butt of jokes cons your dad that's funny your dad I'm not just a like I'm dad's a dummy like it's always like but it's funny like when they when they make fun of me I'll go hey I'm your father I write write oh my god you're doomed you have my DNA haha man think it's like but I could think about the relationship of you and Kalin how uh-huh like you will go on stage while he's on stage did you start shitting on he'll start shitting is your best but you love each other I would love you it's like that doesn't exist in most men yeah yeah yeah most men your age men are super sensitive about that kind of stuff they don't want to ever lose face they have to go into business meetings and fucking handle things like a like an executive I can't I can't I can't imagine that life for me yeah it's like just honest life my upbringing though all we did my parents all we did was make fun all we did was make fun of each other like all we did was fucking bust on each other and we would laugh I mean we were you know whether it was my mom or my dad or my brother my uncle my we all make fun of each other and it was how we showed we love each other that's funny I didn't have any of that really yeah my house was humorless Wow totally humorless so how the fuck did you become a comedian like what is it about that from fighting what do you mean because I was traveling from the time I have fucked up like adolescents in high school time and from the time I was 15 until I was like 21 22 all it did was compete in martial arts tournaments so we were always nervous so I was traveling to these tournaments to fight and I would be the guy that made fun of every thought yeah so I would like in the locker room when we're about to spar yeah I would do impressions of everybody having sex I was the guy who like I would do I would be the icebreaker you know I would break the tension I would be the guy that made fun of everything that was how I coped with the stress and then my friend Steve who I'm still very good friends with this today my friend Steve Graham he's like you should be a comedian like that's literally how I became in community and how old were you like at the time he told me that I think I was 19 gotcha I was 19 or 20 and I was like come on man like I couldn't even go to clubs yet because you didn't perform until you were 21 I thought turns out you could you just couldn't drink it had to leave once a while stage and leave yeah yeah but I didn't know that yeah so I waited 21 but he was like because I would make them laugh but I'm like but you guys are a bunch of psychos right I'm an asshole right right I'm like other people are not gonna think what I think when I say it's fun yeah and he's like I think you're really funny and I think he should be a comedian and so then you got on stage soon after when I was 21 right after my 21st birthday yeah Wow and then I was like okay this is what I'm gonna do now like right away I knew it I mean it wasn't like I was good or anything but I was like I think I can do this well who's good in the beginning no one yeah if no way you're good you're let me let's clear this up you are not good if you just started no I thought I thought I was yes and then I saw video about a few years after I started and I wasn't no you're just not able to be a good comedian but you know who has a spark you people that have a spark is Alcoholics Anonymous people you know why because they go to those meetings and sometimes they get yeah and act together yeah they develop an act because they're telling these crazy stories about shit they did when they were on drugs and drunk right and sometimes they're really funny you know there was a guy named Dave Fitzgerald that got him to stand up when I was like 21 when I met him and he had been doing it maybe a year or so and he was already like in his late 30s but he was funny already and he was funny because he had been doing Alcoholics Anonymous for years yeah so and yeah fucked up yeah time with drugs and drinking so he had all these crazy stories of just cops and fucking gay fights and chaos and blacking out waking up shit in your pants and just madness so he and he had a great voice it was fuckin gravelly voice yeah so he would go onstage and tell these crazy stories and so he started out like right away kind of funny uh-huh I just feel like because I start when I started stand-up I started it with a buddy of mine like he he would come with me and we would do open mics not on the stage together but I would go up and then he would go up and he had never been on stage before and I you know did plays and shit and when I was in in high school and I realized that you you don't just it's not that you're learning how to be funny onstage you also have to learn how to be onstage you're just a part of it which you don't I didn't realize that until I saw me and then I saw him because he would be doing shit like holding his ankle talking and I'm like he would come on stage and I'd be like hey man why are you holding her ankle he'd be like what and I was like did you not know you were doing that he was like oh I don't know no I know I was like Jesus Christ this guy's not even aware of what its ban on one leg yeah holding an ankle yeah I think you look like a fucking insecure bitch you're stark yes yes doc historic but or Pelican with someone that holds the leg up ah flamingo flamingo carries the baby yeah no but he no and then he stopped three months later but but uh but yeah it was like I I realized I had a leg up on him because I had done like at least plays and been on stage and knew where an audience was and yeah there's little things he was teaching so I was teaching time I used to teaching large groups of people so I was used to communicate yeah you can use that stuff that obviously helps and then but yeah that helped it helped a little bit but not much no not my house terrible but but I knew that I could do it I was like you did yeah I was like I'm I know I suck but I know this is a thing you can get better so you knew when you were starting that you were not good oh yeah yeah yeah no that's one good thing about growing up doing martial arts yeah martial arts shows you where you're at with no questions because when you're sparring or something they're gonna lose you if you get your ass kicked like I'm not good right you can never get your ass kicked and go I'm fucking pretty awesome that's a very good point yeah you feel you losing a fight is very humiliating it's very humiliating so I knew like right away I wasn't good but I also was like I see cuz luckily the night that I went up Jonathan Katz you know Jonathan Katz from dr. Katz that of the open mic night the first time I went up and then there was this guy Teddy Bergeron he went on stage that night who was amazing and all these different guys that were like local Boston guys that went up that were professionals went up that night too so I got to see open mic errs and I got to see professionals and I was like okay this something you can get good at like this is something that if you practice and you write and you just keep working at it and you keep performing like I kind of had a vague sense even the first time that I did it like I could do this I could do this and then I did it a second time second time was better than the first time and I'm like okay so I'm more comfortable now I did a little bit better like there's something to this I can I can do this so I knew right away like within the first SEC first or second time that I did it that this was gonna what I was gonna try to do that's cool that's fun I start when I was 25 always always wanted to be a comedian always since I was I mean young my dad tells a story where when I was um playing with my toys in front of the TV my dad was watching a Jerry Lewis movie and Jerry Lewis was doing his fucking crazy Jerry Lewis shit on TV and I was playing my stories my toys and I stopped and I started watching Jerry Lewis because he was been crazy on television and doing his funny stuff and he said some my dad and kind of noticed and registered that I was playing with my toys and stopped and now was arrested by this by this movie and Jerry Lewis and in he's and he's a few beats went by and then I said hey Dad and he said yeah and I said this guy on TV what he's doing all that silly stuff this is his job and my dad said yeah and I said like he makes money doing this and my dad said yeah man fuck he makes a lot of money doing that and I said and then he my dad said I went like this huh and he said that that was the moment that he kind of like likes to romanticize about how I thought I wanted to be a comedian but I wanted to be a comedian my whole life man and I was scared to do it until I was 25 because I was like I'm at a loss here what am i doing I was trying to write I was trying to you know get scripts turned into movies and I was trying to work on you know be an actor but it was like you you can't do that without other people yeah so as a comedian I was like alright fuck I always wanted to stand up this is the time I'm 25 I turned it was like 2005 or 2006 2006 New Year's resolution January 2nd I got on stage I forced myself to do it and then I got on stage just every day ever since you know what I mean Wow no you oh you are on stage basically every night I just knew that you know there's a whole 10,000 hours right if you're and dude I would go to the Comedy Store in the at 9:00 and I I wasn't I wasn't past or anything I remember I met max Amini you know him no okay so he he would run the belly room show and I met him somehow and we got a light turn we like we started we took a like into each other and I said I said look I'm gonna come by and hang out with you I'm not asking to go up do it I just want to come and hang and like soak it in or whatever and have a go at 9:00 and I would leave at 2:00 a.m. every single fucking night every single night and more often than not he would throw me up and you know I would I would I would never push it I hate that shit I don't want to be like hey man you go to spa like I just if you want me to be on the show then I want to be on the show if you don't want me to be on the show I don't wanna be on the show and I would just get good in the belly room and and by the you know 2627 I would do it for years and then you did the ha - right I started at the haha I was do the ha has a great spot man it's it's it I the Comedy Store came after the ha ha but the ha ha was where I got my first like start because nobody would go there and I would go and there were real people in the audience yeah and you could get on stage in real shows as a young you know I had no business being on a real show but I would go and I would do my shit and I paid $5.00 for the open mic in the beginning yeah and that way they make you pay the gone I know and people would be like I paying fuck down I'm like look I'm just gonna so if you've done all these years of every night basically doing stand-up what is this month been like for you this month this Kuantan month has it been weird this is the longest I've ever been in a string of being not on stage I want to be there the first night everybody me - I see - I dude I thought about this the other day I'm like I had let you know my special comes out today so it's you know you could watch it on fucking never what's it called Chris no pain it's on right now it's got no pain and you know see it right now yeah yeah you can see it right now it's streaming absolutely on Netflix so um no so uh but I'm my point of bringing it up not to plug it but I'm so happy it came out now because I don't have material that I've been you like I know like Ali Wong had to reschedule her fucking taping oh no she was ready to go well Louie was supposed to film he was supposed to film his shit it was like April 12th and I wasn't gonna be able to make it I wanted to see his tape it oh really yeah I was doing to try to three days ago you're saying he was gonna do it in Boston he was gonna do when he I think it was April 12th he was scheduled in Boston it was like the same weekend what might be like this weekend but it came out yeah yeah yeah but he didn't he scheduled was it was supposed to be a couple days ago so today's Tuesday he was supposed to be like Saturday this past about it and they had to do he scrambled last minute and filmed it in Washington DC and they just put it out he's like fuck it I'm just gonna put it out on my website but he was supposed to be filming like a couple of weeks later like now and when everything started closed and never to realize like whoa this shit's getting weird yeah shit's getting really weird he bumped it up yeah quite a few people have canceled filming's Schultz Andrew short he did - yeah I'm supposed to be I think he was supposed to be this mental ready now yeah I think he was supposed to be in LA Saturday as well yeah I think it's the same thing yeah I was texting with him he's like I think I got a reschedule yeah I think I was texting with him yeah I met up Louie was the week before whatever it's it's all rally I know Ally reschedule where was she supposed to film I think t see I think and then she was gonna and then she was talking to me she was like I'm gonna I might I might she's like I've rescheduled it for either June or July she's like I'm gonna have the reschedule it again yes yes so because the other thing is - once they lift the ban of going out you think everyone's gonna run to a 2000 seater fucking real dummies yeah exact solid dummies are gonna be out there coffin in each other's mouths those are my fans come on out dummies yeah bunch of bug chasers yeah I think there's gonna be a lot of people to go out I think there will be the dummies that are like fuck you and finally there's gonna be people that are right first of all delusional second of all relatively healthy and not concerned right a lot of vitamin C right do the right thing sleep sleep well I've been really good with like all my stuff like I've been in the sauna every night for 25 minutes I take several thousand milligrams of vitamin C every day vitamin D taking all my vitamins I do a vitamin drip with any dude once a week so I will you talk about with Whitney on the text chain yeah yeah nad drips yeah that's the same doctor that his compound does that they do the the vitamin D drips cool the the vitamin drips rather not vitamin D blood like glutathione it's got to think all kinds of shit they put they put a bunch of shit what why you tried saw you on the talking to her on the texting you were saying that you need to you're trying to shorten the amount of time of doing it but you can't because it's overwhelming or something well nad is this stuff what is it what is the name of it they pull the name of this nad shit like you can't do it standing up person she does it standing up I don't understand that but what you're doing here it goes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide it's a cofactor that is central to metabolism found in all living cells and AD is called die nucleotide because it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups you know about all this what I'd contains the adenine anyway really good for you great for the therapy says vitals functions like repairing DNA maintaining cell health and boosting our immune system so it gives you energy increases energy and gives your metabolism a boost so I do that once a week now and it's supposed to take two hours the first time I did well I got it under an hour and then I've been doing it in 24 minutes the last couple ones so it's yeah so you build up like a tolerance to it or just doing it I don't know if you build a tolerance and you just get accustomed to yeah it's very uncomfortable mmm we're like you've got it so really it's real weird and where do they shoot you in yeah it's an IV yeah so you're sitting there and so I just just try to see how much I can tolerate my goal is to get it down to ten minutes which i think is totally doable yeah to do it in 10 minutes just open it up and just just sit there and meditate and take it and then so at the end it the the uncomfortableness is completely over gone oh it's just during while it's while it's happening so for 24 minutes I'm just sitting there yeah but what we do is Jamie and I've been doing it we just watch Black Mirror yeah oh we haven't seen that yet I haven't seen all of them I've seen like seven or eight of them but goddamn that one we watched last week black Museum this was fuck that's good dude some of them are that show is like I think for that show to be good it has to be hit or miss because they have to take chances yes some of them are so fucking good that I that show was just amazing some of them are spooky yeah this black mirror black Museum episode was fucking incredible I remember the one that one mess my head yeah like I was sitting there at night just going Jesus the one yeah the one why don't say yeah but it's great yeah it's great the other one I love is the one where the guy is in Star Trek yeah he he has like a virtual Star Trek yeah yeah king of the world has all these people I remember that one oh the best ones are the first ones though you saw them we went back and watch the first ones I've seen some of the first ones a lot the first season is I remember you posting about the new season when you were talking about you know I think it would be the first time you really watch the show but I saw it when I didn't know what it was and I was and it like blew my fucking mind like nobody had talked about it and I was like and I saw I was like oh my god I don't even was it on Netflix in the beginning or no I don't think it was whatever but was it I don't know first I don't know maybe oh that's right yes yes yes no the first the first episodes I don't know if it's cuz I didn't know what it was but those blew my fucking mind man it's the one it's like the new Twilight the robots chasing lady the little little drone robots a little oh that's freaky yeah what does that call heavy Matt isn't that one in black and white or no did I imagine that it is okay yeah I know I made a creepy yeah like creepier I don't know it is though really yeah hmm pikas old shit is creepy and that's used to be like those it's like an added layer of depression because everybody in it's dead yeah have you watched like the old time movie all those people are doing now you look at the dead people everything sucked back tense even being alive so bad so bad I guess what even the show you're watching sucked because they're old time capsule right my dad would watch fucking like old black and what like combat that show with like we're like everybody was talking like this come on it's like talk like that dragnet yeah you ever see that show yeah Joe Friday yeah we gotcha we got you red-handed I want to do a show where I do that voice and it's a fucking drama and it comes out now well there's certain things you used to be able to do that you should have never been able to do that you can't do anymore and that's one you can't be like you can't have a stage voice anymore no you can't be corny like that anymore now but you can still do that if you are in the radio yeah I like talking about you need to talk about this yeah yeah yeah we do it's so weird it's weird you know it's weird when I used to do radio you would go to and you talk to a guy and they would be normal like hey man where you from Boston oh cool cool cool alright so I'm just gonna do weather and traffic dude that's actually so fucking stupid it's those guys are all and those guys are always like you know when you would come up doing the clubs and shit and like you'd go on the road and then like you would do like the six o'clock morning news and those guys would I always describe those guys as like you can hear their face do not I mean like they'll be like so a we're talking about so you know you go to Atlanta you know you do that a prep so so what's that like for you and then they lean in and you're like this guy's face fucking makes noise it's the weirdest thing and you don't know unless you've been there but dude their faces are loud and shit like that you can see the cracks behind their face of their real who they really are when you're close you can't see on TV you just take newscaster for granted wonder who was the first guy that had the radio voice and then all the other people just started copying him like how did it become that voice I'm at first of the hour here on 106.5 and they do that they do that it's not W it's www and then upon another version that strip club DJ it's almost the same guy clothes variation to the stage we got champagne couple to the stage it's like a liger it's like a cross between a tiger and a lion the strip club DJ weather man it's gonna be raining and here comes fucking candy here comes Lexus to the main stage that's a weird cinderella just why yeah why can't it just be like all right here comes the fucking next dancer exotic please welcome exotica please welcome Pluto or my favorite Pluto is the fat one no it's the planet I know the planetoid the planet as a stripper comes Frankenstein stripper like this yeah maybe a stripper that's like really into monster movies yeah she gets on me I made up yeah oh that exists blood around the wrists stitches yeah it exists you think you just think of a new thing there's too many people out there and it's too late in the game yeah you can't you can't I posted on Instagram yesterday this gate winks for Trump oh that they had a party where they were trying to catch the co vid they had at Kovac and I said you know any time here this is what I wrote I wrote uh if you think you've seen it all yeah every day the internet will prove you're incorrect write first post Tony I had a blast caps but what's crazy is the comments where people were angry at me like for what really really really dumb Trump supporters right there is a spectrum of Trump supporters Trump supporters are very intelligent people that just like his economic policies and some people like Trump's my board that's my man right you don't nothing bad about Trump and those people I go I can't believe you sold out so what fake news like they were angry at me and what was their gripe that you know yeah when the rare times would I'd venture into the comments see what the fuck is going on oh man it's usually a disaster and I never do it but this is the problem with being home all the time I know all this extra time I find myself a ting pasta YUM I'm doing a lot of things I shouldn't do yeah whatever I read the comments on that one you gotta eat fucking pasta and reading but he confirmed to me that I shouldn't read comments I know I really shouldn't I'm definitely better at that than I was I used to I used to I used to have fun like talking shit to people I used to do it all the time and and and and then I was like my girl was like what are you doing you're gonna be fucking like 40 and like what is your kid you kids gonna see the shit and I'm like yeah you're right I should stop doing that and she's like by the way do you want to be fucking really famous or what and I was like I don't know what I didn't really think about it she's like fucking captain market doesn't do this shit and I said kind of right Captain America go back and forth the people on Twitter Chris Evans right I was just like yeah Twitter is hot right now there's so many people I mean hot in a bad way there's so many people angry because everyone's locked inside like Twitter is the place where you get the most it's the yeah I by the way I don't even go on Facebook so no that seems like a fucking cesspool that does but just do you have too much freedom to write long things on Facebook good point people are just too verbose there just is too much nonsense yeah like I'm not reading your novel yeah I'm not either man I'm not even gonna read your novel even if it's about me well III just but you get tweets and shit people are at least it's concise but people i-i-i don't ever when things something's gonna be offensive or now I was reading Marin's Twitter as meirin said it's okay to go for a drive right yeah and some lady like I wouldn't even tell you him and then she wrote a like all it all like 20 different hashtags hashtag covet 19 hashtag quarantine hat like trying to get so much attention that she's tweeting at market so mark went back with her and then she went back with mark and Mike get out yeah mark you need friends yeah go for that fucking Drive don't be arguing with this lady I know first of all you probably shouldn't go for a drive just to go for a drive but if you if people aren't doing it and the roads are dead it's I don't think it's that big a deal realistically now if you say that the problem is then a lot of people go do it right of course just go for a drive right so you can't really say that Anna so you shouldn't say I'm just gonna go for a drive just go for a fucking drive right and if you get pulled over by the fucking Gestapo yep you say I was headed out

and even have an assistant I know that's crazy to me I don't want one I think once you have an assistant you probably have made a mistake like you're you've you're doing too many things huh do less things yeah this some weird person who goes and does everything for I guess I mean yeah I guess I guess I understand fine is it four and then here here's your hotel resolution remember man I've walked your dog and I did - man I just want to be as normal as I can be interesting yeah I don't know how I feel about that do you have an assistant I don't good yeah I don't same boat yeah thinking about getting one huh well I've always liked I should I get one I'm putting pressure on you some people do first why don't you have an assistant al Madrigal has an assistant old al Madrigal I'll go do that shit he was yeah I go yeah do less shit just do that shit you don't have to you decide what you need to do right if you're doing so much that you need an assistant now you get to deal with this person what if that person has a like a kidney stone or they fucking lose their car that's funny yeah some new person you have to deal with their problems I had a real Hollywood moment once where we were like up fronts for Whitney the show that I did like fucking nine years ago and I found myself he's fucking weird Hollywood moments but I found myself at dinner sitting next to Vince Vaughn and he was like so you're on the show Whitney now so this is great no I was like yeah but he was like you made it this is awesome I mean I know you're comedian but now you have a show and I was like oh great and he was like we did it do you have an assistant and I was like no he's like you gotta get in a system buddy you made it and and I always think when getting a decision I think I always think back to Vince Vaughn's telling me I needed to get it insistent and I was like maybe I should get an assistant cause Vince Vaughn said it the invest one had a conversation once about business managers I pay all my own bills I don't yeah and I was like he was like 5% and I was like did I give him five percent so I'll have to think yeah I don't want to think about how to pay everything everybody a parking ticket he's paying off his own bill Vince Vaughn yeah well maybe just maybe he quit you think it was he was several years yeah this was more than a decade ago but I remember having this conversation with him like hmm yeah I would 95 that seems like if you had to look how much would you get paid an hour to do so yeah else's taxes and someone else's bills and someone else's not worth it especially he's making he's making shitloads yeah movie star yeah yeah I just watched him the other night and something I love it's fun oh dodgeball I watched made have you seen that movie made no it's like swingers and then they wanted to get the guys back together again as Jon Favreau directed it and it's Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn how many years later was everybody fat no not yet Road dare fucking that movie's hilarious he puffs that he's in it really yeah it's great he was Puff Daddy yeah are you allowed to call him by his dead name I don't know no you can't do that with transgender people you get kicked off Twitter for life I know call Caitlyn Jenner Bruce you'll get kicked off Twitter for life I saw that I think I saw a clip on your show it's fuck - Marc Maron if you wants to go for a drive though and all yes we're just tag it to the end of time put 20 hashtags up no one cares put a you know keep tweeting keep hashtag healthcare hashtag Obama has tagged first-responder hashtag Obama yeah Obama endorsed by Dhin I'm sold are you oh yeah he's fine now what's Obama endorsed him no he can't remember anything do you see what a Donald Trump jr. tweeted no already put it on Instagram that Biden is like a web browser it's no it's a hilarious mean the memes have just begun and here we are it's April but by the time November rolls wrong I don't the the the the that's debate what is his mind is like a web browser 19 tabs are open 17 or frozen he has no idea where the music is coming from he's posting this this world is just insane dude I I tweeted something I was like I don't know people gonna get pissed off at this or what but I tweeted oh great Burnie dropped out now the only thing that he's having is Trump and Biden need to drop out and and I was like I might get fucking shit for this but I didn't like it but I think as I hit everybody you know but like dude it was just like the fact that we have these options are just I don't know I'm a fucking idiot I'm not good politically but yeah I'm neither I'm not good politically either but it's just when you see I just the debate Trump versus Biden it's gonna be a mess we're just gonna be that what are they talking about Trump's press conference yesterday I strive watched a bunch of them and I'm like what am i doing like it's just he seems like the negative attention it just finally getting to him oh yeah I saw the clip where he was like you're nasty or whatever he was saying you're disgrace to the to the reporter yeah he was saying you're fake yeah he always says the ratings are down I know things are down you have no credibility yeah that's his his thing is always go after their ratings which is kind of fun it is funny too because he was tweeting about he was like I'm number one on Facebook yeah people reading that on their phone as are dying from Corona number one on Facebook what even is that number one on Facebook is like I have the coldest part of the ocean like what yes he said that his co vid 19 whose coronavirus reports had higher ratings on finale of The Bachelor that's so surreal just can't be real life it's so silly it can't be real life the one thing about Trump is whether you like him or not he is funny oh he's a lair he is funny he's hilarious he's a funny guy he might not be fit to be President you might be one of those you know but who is among you but forget it whether you think he's fit to be President or not fit to be President if you deny the fact he's funny we have a problem yeah that's that's that's that's that's where I'm at we can argue whether or not he's doing a good job anomaly or a bad job so try but guess what yeah he's full of laughs that fucking time that he was talking about buying Greenland he probably goes I promised not to do this he had a photo of a huge Trump Tower in the middle agreement I didn't see that it's literally that's funny it's laughed you out I was dying when he was like wait did you see the press conference where he was doing it was like yeah they said I didn't do a good job but I did a good job and this is the proof and he shows this little piece of apron he goes like this so you know that they were lying and he flicks the papers fucking lunatics lunatic it's not what you would expect right no I expect a person to be like Obama or like Clinton or whoever to be presidential like Bush you don't expect that what I thought but that's what I thought Bush was I thought Bush was the guy that everyone was like finally a regular guy like me a regular guy and I was like okay it'll be a while till that happens again yeah and it came back I mean Trump's like he's like the guy in your family were like oh he's coming to Thanksgiving like this motherfuckers gonna be talking the whole time and then you find out he's president is Greenland I promise not to do this degree let just one gigantic Trump Tower this is Trump in the middle of Greenland with the explanation excellent exclamation point yes come on that's fucking funny that's funny he like retweets memes and shit weird but also like look at the doctor behind him with the shot with the shawl just when he does it just like what is happening look at look at why am i okay oh so fun she's got the same look like as if someone farted and she's not gonna say anything but she smells it really felt good she does and she's always wearing that those capes she does wear a lot of capes yeah and what is that about being older that's a great line New York City to respect me I was Callen is if she'd be on his way yeah he's on his way he's get here this fucking guy now I know when he said like we set it up for him to get tested to when he said yeah yeah yeah I think I could be there what does that mean are you coming or not I think so like though like you do by the way nobody has shit to do right now yeah I said to do he was driving didn't know wherever the fuck was he driving where is he driving if he's not doing a podcast today he doesn't have shit to do and I don't think he's doing a podcast today he's got I mean parkus does he have not one to get a tea podcast yeah there was a time we had a lot yeah we had we had like a lot and like the one of them was like the intellectual one and I was like a mail drop that one yeah what they call it um mixed mental or that's it next mental arts how many episodes however many episodes are were they were that was that many to MIT that that to many that many to many conversations weren't bad but the title had to go I don't know I never possible yeah impossible you can't do mixed mental arts yeah something like that it might have been worse than that I might be blacking out I think it was that that's over he's the only guy I know with a TV show that's hoping it gets canceled so funny he's like I can't do this I don't wanna do this anymore I'm like I told you he sent me a video a few weeks ago and he was like work my whole life as an actor he had on like a fucking Iron Man thing and had like a thing that was blinking and because he was dressed for the scene and he was like this is my life man and it was a rotten MC if I got fucking final he was like he hates it like it's so boring he was the people are great I love working with these people the thing is boring and it takes so much time I'd rather just do stand-up the thing is is just here it is give it your air drop on I can send it to you so you can play who knows it what he says if it's okay I can cut it out if it's bad well is he saying something bad I don't think it some trouble for I don't think so um air drop young Jamie's here we go representative both of them yet but he is a fucking he's hysterical man I don't know anyone like him dude he is the only at one time this is this is how he is just so you know everybody who's listening when one of our best friends yeah right sure we talk a lot of shit cuz it's fun but he said he'd be there in 20 minutes great we were at dinner with the friends

I'm pissed I'm like these motherfuckers wanted to why would you do this they wanted to see me they'd never seen me do stand-up like it's fun for me like it's fun for me to do it for them it's fun for them to see and I call Brian I'm ready to get heated at him just be like what this motherfucker had a set at The Improv ain't even fucking mad she probably forgot and they were like where are you he's like come on to the improv right so he stole the time from me right so I go and I'm heated I'm gonna yell at him right and he picks up the phone and before I can even talk he says you ruined the night and I said what NEMA said we're at the fucking improv dude come on over and I was like you motherfucker and he was like nah they don't want to watch you they're gonna watch me I'm respected do you know what I mean well that's a good approach if you're gonna do something like that just go on the offensive right away it's a great yeah you don't want to be oh yeah whoops you gotta love a man yeah you gotta love him that guy is just a mile a minute and he is insane he's he's way more calm now than when he was younger when he was like thirty years old couldn't imagine he would you know he's had these girls that were useless they were they were like runaways and they were stealing from him they were they would stay in his house it was like some new girl stay in his house like what are you doing what are you doing I was always a mess so one time I remember he came over my house and we're gonna have dinner and we're gonna watch something like a fight there's something he came out my house he was over my house for ten minutes and he goes I got a party I have to go to but I'll be back I'm like what are you doing you came over for ten minutes did you tell two different people that you're going over your house of course he did I might've I go we'll just tell them to go fuck off yeah but it was like I think it was like something where it was like some producer guy who was hoping was gonna like put him in something and I'm sure he was literally over my house for 10 minutes unbelievable this fucking guy pray this plate look at look at him you know it's like pauses you know he looks like who's that old Ian McLellan from the x-men we played Magnus yeah you forget get a photo of Ian McClellan as magneto that's out of the way how does he look gayer than Ian McKellen in the fucking thing does Legare he lives he kill it's gay isn't he he's real good and he's real old and Brian looks older and gay Jimmy I need an image quickly [Laughter] that's Callen that's younger straighter Talent yeah it's younger and less gay look at that go back to thank you 10 minutes he gets here that's the look of please this I want to be able to pull it up immediately and just say Karen guess what we were talking about I love fucking making fun of friends or some shit the lighting it's working on the set make some old god thing about like like I you know I've gotten to do some cool shit like I you know I was on that show you that I really like and like you know I was on three episodes of that was that you know the show you know what is it oh it was like it's like the stalker show on Netflix we're like the guy stalks the girl and you're rooting for him somehow and he's like yeah it's really interesting the way they do it it's very good it's really fucking bin jabal like it's like one of those oh the next episode and I had watched the first season and it was a huge hit on Netflix it was on the Lifetime network it wasn't a hit Netflix bought it and then it would just blew up I watched the first season and I liked it and then this part came up for me to do in the second season and I was like oh yeah I want to do it because I like the show and it's drama you know I'm not you know because the best version for me comedic Lee is to do my fucking stand-up I'm not I want to be in you know these cards that come out cares whatever I was like it's interesting to me yeah I want to do it and I did it and I played the kind of like nemesis for the main guy for the first few episodes and um it was uh it was it was cool but it was drama so you're not like laughing all day like I'm tied up to a chair I'm fucking I'm doing these kinds of roles where I'm like fighting and shitting and it's it's it's boring do you know what I mean like you're waiting for this shit here we go either the same thing nine times hurry up and wait yeah perfect and then we are doing it you doing the same thing nine times and it's a drama and I like the project and it was great to do and I'm happy I did it and the show's great I love the show but the actual experience if I'm being honest to do these like thinking about the revenant like that saying that was fun has to be the wrong word it's fulfilling Shore rewarding rewarding great yeah but it's not fun to be in that will make up the function like the way you do your podcast you you just rant so it's like in the moment right then the way you do stand-up you're on stage it's live right it's all in the moment totally there's that preparation all for the premiere they're all just waiting here yes great there's six months of my life yeah now I wait to see what I'm doing next and let's start doing the new thing or at Christ I know and if you have one when it sucks like I was talking Downey right after do love that bomb yeah I guess and the critics one after mom it's good for a nine you're sure it's just so hard to break through yeah anyway it's fucking it's not the best movie that's the reality on it and the guy came off of the Avengers which is like whatever yeah and he is our man like you can have a bunch of different spider-man's you could replace the Incredible Hulk yeah he's Iron Man you try to have some new Iron Man people can we get the fuck out of here though that's not what I saw a clip of you maybe if you went real young the beginning of Iron Man and he was like twenty a man was never young yeah in the comics when the comic-book he was an older guy was a genius um I saw clip where you were talking to him I loved him and and he was saying and you were like it would be so you were saying nobody else could be Iron Man you got to be Iron Man if they ever come back you got to do it and he was like maybe I will maybe I won't he was like and you said it would be so awesome if you came back and you said it would be also awesome if you never came back like you know I mean and I was like that's that's that's fucking I thought it was interesting because it's like yeah I wouldn't fucking you wouldn't want to see so because he is Iron Man right but you wouldn't want to see him had anyone else to it but him hanging it up after that is the shit yes some things go bad you don't reduce to be awesome like Star Wars like I was reading this thing when this girl was who plays one of the people in Star Wars huh was bummed out at how bad the movie was received and she's like I had such an amazing time doing the film and I really loved it and then people just shit all over it right and I was like well yeah that's that's what you do right you put something out doesn't just cuz you enjoy doing it doesn't mean people gonna like it so if you're like if you're Harrison Ford right who spoiler got killed he might have got out right in time yeah yeah before those things went totally sideways it's just like a show that's like by Breaking Bad I had never seen Breaking Bad ever and I'm on season five now there's a quarantine I'm like great you know I'm watching the show it ends after five seasons dude if a show goes beyond five seasons it's really hard to maintain real hard I mean like I was i watch Dexter after four seasons I thought the first four seasons were fucking amazing after the John Lithgow season I was just like all right I lost it at the John let's go yeah the John Lithgow I was like it's just like he would have been caught he was just fucking you know I mean it's like yeah there was also like there's a terrible scene where he's choking some girl in a bathtub and like yeah it's fake stupid rear naked one no it was a really good joke oh it was and then he cut her leg in the bath I'm like this is it she's not even fighting this is not people who fight you like a wild animal you wouldn't hold on to somebody like that it's just you can't do a show for like looking dead that's it great for three seasons it was fucking that second season was amazing great but then it's like okay I got to a certain point like this is a fucking terrible show yeah but but and it's not even it's not even the show's fault it's the fans fault you keep watching the shit it's like you can't make a show good for 13 seasons and unless you have like 50 people that are writing it and a hundred and eighty people that are working on the set all those people have jobs you wanted to stay employed so everybody keeps going and if you quit then everyone's gonna be mad at you yeah yeah your heart's not in it anymore I mean like you know Sopranos was I think six seasons I think that's the most you can go maybe yeah lost lost was another one by the time I was over I was like what is this shitty show right they used to be amazing people forgot about lost lost was a fucking amazing show yeah I saw the first few seasons and it was just you know that show got lost I think that uh that because it was it didn't come out it came up before the streaming shit you know I mean once this if that came out like a few years later it would have been people would still be talking about it I feel like people don't because JJ Abrams became such a big deal and now they talk about him doing other shit which is a forgot about it there's just too many the thing about shows is now unlike back in the day you can access all of them so it's not like if you wanted to watch Starsky and Hutch 20 years ago like locked right where you gonna find it right right is there a DVD if stars kind of forgot about that you can't watch you couldn't watch you couldn't watch it so once a show was off the air it was just off the air yeah but now they just pile up I know they just keep piling up he's no way you can watch Handmaid's Tale and Ozark and stranger thing that's why I give up you got to be okay with giving up like if it shows not your bag you got to give up like like Game of Thrones I watched it for 4cs I know you love that fuck I'll show you I know but I just you know what it's not my style of show man why are you saying I mean awesome no it is awesome no it is awesome but it's only awesome it's like Breaking Bad the reason why I love Breaking Bad the reason why Sopranos I love it so much is because there's fucking humor in it man there's humor in times there is zero humor in Game of Thrones true and I get that that's a style but I just can't be sucked into something four five six seasons where nobody trips where nobody is just like awkward at a table and they're just talking about dragons in the most serious fucking way yeah but there's real dragons back then I know there were real dragons back then but still problems there real problems people were like and I'm not waiting and I'm not saying the show's not great it's absolutely great and I could never fucking put that show together in my life it's all it's awesome but it's just awesome all the time and I need a break from it some need humor I and I don't need something to be rip-roaring ly funny the whole time as a matter of fact I don't want it to be what was so funny the whole time sometimes funny yeah sometimes when you watch Ozark Ozark the first season I saw it was killer loved it did you give up after the first year yes because it was mostly only awesome the only humor that ever came is because Jason Bateman is humorous yeah wasn't a human wasn't a humor it wasn't like yeah but it's so good the only time I can be involved in a fucking movie or something with zero humor is if it's with like Liam Neeson in it and he's just kicking ass the whole time until the end see I feel like he's got brittle bones he's too old I don't buy him with all these face punches and something guys gonna break his hand I just taken is the shit to me but yeah of course he's gonna have to why I'm like you ain't kicking everybody's ass I know but also he watching show with dragons in it yeah but what's it this is more gonna punch somebody they're gonna duck catch them on the for his hands shatter it's gonna blow up like a balloon that's what I know yeah yeah I know that yeah when a show tries to be a little bit too much the realness of it you're like okay it's not real anyway so just that's what I'm saying I'd rather watch outbreak then fucking contagion mmm-hmm because it's like especially now I watch outbreak the other night and it was like and you were like we talked about this before parkas and you were like how now and I was like yeah because it's still it's kind of silly but contagion I can't do I heard contagions almost perfect but then like that's how these things break out no it's great it's a great movie but there's a game that you can play like a virus end of the world I forget what it's called maybe it's pandemic I forget what the name of the game is but my kids were playing it long before all this shit was going on and what's crazy is the way this game works if you have a gif you have a virus that kills people quickly it doesn't spread I was just saying this on my podcast because the but it's in the virus best interest is read slower yeah so it's hits more people that's why this one's so crazy because not only does it spread yeah but it spreads through a bunch of people that don't even show sympathy no it's slow because it wants to survive that's fucking creepy this is a weirdest fucking virus ever it's creepy it's so weird because I've never even heard of something where people so many people test positive and nothing happens to them weird but some people are dead I know I mean we've lost a lot of like really cool interesting people are gone because of this virus and then other people are just shaking it off like George Stephanopoulos nothing oh I didn't know you had it yeah his wife's got it real bad I did a TV show his wife way back in the day and she apparently has it bad body aches and pains and Ali Wentworth she's cool as fuck but she's really hilarious - so she's got it really bad and he's how old are they um I don't know she's probably like how old is she he doesn't even have any symptoms he said he doesn't feel anything he tested positive and she's really struggling that Chris Cuomo guy he's got it and he's like a mild fever at night he says it gets bad yeah no fever but yeah I mean how much different do you think it would have been if Tom Hanks died we'd have been rough but but people only reason would have been a lot scared oh yeah or Rita Wilson yeah you know if his wife oh she she lived and he died Oh Bill Withers didn't die from it right he died from something else right didn't have a heart condition yeah yeah I don't think it died from Cove it so he just died in the middle of it all so that got from center and live died who somebody a yeah yeah yeah that they all loved so sad man a lot of people gone man a lot of people gone this is like I said it is a weird virus where it doesn't necessarily really make sense where some people get it and it's devastating and other people get it and it's it's just does nothing weird oh my but my parents are fucking 72 71 70 71 to be to my three parents no I don't know but at 72 so I got eight parents my mom my dad uh my other dad and no and you know you got to think about like yo just at home my mom's 73 same deal you know they're they're worried about it if you had you young yeah yeah she had me when she was 21 nice it's some one of those things where you know when you're older and you see the news like the the percentage of people that are like above 80 that get it that survived I mean it's still like yeah it's still well yeah it's still like 90% naked right I don't know for your fucking parents like that yeah my parents are healthy they take care of themselves but fuck man yeah and he looked 30 year olds died people young people died I was reading about this this woman she lost her husband and her 20 year old son no so yeah yeah nothing worse they don't know why though this is the things like they're in the middle of gathering data and trying to figure it out so they don't know like what's causing some people to have this spectacular reaction to it will they die horribly and other people it just bounces off the old the blood type thing about how he did yeah I don't know if that's any yeah I don't know it just seems to me that there's a lot to learn about this disease they don't really know the really scary shit that I've been reading is I was reading something Jamie what's that article that I sent you today where they're they're thinking that it's possible that this this that they're saying that this was that it's the same this area okay what is this this website is reloaded okay this is in the Daily Mail so it might be a horse shit the Wuhan lab performing coronavirus experiments on bats from the caves where the disease is believed to have originated with a three million pound grant from the u.s. AdBlocker huh see The Daily Mail's at least kind of full of shit or sensationalized see if that's someone's writing that that's from a page but here's the thing what fucking paper can you really 100% believe today I don't have a paper that you go I used to do I don't know who to go to well the New York Times for me is still my number one choice yeah I mean I well just looking at the news to like I don't know what to watch either like if I keep it on you know now I go back and forth I literally go from the extremes I go to CNN and then I'll do Fox News because I want to fucking at least see what that both of them are saying yeah see this I don't like this with their say according to one unverified claim scientists the Institute could have become infected after being sprayed with blood containing the virus and then passed it on to the local community it sounds like a movie it does well I mean everything sounds like a fucking movie now yeah this shit our world is a movie right now have you seen that uh great job the cartoon the American president what the hell's a cartoon called and Showtime it's really funny no is it a trumpet about Trump yeah it's him the guy who does it sounds just like it's really funny no I've never heard of it yeah it's it's there's too many things to why I know I know that God you got your shit going on man no you know just do it yourself oh my god I can't believe when I started a podcast podcast like I was I was like I guess I'll try it and I'm like oh this is the best yeah you know no one can tell you what to do here is oh yeah the cartoon president is what our cartoon president's funny man I was 2018 it's been yeah two to three years yeah this has been going on for two years yeah how do I not know this there's too much to pay for bear show [Laughter] no one trolls Trump part of that Colbert now look at look at look at her did you see Trump announced like his team that he put together to start the economy again one of the people on his only seven people on the team one of them is his daughter and one of them is her husband he doesn't give a fuck dude I think they backed off of that later later in the day yesterday with him and

well you have barely any hair and you career no no listen I have a lot of TV shows going what's the deal with it what's the deal what bonk are you oh I didn't realize you're playing a ball guy in school not I have a hiatus right now the shows I might get into might be forever Kristen I might be doing some more shows shows it is crazy but it is possible you know we were been talking about like when do you get back to doing live shows and there's people that are thinking that it's not gonna be until 2021 like like the fall of 2021 because we're people it's gonna be a disaster and there's gonna be a lot of people that don't want to take vaccines there's a fucking meme going around things I would trust before I would trust Bill Gates vaccine yeah and it's like there's a there's a series of them you mean the guy who likes babysitting and there's a bunch of different like Bill Cosby's cocktail that's Russian BOTS I mean a Russian brandy coat or tweeted it he put it on his Instagram today have you seen it Jamie no they are just remember though when they were locking the shit down and they were like yeah big groups that people can't gather and so Joe and I had to cancel our tour and then they were like now ten people can't get together and you were like fuck I guess I can't do shows I'm sorry no because they were saying the thing about how things I trust more than the vaccine from Bill Gates caste shit sushi that's very good top right is hilarious wins tap water from Michigan a daycare run by Casey Anthony I said I said because we did that funny grunting name-dropping we have a time sure I loved his calves he's the best he's got the biggest calves in the world oh my god and and he he could carry all of us he could feed us for a week with one of his back to talk about male anatomy no is he saying and he said I said oh well me and Brandon are gonna do a sketch another sketch show a 3d fighter in kid 3d I want to put you know and then cuz I see your face got hungry I love doing secret shows that nobody sees so he goes the Internet's a sketch we don't need any sketch shows anymore and I was like fuck yeah well what I'm worried about legitimately worried about is two things one this thing morphing there was an article that I just sent Jamie earlier about India where they're saying that the vaccine won't work on the new strain of rotavirus it's mutated in India India has its own version of it yeah so these doctors are scrambling to try to keep up with these mutations and figure out what though taking you a weaker version but does the flu mutate every year yes and then there's vaccines for flus yes so hopefully they'll be better right and the next flu could be like the fucking h1n1 that kills like 40% of people it morphs into a weaker so AIDS has had to compromise itself so often with these protease inhibitors that actually now they think when you contact AIDS it's something that incubates and you can just have without taking any drugs in some cases so they've got weaker because it got weaker so the virus can be weaker typically as if viruses I can say this story but typically I think viruses get weaker as they are as the same you to disseminate into the population yeah my guess you with is that we develop resistance you would know you run Veronica's closet you were on that fucking show no I wasn't on that show no I was you played the ball guy I was on Sex in the City yeah you aren't Reba we should watch my reel laughter that's the ball game dude Sex in the City you weren't sex of the city people send me all the time shit about you fucking the girls look what the fuck us may have to keep social distancing until 2022 scientists predict want to hear your predictions bro I just it's not about the fatality this shit so how are they not wrong about that that's not that's not a feasible solution either here we go dude listen you catch it your constitution is mmm you've never you never in the Sun right so no yeah are you do would you Blanche dude there's no I jump duck I'm Italian oh you have Irish that's where but where do you get the Albanian no I'm not Albanian and there's nothing wrong with that but I'm not no I'm Italian no I'm not saying that but I'm saying where would you what are you what s Nick group do you think that you closely if you were to play a carrot yeah Jeff decides what Japanese I would love to play a Japanese guy that's why you can't do that I know I would love to do that but I wouldn't even do an accent and I wouldn't even like I would just be kind of a little bit Japanese about no makeup do you don't think you'd look you could say they do take in for mm-hmm you'd play one of the sex traffickers than that right I would love to do that to be need to do an accent yeah way to say I don't know you're barking up a wrong she you know 2022 is not good I don't like that the sound of that that's 20 22 that's bad what no more we were supposed to do that thing with Chappelle yeah well we reschedule that shit time right now hopefully how are we gonna do how are we gonna I don't see that being feasible I just I think they just test people well that is right but then Trump said that there's no way Americans all Americans are gonna get tests well I mean I don't know if you want to get tested you can get tested like Brian's gonna get tested and an hour from now it's fucking easy they test your blood I think it costs 200 bucks they fight you find out right away BAM 15 minutes later you go yeah or in your case fuck yeah Brian I don't have $200 - yeah I don't know testing all my guests you sure anybody that comes in here come in here 15 minutes for the show test your blood get in here it's a good I hugged him I hugged him we first got a touched anybody in for as soon as you test a possible adheres my thing about that statistically aren't we all pretty much guaranteed to catch it and not die well yeah just some people know you know the thing about it is you really can't judge this like any other virus because it seems to affect people very differently we were talking about George Stephanopoulos has it and he has no symptoms his wife has it she's being devastated by it she's sicker than she's ever been in her life Wow so it doesn't make any sense yeah it's it's people that are healthy and young get it and they're on ventilators people who are old get it nothing happens and then some people just die and some people don't even know they have it they say as many as 70% of the people that have it have no symptoms at all he's amazing they don't understand it okay so let me play devil's advocate without with all due respect to the people who perished and all that is when you have a disease like that and it isn't it the whole it doesn't it make more sense to quarantine in a targeted way don't we get people who are old and infirm with underlying conditions can't we target but then again is that is that reasonable because in Italy three generations live in the same house right right so that's why it was so devastating to the old there well places like you know your grandparents what are you supposed to do that's a real issue would you have to be very responsible if you live in with your grandparents you can't be out but you can't you can't say it you bomb you can't say hey some of you quarantine then it's just gonna keep the VARs are gonna keep going I've got to say people that are actually very at risk but people who I get it I get what you're saying you know well what I'm hoping is they can come up with antibodies and they can get the antibodies in people before they have an immunity to it before they have rather a vaccine for it yeah so it should sell your blood yeah when people have antibodies like Tom Hanks I know he donated his blood a lot of people don't in their blood don't get some of that I also think that people have to take their fucking immune system very very seriously people take their health care plan seriously they take their 401k plan seriously their car insurance seriously take your fucking personal immunity your physical body take care of that shit man and most people don't there's a lot of people there just eating sugar and smoking cigarettes and Jimmy Burke who the saint that he is Jimmy Burke is this is what he does in New York this guy he's on his bike free of charge and he delivers food to the poor and the old and the people who can't you know and he's usually up in poor areas of New York and one of the frustrating things he gets a list from that family and he has to go buy what they want and he said he goes it's so frustrating to me because they're there they're very poor but they're asking for the worst food pop-tarts donuts soda it's nothing that's a substance he's like I just wanna whatever time I drop it off I want to be like I can teach you a little bit about nutrition you'll be a little healthier and a lot of times really overweight diabetes is such a problem and say like in Spanish Harlem it's such a problem it's epidemic well they said one of the things they're finding in New York City is the number one factor for having a disastrous result is over being overweight yes like the smoking in China this is our version you shred it like me you're probably not gonna feel people were overweight or getting fucking destroyed by this disease yeah and that's tough man yeah obesity is what's the number one factor in New York City but I think cigarette smoking got to be high on that well yeah I mean yeah when you have a cardiovascular disease anything that's going to my lungs respiratory yeah damn this is so scary yeah it was a lot more fun before you got here we were talking ourselves we're talking about and you're just talking about like more like damn I feel weird because you don't have headphones on it we do like you're not one of us sorry why do you not have the headphones on I don't sit on my face they make your ears yeah they make you look you look hot to be honest you have a small head I guess why I haven't no no and so one thing I won't take no it's fine or something no what no hey the internet wouldn't call you pinhead they don't I call you pinhead guy sure stop saying kill people Wharton's you with your head like 8% head down Hey so small head Brian see see you're saying that now of course it's gonna catch fire now be careful no I I'm telling people on the Internet please don't call Brian small head bride right I don't want them to because I'm talking and you interrupted right so we can all agree on that so you made a mistake and that's fine right but but the reason why it's okay that you have a small head yeah because you you have a small body as well I have brought you soul although your head look small for your body it leaves your body still on the small side but it's not small enough to make your head look proportionate look at me look at me you line up a hundred supports a B 1099 right I would lose to him in in something that required if you said well being a contortionist you know you got to be bendy and that's a sport he can't move his body you your very man he can't leave his body they don't say they go like this when they I used to think my name was he can move his body what the fuck people beats the point and look at me I'm like man Chris you're bendy because you don't have you don't stand for anything would you be interested in having a competition with him and some sort of sport yeah but he would lose we already tried we do whatever would you try it oh my god he can't singing he has no wind I got wind growin bro I got no wind you got you broken you should see me do it I do see you could hold a note no longer yeah okay cool I mean I beat him by I mean it was embarrassed okay fine you beat him by anyway this was a while but my note was way better no no see your shit is fucked sound like a singer you can sing I saw when you were washing your hands you were saying yeah like an opera singer I stopped guys Josh Groban saw me oh yeah he's got he sings weird stuff like old timey yeah yeah a young guy who would sing Duncan that's like some Harry Connick jr. type shit yeah but new yeah yeah he's a funny dude if you've met him no Josh mom is a good guy funny guy yeah great sense of humor I believe you yeah you have to put yeah dude what's the deal man on the Internet dude the people on the internet don't say that Bryan Callen is the biggest Josh Groban fan don't do that and don't say he has a small head hey you might be Josh Groban I think a lot of young I think a lot of girls like him of course he's handsome right he's cute he's a cutie pie was that mean he's got chris d'elia hair little thicker and with depth - he's thicker than me no no his hair well that's well no no okay dude up 40 I made it bro now you have he dodged the bullet thank you awesome no little darker than normal so so somebody is using what no I don't fuck that at every dyeing your head no I can't wait to be a silver fox dude and she's gonna be one are you saying that he like purposely died some of the hairs yeah you might be taking some mascara to his beard okay there's a weird thing when you see a guy and all of a sudden this beard is dark yeah hey yeah that's the thing it's like we get we know you dude yeah we've seen you before what are you doing New York art history white and now it's black

question why you did a deer that got hit by a phone oh no no no no but what I mean isn't you were and what have you since then what happened since then okay listen I'll grant that you are the Taylor Swift of comedy all right just right you're not Led Zepplin you're an old guy why would you even bring up Led Zep all due respect to Taylor Swift who I like back you said someone was gonna film specials again when is that gonna I'm just so glad my dad came out you you nailed it I nailed it luckily yeah like I was saying with Louie Louie CK filmed his under the wire look right there cuz he filmed his like in March yeah he filmed it March it was like March 6th or 7th and he just put it out I don't know man am I not optimistic man doesn't look good man shop has a date for the end of June in Spokane Washington is crazy and I said that's very optimistic oh just a date not that special yes one thing is that Washington State they got hit early so they might open up quicker I hope so isn't there a coordinated effort among governor's to slowly open this whole thing up right I don't know if they know what to do because no one's ever done it before so it's one of those things where we're going to watch one state do it and fuck up and then we're going okay let's not do it the way North Dakota did it let's try to do with the way Arizona did it and then your question is like something like Disney World how do you open Disneyland is how do you do that watch so it's a good court if somebody catches kovin when they're there Mickey Mickey with a mask on yes a mask boys do you signs you son huh ears around this big year that's gonna be a new Disney character kovat Mickey he warned that California should prepare to enter a radically different realm where residents continue to wear masks and where they will be greeted at restaurants by waiters wearing masks and gloves with disposable menus in venues that have half as many tables jesus fucking christ for the governors this is from gavin newsom told reporters to check back with him in two weeks when he may be able to outline exact dates of California cz flattening and then decline of Corona vias core virus hospitalization range he's dealing with the worst case scenario that I and I I think that all of them are around yeah I just think we're gonna I think human beings adapt I really do I think I think that's not gonna be the case I think after a while people are gonna be like fuck it well waiters with masks on it's gonna be strange there's gonna be a lot of opportunists that cause crime because a lot of wearing masks it's very very different world my man I've where Richard Nixon mask anyway that's the mask I used to see yeah well just put a Richard Nixon mask yes president it's like a Point Blank Point Break yes Point Break do a new version of that work yep yeah oh I saw it how bad was it I love the original dude it's like everything that was special about it's a same thing with the Total Recall movie and I love Colin Farrell I think he's great but they did that it's like they just took everything that was special about the fucking movie and they just made it a straight action movie they shouldn't do that anymore one of the money's why do they redo movies just make a new movie what is the best movie you've seen in a while in the past year into the spider-verse have you seen that it's a it's really great it's amazing it's a great animated spider-man movie but it's what awards and shit I think it's the animation spectacular it's really fucking good the plot is great it's a great movie I was a little skeptical Mike amount of cartoons spider-man movie with a pig there's a pig in it like this is it's you haven't read this it's great it's fucking great the book about the movie yeah I'm a reader no it's it's like it's cartoonish but it's not the animation is amazing it's like it's really good man I was blown away I'd heard it was good so I was like I heard was good and we do movie night with my kids so we decided to sit down and watch and it was fucking amazing blew me away I watched a quiet place again good fucking movies really good but why didn't they just turn everything all up well why did they just turn everything all honesty and then the aliens would have heard everything and then everything would they wouldn't heard the people walking around mmm it was a great movie but why didn't they do that because the aliens would kill everything where there was sound how many aliens were there we don't know yeah but there's gonna be a second one coming out these movies daddy's Wonder Woman - that movie blood spot blood shot whatever with Vin Diesel that was gonna bomb anyway now at least I was an excuse do you know what I mean do you know what I mean because now
