Boop here we go hello Kyle hey man what's going on what's going on buddy good to see you again good to see you and your wonderful pink shirt yeah it's confident right pink and gray it's like you're confident you got a lot of shit going on yeah the lowdown on this though is uh I was supposed to get this dry-cleaned when I was in Tennessee for politican which was just a few days ago and then even when I got here I was like I gotta get this tri clean go on Rogan show of course I didn't but it doesn't look too wrinkly it looks good thanks man looks very good preciate it so tell me what you were saying right when I walked in I said hold this thought you were you were saying that Chelsea Manning is locked up and they're charging her a thousand dollars a day yeah Chelsea Manning is locked up right now because they wanted her to say more stuff against Julian Assange she's refusing to do it and they're finding her I think it's over $1,000 a day so that shows you you know cuz before that we were talking about Snowden yeah and that shows you that they do not mess around when they feel like you're uncovering their BS ya know what are they trying to get from Julia Assange like what do they have on him well Julian Assange there's a there's a couple reasons why they despise him but he has no political home right now particularly because it used to be Democrats that defended him right but then he pissed off the Democrats because he leaked on the DNC and he showed you know what was going on with Hillary behind the scenes and now the primary was basically rigged against Bernie Sanders so Democrats used to like him now Democrats hate him and Trump used to like him when he said when he was getting this information on Hillary but they hate him as well because Trump has basically been convinced by the people around him in the White House that this guy is dangerous because this guy basically exposed US war crimes that's why they're coming after him because he released a video which showed that we were killing civilians and then we circle back around and did what's called a double tap where we killed the first responders and the idea at the time was oh it's okay we're going after al-qaeda but come to find out that wasn't al-qaeda they were innocent civilians and then they were the medics that came afterwards and so Julian Assange thought hey listen this is not something we should be doing and the American people deserve to know about this this shouldn't be top-secret this is a war crime and so he released that and then that's why they were coming after him and throwing the book at him because you know just like with Mike Ravel previously Daniel Ellsberg actually is who I'm thinking of just like with Daniel Ellsberg when he showed the what we were doing in Vietnam and how we were killing civilians they do not want you to expose their war crimes they will throw the book at you and act like you're a spy you're working for a foreign country you're a traitor because they want to keep that stuff under wraps because it really embarrasses them and it really shows what US Empire is doing around the world that was that Collateral Murder video yes yeah what's really bizarre about this is how no one speaks out against it no one no one on the right no one on the left it's just this thing now yeah I don't I mean it's like it doesn't have a home yeah well unfortunately what you see is it becomes very partisan so when when Obama is doing drone strikes and killing 90% innocent people unfortunately partisan Democrats don't talk about it now that Trump has increased drone strikes by four hundred and thirty two percent over Obama with still a tremendously high civilian death rate now you know maybe some Democrats will talk about it but Republicans certainly don't talk about it but four hundred and thirty two hundred thirty two percent that's right and Obama was a radical acceleration of the Bush administration's drone policy that's right and Trump has increased it even more and see that's the problem is people get mad now that you know Trump is at the helm of this stuff but all of these things now it's precedent he's not doing anything that wasn't established beforehand it was two answers the one you say Trump is doing it who exact exactly making the call do they bring this call to trump and they say hey you know we're gonna bomb Yemen we're gonna do this with drones and this does he have to sign off on each individual attack that's a great question and the short answer is I don't know I wouldn't be surprised if Trump was directly involved in some of these instances I know that his first military raid is president that he approved ended up killing a nine year old American girl it was Anwar al-awlaki's daughter I believe and but I also do think that there is this what you can call the deep state I know people think that's like a conspiratorial term but it's really not all that saying is that the CIA the NSA the FBI these are people who are in these positions of power and they're there they're throughout all these different administrations yes Snowden talked about that exactly so that's not conspiratorial and so when when you have a kill list and when you have people at the CIA and the Pentagon by the way a lot of them are calling the shots and maybe they just need an okay every now and then from President Trump but yeah I mean I think that there's it's not just one person making all the decisions I think that the president does play a role but I also think it's generals I think it's people at the CIA and I think it's this complex web of people who are all kind of involved in this thing that ends up being drastically negative yeah drastically negative to put it mildly right when you're talking about 90% civilian casualties with drone strikes that's such a disturbing thing that this continues that no one says hey this is grossly ineffective and horrific in its consequences yeah what they do is you know they give everybody a false choice that make it seem like hey listen man if we're not doing these all-out ground invasions and we're not doing like war war with boots on the ground well what do you want us to do like there are bad people out there we got to go after these bad people so this is like the soft power option if you will and my response that has always been yeah but you do have to follow the Constitution and the way our system is supposed to work is you can't have the president just declare war and just go and do it Congress has to approve war so if you wanted to do a drone war okay but you got to get a declaration of war tell me exactly which countries you're gonna be doing the bombing in while you're doing the bombing in those countries and get an approval through Congress so if you were coming to me and say hey man there's an al-qaeda cell that's very active in Pakistan or whatever so we want to approve a drone war have Congress vote on it see what happens and then move from there but what we're doing now is it's just baked into the cake that we violate US law we violate the Constitution and we violate international law with all these bombings because as of right now we're bombing at least eight different countries and we also have a shadow war going on in Africa so this is we do absolutely the shadow war and effort so the intercept reported on this I don't know as much on this off the top of my head but if you wouldn't mind please pulling up an article from the intercept there's a shadow war going on in Africa where we're building military bases all over Africa and the idea is I think that we have these bases where we can the drones fly out of and they could go to the Middle East and they can bomb there is this also in response to the fact that China is essentially moving into large parts of Africa to extract minerals and see natural resources yes and this is actually super interesting because the China thing they're doing this belt and road initiative and basically this is like their version of empire through debt okay so what they do is they'll go into like they just made a deal with Iraq we spent trillions of dollars interact at an illegal and offensive war China swoops in and they go hey listen what we want to do is help you guys we want to build your infrastructure up we want to make your country beautiful so if you do a deal with us we're gonna like build all the infrastructure which do you credit exactly and then what happens they turn around and they say okay well then you can get a certain percentage of our oil sales or whatever it might be so this is and it's funny because there's been this like evolution when it comes to empires so it used to be back in the day you just kind of go up on somebody shores and say mine I'm taking it and you do it by force then the u.s. evolved from them what the u.s. does is it's this cute little trick where we say no no we're not going to control you directly what we will do is take somebody from your native land prop them up as a dictator and then they will allow us corporate interest to go in there and kind of exploit the natural resources but it's intelligent because you're saying no no we're not in there ourselves like the British did in India for example or they just showed up and they're like it's ours you know there was a British presence there very clearly we have people from their native lands take control but we exploit stuff from them and extract stuff from them so China took that one step further where it's like okay no we're actually gonna provide you with you know material well-being we're gonna give you a solid infrastructure and then it's like you look at it more like a business deal than an expansion of empire and honestly this is one of the weird benefits of having an authoritarian like system like China does is they can make a decision on a dime yeah you could just have the the Communist Party just goes yeah well we'll do this because this is the best way to do it and there can be no nobody can fire back and say I don't agree with that let's stop it here the way Western democracies work it's almost like you have this certain slowness that's built into the process because there's so many checks and balances and in many ways that's a good thing you want a system like that but in many ways it provides a strategic disadvantage at least when you're talking about imperialism so here's the article from the intercept US special operations numbers surge in Africa's shadow Wars the most dramatic growth in deployment of American elite troops of any region of the globe over the past decade according to newly released numbers Africa it says in 2006 just 1% of commandos sent overseas were deployed in the u.s. Africa Command area of operations in 2016-17 point to 6% of all Special Operations Forces Navy SEALs and Green Berets among them deployed abroad were sent to Africa so this is something like you never hear him ever hear about it never been a vote on it they just do it Wow it's scary it's scary the way that it works how you really do have a deep state if you will kind of making decisions and the president just kind of goes along with it and we're all sitting around here acting like hey man maybe instead of doing that we can actually I don't know use some of our tax dollars to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure which gets a grade of D plus I mean but I think doing it because they see a threat like exclusive USS mu has more military operations in Africa than the Middle East whoa now is this is it possible because they see a threat I think that's the rationalization that they use but I think it has more to do with power and control and when you're the world's sole superpower you don't want to cede that ground to anybody else right and so the benefits that come along with that in their mind is they can rationalize jacking natural resources from all over the world by saying no listen you'd rather have us in this position then you would Russia then you would China so it's really like this the idea is in their own minds it's like we're a benevolent superpower that's only doing this to keep the World Order when Mike Baker tried to explain wha wait to me and one of the things that he Mike Baker from the CIA and one of the things that he was explaining he said you have to realize that there is no such thing as industry independent of government in China if you have something like Huawei if you have a giant corporation they are inexorably connected to the Chinese government and the moves they make are not necessarily designed for you know the infinite growth paradigm this idea that we have in the United States with corporations are beholding the stockholders or just trying to make money that's not what they're doing over there they have a long game and the long game involves information involves espionage it involves stealing trade secrets and and patents from other companies and so when they're selling them these modems they've got built-in third-party options so the third party meaning China can extract information so if you're if someone has this modem and they're using this modem to send information to someone in Beirut China can also get that information yeah they do a lot of cyber I mean that that's the thing that's been known for a long time that they're they'll you know Jack patents and intellectual property and they have this whole you know economy that's kind of thriving off technology that's made elsewhere that's certainly an issue but also I would argue that is probably the case with the u.s. too that this kind of distinction between corporations in the state is largely a veneer because you have such control of our political process because of big money from corporations flowing into the system so I think that a lot of these decisions that are made even when it comes to foreign policy are directly in relation to how it will impact those corporations like the thing that I remember was a light bulb moment for me back in the day when I first learned about it was the banana wars have you ever heard about this no back in the day I think it was in the late 1800s but don't quote me on that we just went into South America and started toppling governments because we wanted to Jack their bananas and it was literally further I think the Chiquita banana company that we did that really yeah so when you look at that you go okay well that kind of distinction between corporation and government is not even really a thing here it's like this veneer that's in between the two but really it's the powerful moneyed interests and the elites that kind of run everything and they're they're married at the hip whether they're in the government or whether they're in corporations what year was this I think this was the late 1890s again I'm more than happy to be fact-checking on this but I remember the first time I read about this it had to be in college the banana Wars I was like that's insane for bananas it's crazy well how about when you go throughout history and you find out that a lot of the wars were over salt I didn't even know that I didn't know how they killed people for salt it was very important back in the day because they didn't have refrigerators so in order to preserve things to keep them from being infected by bacteria they would pour salt all over their meat and salt all of their fish and that's how they preserve things right you could apparently preserve things for long periods of times when you completely cover them with salt yeah so it's yes I guess it's just always been a thing that it's like wars over resources yes now there's a lot about oil but like we we're accustomed to the oil stuff yeah you're right we have been used that for quite a while and it's interesting because what just happened with Syria and Trump that was fascinating is he at first he said oh we're getting out of Syria were getting out of northern Syria everybody went crazy and said oh my god what about the Kurds and then we come to find out like three or four days later that he's like well no we're actually taking these troops from northern Syria moving them over into western Iraq and they're gonna be doing the same thing that they've been doing from Western Iraq and then Trump had the nerve to go out there and say and we've secured the oil that's so tremendous we've secured the oil we're not gonna make the same mistake like we made in Iraq again and this is something that he had been saying at CPAC the Conservative Political Action Conference going back for years every year he'd give a speech and he actually said like we should we should have taken the oil we should have taken the oil in Iraq because we didn't want Isis to have it and we should have it instead of Isis and it's like he's he actually rips the mask off of everything we're doing because he has no filter and it's like yeah that was a big part of it but what he's just admitting in front of the world is international law means nothing we don't care about you know the proper process we don't care about like imagine for a second China did that to us they're like no big deal or anything but we're just gonna go into Texas and we're just gonna Jack all your oil but don't worry because it's okay we're allowed to do that because we say we're allowed to do that we've like what are you talking about but we're gonna do that to a sovereign country Syria as we pretend like we care so deeply about civilian or that Syrian civilians and that's why we're there to protect them like know we're there check their oil that's what we're trying to do and control the region it's so disturbing when it's that transparent exactly but that's see that's it's interesting you said her well that's what I was just about to say next is that some people make the argument that well at least there's no tap dancing bullshit whereas with all all the other presidents they have this this like fake holier-than-thou attitude where they really can like put a happy face on a disgusting thing like Empire where Trump is and I think it's fair to say he's like too stupid to really go through the tap dance and so people are like hey there it is it's like it's right in front of our face but what's interesting about him is he says both things at the same time like he has the political instincts enough to know that people think war is generally bad so he always goes out there and he talks about how he thinks war is generally bad and we got to get our troops out of the Middle East I don't know why we're there so stupid to do in the first place but when you look at what he's actually doing it doesn't match his rhetoric so I don't know if you remember this but like a year or so ago he tweeted we're getting out of Afghanistan finally after all these years we've been there for 18 years it was terrible we should have never been in there in the first place and then we just didn't get out he said that acted like we were gonna do it and then the generals by the scenes were like that's a good one and we never got out and then he just stopped talking about it we're still there he just says it he's like we're gonna get out of Iraq then he doesn't do it so what happens is he gets it's actually politically it's it comes across sometimes as a positive because nobody follows up with it and the media doesn't do their job and say wait we didn't actually get out of there but so it comes across as a positive politically because he's still doing the head fakes towards non-intervention with people agree with but it's business as usual behind the scenes how much time do you think he actually spends on any of these things and if he does spend time how does he have the time to do these interviews how does he have the time to tweet how does he have the time to watch Fox News I mean I really want to know like how much interaction he actually has with his cabinet like how much interaction does he actually have with the generals how much interaction that's that's the dirty little secret Joe is that it can't be much it's not because what he really does is he watches Fox News all day and tweets out their videos and he tweets all day well how yeah right how many be doing that and then also doing what we think you should do look I don't have any time and all I do is do podcasts okay so I watch him and I'm like this doesn't make any fucking sense no so here's the thing and there was a story that was reported before he became president I think it was after he got the Republican nomination there was this interesting story that it wasn't discussed too much but I thought it was fascinating because the Trump team apparently approached John Kasich who's just like kind of a standard establishment Republican and he was the governor of maybe in Ohio but I'm not sure it was one of those states over there but anyway so he approached John Kasich and basically said to him boss behind the scenes hey listen man if I in this election I want you to kind of like be my vice president run the day-to-day at the White House take care dot all the i's cross all the t's do all the work like that and I want to go around the country and keep doing rallies and rile up everybody and get everybody to our side so basically and this shouldn't come as a surprise to anybody what's that well even if you win why do you have to rile everybody up well see he's the first president to never stop campaigning he's always campaigning he's always doing rallies and there's a reason why he's doing that Joe it's the only thing he loves on this earth it's that and watching Fox News that he loves so that's what he does with all of his time and everything else yes he's just see this is the thing Joe he took all these deeply establishment figures Steve minuchin of Goldman Sachs Stephen um forgetting his name Cohn something Cohn Cohen Cohen another guy from Goldman Sachs he had all these just career insiders brought them into his administration whether it's with the economy with foreign policy John Bolton deep neoconservative you said he he believed in the opposite philosophy but then but then he puts John Bolton to power because he wants the system to keep running as it is and run smoothly while he goes around and just you know makes the name for himself and talks about how amazing and tremendous this country is and what an amazing job we're doing so it's funny because he has two different personas one of them is I'm gonna pretend to be the anti-establishment guy and rally people up non-stop and be a politician and be good at it and then the other thing is behind the scenes he's like guys just keep everything running and and you know hold it together with duct tape if you have to before I get out of here so he's at the same time he's acting like the most anti-establishment president of all time when he's on the campaign trail he's also the most deeply Pro establishment candidate in terms of our president in terms of what he's actually doing so it's a fascinating dynamic that's going on right now it's a giant hustle that's right it's a giant hustle and listen man and other people on the Left might disagree with me on this but I think he's fuckin brilliant at it I think he's brilliant at this part of it but where he really does have a way like he broke every single political rule that ever existed when he ran for president and he won so what does that tell you that tells us like oh honey the problem is who is he running against I don't think that would have worked he was running against Obama I think Hillary's such a deeply flawed candidate and so many people despised her and during the me2 era right like her creepy fucking husband just looming in the distance like Nosferatu I mean how many women have come out and accused that guy of sexual assault and raping and he's still hovering I mean he's still around and that's always gonna haunt her she's connected to that guy forever on this topic there's an amazing story so during the election remember when the story broke of Trump on video saying I grabbed by the pussy I don't even wait and everybody blew up and all the mainstream media talking heads were like oh my god it's over he's gonna drop out it's over it's done right what did Trump do with that next debate this was actually low key political brilliance instead of doing what every other politician would have done which is basically kind of given a little bit and be like all right you got me what he did he leased a short apology video real quick out of the way then the next night was a debate at the debate Joe he brought like eight Bill Clinton accusers yeah put them in the audience yeah and then he goes out there on stage and when he's asked the question the first thing he says is listen I'm not proud of what I said it wasn't a good thing what I said but what I did was just words what Bill Clinton did was actions folks it was actions so if you want to see who the real problem is he's sitting right there in the audience and the brilliance of that move is this is politics 101 never really go on defense your best defense is a really good offense so he made it a wash all the sudden this issue which was supposed to be oh my god is the end of Donald Trump now the whole conversation shifted to I mean damn there are a lot of accusations against Bill aren't there so maybe this is a loss and we just kind of move on from this topic completely that's all he had to do yeah and you see with every single scandal the Trump's involved in you see how incredibly pathetic and ineffectual and weak the Democrats are at marketing and strategizing and you see how good he is because he is no matter what it is he's gonna flip it he's gonna flip it back on you so the new thing is the Ukraine thing I don't know how close you've been following this but the Ukraine thing he basically got caught on a phone call asking for dirt on his political opponents Jill Biden he was talking to the president of Ukraine and he said it in so many words I mean he likes say there was no quid pro quo but there doesn't have to be it's implied everybody knows what you're asking for you're asking for dirt on your political opponent somebody's melting down and going oh my god man you can't do that this is violating every violating every norm this is not something any president should be doing relying on a foreign power to get dirt on your political opponents what is Trump do again goes right back on the offense and he goes out there and says I have every right as president to investigate corruption and Joe Biden is incredibly corrupt and all I'm doing is I'm you know trying to figure out why was hunter Biden getting fifty thousand dollars from an energy company he doesn't know anything about energy why is he getting this and so now again the conversation isn't man--he Trump should have been doing that the conversation is okay sure maybe Trump shouldn't be doing that but goddamn Joe Biden's son and Joe Biden's family is really corrupt aren't they well how about the video where you you saw the video where Trump released it where it was Biden talking about yeah the loan mm-hmm like explain that okay so this one I'll give you what the Democrats saying I'll give you what the Republicans say the Democrats say hey man that's a misleading video because yes it's true Biden was holding a billion dollar subsidy over the head of Ukraine to fire a prosecutor but Biden wanted to get rid of the corrupt prosecutor and bring in a non corrupt prosecutor that's why he was doing what he did and holding that subsidy over their head and they say the prosecutor that eventually came into place actually investigated the Biden family more so that's why the Democrats say there's you know you're kind of misleading by putting this out there the argument that Trump is making is well know you're holding a billion dollar subsidy over the head of a foreign government and saying you have to listen to us and do X Y & Z that's problematic in and of itself yeah but furthermore it's like it's corruption anyway we know that the only reason hunter Biden was getting paid 50 thousand dollars a month and actually now people are saying it's not fifty thousand it's eighty three thousand dollars a month is because his last name is Biden and so it's pay to play corruption eighty three thousand dollars a month is a lot of fucking money and this is where I think like Democrats are silly because they always find the weakest anti Trump argument possible and now they're put in a position where they have to try to say like oh the Biden's did nothing wrong at all and Trump is all bad and bottom line nobody's gonna believe that the Biden's did nothing wrong when you're getting eighty three thousand dollars a month and you know anything about natural gas right what was the justification for the eighty three thousand dollars I don't even know what they give is the justification I mean the only thing I heard from I think it was Ted Lou was he's a you know Democratic congressman was you know hey man people sit on boards and there was nothing wrong there it's Israeli week but here's the thing and this is again why the Democrats tried me crazy is like they picked the weakest of all anti Trump arguments so they wanted to use this as like oh we're gonna try to impeach him over this and this is gonna be the thing that we're gonna hang our hat on and Nancy Pelosi even said we're gonna limit the scope of the impeachment investigation to only this only the Ukraine phone call and then somebody like me I'm sitting there I'm pulling my hair out because I could actually give you like three or four super legitimate things they're impeachment worthy not that I think it strategically makes sense and we can get into that if you want to but like the one that drives me crazy is Donald Trump has a hotel in Washington DC that he owns okay he took three hundred thousand dollars through that hotel from the Saudi government so they're funneling him money through his hotel in DC and then Donald Trump turns around and gives a multi-billion dollar weapons deal to the Saudi government as they're committing a genocide in Yemen we know they're committing a genocide in Yemen we know that we're arming them and he gave them even more weapons because he got that money through his hotel so for me I'm looking at that I'm going oh my god this scandal has everything it's got personal corruption it's got guns going to a vicious genocide 'el country what was the money for the money in the hotel okay so what they did is they had these like little retreats at the hotel and Saudi Arabia would pay for US veterans to go and stay at these hotels and they would I don't know if it's like tours of the capital or whatever it is but they pay for these veteran groups to go to the hotel but then of course you look at it and you go I don't know man three hundred thousand dollars and the speculation is well of course they overpaid on purpose but furthermore even if they didn't Jimmy Carter had to sell his peanut farm when he was president because the idea was hey we're not even saying you're doing anything corrupt but just the fact that you have this personal private business it is theoretically possible that foreign governments want to give you money through your peanut farm so you have to sell it because just the existence of it enough it is enough to say it violates the emoluments Clause of the Constitution which is just a fancy way of saying that the president can't be corrupt and take money from foreign governments and Trump is doing that he just is right so this $300,000 though this is for services rendered this is for hotel room well that's what they say is it's for I guess the meals and the hotel rooms and whatnot I hate to say it this way but that's not a lot of money to someone like them well you know but then what I always think about when people make that point is you have to flip it what would we be saying if it was the clinton foundation getting $300,000 from the saudi government and then Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State approving a weapons deal to Saudi Arabia and the fact of the matter is that actually is almost exactly like what happened with the Clinton Foundation because Bill Clinton was going around and giving speeches yeah at all these you know Gulf dictatorships and then that he was getting you know five hundred thousand bucks a pop or whatever was and then Hillary Clinton was approving weapons deals the Secretary of State so to see that I feel like that's a little bit more egregious because these speeches are worthless like at least the this hotel rooms it's like real it's real food he's meals like that actually cost money these speeches are worthless that's a in my opinion in my opinion those speeches are a transparent bribe so do you think though that a president should be able to have private businesses the foreign governments can pay him any amount of money no I don't think so I don't I don't sure but I just don't think they're comparable like I think with the Clinton Foundation I think the Clinton Foundation was egregiously gross right I think both of those things are egregiously gross and I don't think it influences him I think it's sure it sure influences them because there's a deal right they have a deal even if it's only $300,000 which I know most people hear this oh like that's a lot of money it's a lot of money to me but is it a lot of money to a billionaire I don't necessarily think it is and it's it's also a lot of money that goes through his organization and that it costs money to make that money so how much profit is that out of $300,000 is not that much profit with if $500,000 of speech that's one talk for one hour and it costs nothing for him and he's making a half a million dollars and he did it over and over and over and over and over again and it was all under this the guise of the Clinton Foundation is doing this great charitable work all across the country and all across the world and that to me was more transparently disgusting yeah so I understand I understand why you would say that but I also think that there's a problem with it in Prince yes I would just nip it in the bud no questions asked but beyond that there's also other stuff so I'm just giving you one example there's so there's the other thing which again very few people spoke about or recognized that during the campaign Donald Trump registered eight new businesses in Saudi Arabia so again when you're running for president it's you know you're it's a public service you're trying to serve your country right and you shouldn't intertwine business with that in any way shape or form there's another one I believe he has he has a hotel in in Turkey and now his argument by the way is no it's okay because I transferred all this to my kids so while I'm president my kids take run my businesses and take care of it but I think that's just a total nonsense Dodge because you're still your family is still profiting from it and here's a crazy fact Joe than this one would really just blew my mind with Trump in office in one year Jared and Ivanka made I think it was 82 or 83 million dollars in one year how through their businesses and they say oh there's nothing to see here there's no problem but then you dig into the specifics and yet again you see so many sketchy things like Jared Kushner got like millions of dollars from Israeli banks why and then this is the guy who they say it's okay he's gonna broker a peace deal between Israel and Palestine one of the sides is given a millions of dollars you think that's gonna be a fair pizu it's gonna be the most lopsided peace deal in history and this is the problem is that and again for the Trump example it's just that he kind of rips the mask off and shows you what everybody's doing but it's not like it didn't happen with Bill Clinton it's not like like with Barack Obama it was Wall Street appointed his entire administration I believe he got a list from Citigroup to you know put people in his cabinet and it's like this is the way the system functions and my opinion is it should you shouldn't be taking money from foreign governments you shouldn't be taking money from corporations because you're gonna be biased in favor of those countries and in favor like look at what happened with your market shogi and Trump I mean they killed a journalist they killed a journalist and they didn't even get a slap on the wrist it was nothing why again because we're so intertwined with them with business relations and he is making money from them and and where is that right now where's what did you mawkish you think yes as far as I know it's dead in the water that's crazy but this again look at the difference between how they talk about stuff like this when it's a US ally versus when it's not a US ally when it's a US ally like Saudi Arabia that does it there's nothing to see here but you know if you get a similar story coming out of Iran for example who's not a US ally or they'd love to go after Maduro and I'm not saying he's a good guy but they go after Maduro because he's not a US allies they could harp away on all the negative things about him but we're not having a conversation about Jamal khashoggi we're not having a conversation about people being beheaded in the public square for stuff like sorcery Joe they kill people in Saudi Arabia for sorcery and witchcraft and drug smuggling and apostasy if you don't think God is real and you say that in Saudi Arabia they could kill you they could cut your head off in the public square and we really killing people for a sorcery yes really yes they're killing people for sorcery it's crazy the Khashoggi thing is super disturbing because it seems like everybody's like well what are you gonna do well what are you gonna do I know I mean it would have been cleaner if they just made him have some sort of heart attack or an accident or something along if there was plausible deniability in any way the way they did it it's almost like this guy wanted them to do it a certain way he wanted them to chop this guy up and put him in bags and deliver him out of the country in suitcases and shit or whatever the fuck they did however they got rid of him you know yeah it's such a disturbing decision that they made yeah and they know they're gonna get away with it and again this is what happens right it's been over a year they have absolutely when was the murder how long ago I want last time I was on the podcast we spoke about it and last time I was on the podcast was a year ago so it was over a year ago it's just whatever again if they're our ally that means I mean they really do there's so much business that goes on between the US and Saudi Arabia and the weapons deals and everything that the argument Trump Trump actually made this argument in the White House sitting next to you know the the Saudi Crown Prince he's like they're buying so many weapons it's so tremendous the weapon is their bag and he holds up like the pictures of this from Raytheon and this is what he's getting this is from Boeing this is what he's getting and it's like oh my god imagine for a second it's anybody like imagine it was a deal like that with kim jeong-hoon he's like we're sailing Kim's juggling these tremendous with us today who I didn't see if Kim Jung Jin jong-un threatened us today I think they I was waiting to show you this oh we got Saudi Arabia's anti witchcraft unit breaks another spell what the unit established in 2009 is charged with apprehending sorcerers and reversing the detrimental effects of their spells in the Gulf country let me see the picture scroll up for the picture oh my god that looks like Baghdad Bob remember Baghdad Bob from from the Iraq war where he liked when Iraq was getting slaughtered he was like everything's great Iraq's kicking ass yes I do remember that I was like their Ministry of propaganda guy yeah yeah like how my chela be the guy who they wanted to be the was when the severed head of a wolf wrapped in women's lingerie turned up near the city of how do you say that Kabuto I have no idea in northern in northern Saudi Arabia this week authorities knew they had another case of rich witchcraft on their hands a capital offense and the ultra-conservative desert kingdom is that really what it is is that conservative can boy that term that term is like way too wide if I think both are I think the idea like liberal conservative it casts such a wide net because people like to get sneaky and you know I'm a classic liberal yeah because what is that what is that exactly I can Republican and it's funny because there's actually when you actually look at the textbook definition of a lot of these terms they have multiple meanings yeah so classical liberal in some instances means just like libertarian yes that's what he used to mean back in the day but in today's day and age like you said it could mean you're kind of right-leaning yeah it's more right-of-center right they call classical liberal is a very it's it's a it's a misleading term if you like classical liberal classical liberal is it's a it's a British term correct well I think it originally dates back to it was a way of describing libertarianism that was what they used cuz I think it referred to liberalizing the markets the way the rule perfect yeah the exact that's one of those were I hear people say that and I go both that guy's Republican why is he calling himself a classical liberal yes yes my point and and I don't like labels period because they're so amorphous and and people can say if you if you you can ask people like did you know for example in the Democratic primary in 2016 self-described conservative Democrats supported Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton even though Bernie Sanders is literally further to the left that who the Clinton so again that labels when you say conservative Democrats though maybe they're just not into interventional foreign policy and I mean she's kind of a war monger right and this gets back to the point of labels being so amorphous that here goes sorry classical liberalism is a political ideology in the branch of liberalism which advocates civil liberties under the rule of law with an emphasis on economic free that's what I was that sort of libertarian libertarian so that's like less rules right right regulate the more regulating a free market will take care of a capitalism unfettered is the best kind of capitalism closely related to economic liberalism it developed in the early nineteenth century building on the ideas for the previous century as a response to urbanization and the Industrial Revolution in Europe and the United States notable individuals whose ideas contributed to classical liberalism include John Locke John Baptista John Baptiste to say I don't know who that is Thomas Robert Malthus and I don't know any of these guys it drew in a classical economic ideas espoused by Adam Smith you know at one of the wealth of nations yeah you know that guy do Adam Smith yeah yeah he's like views like the godfather of you know free-market thought in many ways I mean there's other ones don't get me wrong there's Milton Friedman of course and there's a Hayek and there's von Mises but Adam Smith is definitely one that's cited a lot he's the one where everybody talks about the individual hand of the marketplace that's who they're citing when they talk about the free hand of the marketplace or however the saying goes leave this expression book one of the wealth of nations and on a belief in natural law you tear it you you tear utilitarianism in progress what does that mean natural law utilitarianism and progress well utilitarianism means doing the best for the largest number of people yeah but what is natural law mean Adam Smith in one book The Wealth of Nations and on the belief in natural law click on that Jamie what does that mean we're gonna go just the natural law of money from a book oh so I think what I think what it's referring to is like supply and demand and how the way the marketplace works there are natural laws as to how it works and the idea is it's always a negative thing when you try to tweak those laws it works best when you take a hands-off approach your the problem with that I mean there's a lot of problems with that but the problem with that clearly is that when there has been regulation for long periods of time and you just step back you're gonna have a massive period of chaos until things do settle if you do let the market decide I would imagine there's gonna be a period when the deregulation takes place there's gonna be a lot of people that get fucked over absolutely I mean there's a we actually have quite a bit of evidence on this front because we've run this experiment like a thousand times in the US history alone but as a general rule whenever you do market deregulation and whenever you cut taxes for the very wealthy there is what's called a boom bust cycle which means everything takes off everything seems like it's wonderful the good times seem like they're never gonna end remember the roaring 20s they call her roaring 20s because was like oh my god the market is soaring everything's going so well and then was followed by the Great Depression and then you saw it again actually in the end of the Clinton years because Clinton repealed glass-steagall which was a very important piece of regulation and then under the Bush years as well he further deregulated and cut taxes for the rich and what happened we have the subprime mortgage crisis and the Great Recession so as a general rule it's not like all regulation is good full-stop it depends what the regulation is well to argue in favor of regulation of the marketplace is like arguing in favor of referees in a soccer game or whatever like you need some amount of enforcement of things that make sense like I love when libertarians argue like you know well when even like think about would you want to have no FDA at all looking after the drugs that are out there exactly it's ridiculous and you could sell stuff that's cut with substances that could end up killing you I mean this is actually what happened in prohibition they used during Prohibition they used to make alcohol and bathtubs and cut it with substances that very dangerous and so every now and then there would be a bad batch of alcohol and people would die because the way they made the alcohol had no regulation and no standards like what happens today with drugs exactly yes and that's I mean we could talk about I'm sure you saw what happened with that standoff between the Mexican military and the drug cartel dude they beat the government in a standoff in a battle and they ended up freeing El Chapo son well did you see when the Sicario showed up and stirred just start talking to the people in the Mexican military yes and the Mexican military is like hey yeah we're just trying to stay alive here it's what we got to do let them go okay and that's good listen it's such a tough situation because the the drug cartel was just gonna start massacring people yes if they didn't release them so if you're the President of Mexico if you're AM low what do you do I mean if I'm in this position I go hey man I can't have you doing a genocide in a village in Mexico and they're under-resourced there's not right people and the Mexican cartel has an estoppel amount of money Joe the only way to defeat the cartels to legalize tax and regulate drugs yeah because that's how you put them out of business they can't compete with legitimate businesses they can't compete like let's say we had all these growing operations in the US and it was legal at a federal level in the United States what is somebody gonna want to do or they gonna want to go to a back alley with a sketchy character to get some drugs or they gonna want to go to Walgreens well I had the author of hidden war on the podcast his name is John Norris and John Norris he got a job initially as a game warden because you know he grew up in the outdoors and fishing and hunting and things like that and he wanted to be a game warden well along the way started finding these Mexican grow-ops he's cartel grow-ops all over California and it got even worse believe it or not when they made marijuana legal because now these grow-ops are just a misdemeanor it's no longer a felony so if you have a hundred acres on public land that you've decided to revert this take the water from this Creek and send it down there and it kills a bunch of fish and that it's just a misdemeanor for the guys growing the drugs so there's more doing it yes is more doing it and now 80% of all the illegal marijuana that's being grown and sold in the United States rough estimate is coming from these cartel grow-ops and a lot of them are using these pesticides that are very fucking dangerous right yeah see it's because they could just do it they could just set up shop and you know they go to the national forest they go to public lands they hike in with like fucking tubes like hoses and shit on their back so they can revert these creeks or divert these creeks rather and they set up these grow-ops and they bring guns and they fucking set up shop and so these guys these game wardens became like a paramilitary operation they had to go in there with dogs Jerry do yes and they they they had to get trained tactically and these guys wound up being these people that had to take down members of the cartel that soom they're skating woods yeah and I think that we have this weird gray area situation in the United States right now where certain states have legalized if recreational use suits certain states have it for medical use but at the federal level it's still illegal right and if it became legal then these cartel operations would have to go to business it wouldn't be valuable wouldn't be valuable they'd have to move on to something else and then that would open a whole nother Pandora's Box because what do you do let's say you only legalize tax and regulate marijuana well then they might just move on - there might be more cocaine or more whatever my being what they're doing that with meth they figure out a way to grow meth with plants they figured out a way to make meth with plants this is a new thing they haven't been able to do this before meth had always been done with which another thing we need to talk about sudafed what a good conversation that is dren these two when you go to in California at least say if you got a cold and you want to buy some strong over-the-counter cold meds you have to give your driver's license and the read and they only sell you a little bit the reason being is because people used to just buy everything off the shelf throw it into a basket bring it up to the counter and they would use that stuff to make meth with because it's one of the ingredients right actually boiled all down I don't know the process but you can make meth out of cold medication well these fucking guys have figured out how to do this shit with plants now okay so go get go to that say okay plant-based math is the next frontier of Afghanistan's drug trade so investigators have uncovered a burgeoning local trade in the production of methamphetamine using a mountain shrub huh see like now let me ask you this question because I'm a little torn on this next one put I'm of the belief that if you like let's say you legalize lower-level uppers or amphetamines okay so let's say you have a more benign version of all of these kinds of drugs that are legal and available we do it's called adderall no no but you sell to go to a doctor get a prescription for that I'm talking about over the counter right okay so do you think that because I think that would not fully eliminate the market for the much harder stuff but it would I think eliminate a majority of that market because if somebody yes right because somebody goes and gets you know a more safer alternative that might not be as strong but you can go get a safer alternative or get a bunch of a safer alternative then yeah why wouldn't you choose that over doing like crocodile the one that melts off your skin if you do it for like like a heroin that's like heroin bead ones are the ones that are interesting because their productivity drugs and that brings us to trump let's do it this is so much fun there's a there's a photograph of him it's a classic photograph because it's after I love Mexicans yeah he was talking shit about you know the wall and it's all rapists and murderers that is I think this was Cinco DeMayo if I remember correctly so he's eating a taco bowl and the bowl says I mean he says I love Hispanics I think and I remember watching that while looking at that photograph going this motherfucker for real he really tweeted that I love Hispanics and he's eating a fucking taco bowl well the open desk drawer somebody focused in on it and they realized this is like years later they realized that it's all filled with sudafed and sudafed is again the active ingredient you know one of the one of the ingredients in sudafed it's the active ingredient in meth and so apparently people take sudafed and if you take that stuff it gives you like a little bit of a buzz and if you take large doses of sudafed it's essentially like taking like he's micro dosing you're dosing meth it's actually a little deeper than that which makes it even funnier deep yes because there's a certain form of sudafed that they sell in the United States and then there's a UK version of sudafed and the UK version of sudafed has that ingredient to it which is more more of an upper arch kind of acts like an amphetamine look at this it says the desk drawer full of sudafed including boxes in New York perk purchase on the UK indicate yup say that the legal limits of purchase are being circumvented and that the then candidate Trump was abusing sudafed for its high rather than its decongestant effect okay so there's that now I want to take it a step further because I don't know if you watched this video I sent you a while ago but I was absolutely floored by the contrast between the speech Trump gave at CPAC this year and then the speech Trump gave at the UN this year the CPAC one Jo totally off script bouncing off the walls an hour and 30 minutes hands moving all over the place so active so engaging making jokes all this stuff hilarious and then you go to the UN speech Joe he's talking like this and says and he literally he was so tired he couldn't even say the word sovereignty he quit halfway through it he was like and that's why we need to protect sovereigns yeah and so I if you want to pull that up Jamie if you want to watch some of the rest Hackman's show Pakman had David Pakman had a an episode where he was concentrating on this alleged drug use by Trump and he showed the contrast of him sniffing at the debates with Hillary Clinton yes we did a yeah this whole conglomeration of all of his sniffing moments this and let me just say in Trump's defense if I was president I'd be taking some shit too because that's a tough job and also don't lie when he does a rally and he's high as balls on an upper yeah they're entertaining oh yeah and I'm the first one on the left to admit his Twitter feed I feel bad sometimes because he genuinely makes me laugh he J I remember I'll never forget the morning I woke up and I go on Twitter which is like part of my morning routine and the first words I see are from the President of the United States and it says washed up psycho Bette Midler and I just saw that first part of the tweet and I broke down laughing it was the funniest thing that makes me laugh all the time he's done a bunch of shit on his Twitter that you just like this motherfucker is crazy yeah what was the ones that we were talking about recently that he did was it a he tweeted something was bullshit yeah I don't remember what he was saying was bullshit but like they tweeted those words was pretty funny yeah yeah well his Trump isms like the little side things that he always does makes me laugh like to all caps randomly yeah or sometimes they'll capitalize letters for no reason in the tweet well it was great when he was the fucking host of The Apprentice yeah that's when it was great yeah it was like he was a entertaining character it's just now that he's the president it's like whoa whoa whoa this is real yeah I mean I'm I'm curious what percentage of the population is like my mom who really values the idea of somebody kind of being button-down and presidential and very professional sounding cuz that used to be the model and that used to help you in the 1980s and 1990s but I genuinely feel like in today's day and age we've kind of like evolved out of that and you're not gonna get another MIT Romney style politician who's like a robot who's really on script you're gonna get either a left-wing version or right-wing version of somebody who's really kind of shooting from the hip and has no filter because that no filter ISM comes across as just so much more genuine even if he sounds fucking crazy when you talk even if he sounds fucking crazy right I think that's also the same thing with news that's the same thing with news reporters that's why I'm here Joe exactly right and that's why your show works too so you talk like you're talking right now absolutely like I mean and we would be going to dinner tonight we would talk the same way that's right yeah and that exactly that doesn't exist anywhere else and you would see these people that are button-down and then you find out behind closed doors they're freaks you know and then this is it leads everybody to wonder like what what is real what is real that's right someone does talk real and they're like I'm pretty sure that is who that fucking guy is like he's he's that way all the time that's why he's talking that way so with Trump they're like okay at least I know what that is I knew that's a crazy guy who's on speed and he wants to make a lot of money and he doesn't want to yell at Saudi Arabia because he's making money off of them okay WAIS I know what that is with Clinton like especially her like you don't know what the fuck that is you get the sense that there's multiple layers of analysis like and she said it and this was released from WikiLeaks there's a public position in a private position well but the whole polity Gajan thing she called Tulsi Gabbard a Russian asset and I was like what like what are you like let me tell you something I gotta have fucking proof if you are a person who will never stop them but I know but in when you're saying something like that that's such a fucking important thing to say like that's a that's a very damning thing she's a major in the military right now she's in the military yes right yeah well she's a duty Russian asset he's on two tours of duty in the Middle East as you know why they say that - right because tulsi gabbard has spoken strongly against intervention in Syria war in Syria the argument goes hey Vlad ur Putin and Russia are aligned with the Syrian government their allies therefore if you're arguing against US intervention in Syria your argument benefits Putin that's how their argument goes then they also say and this turned out to be totally debunked it not true oh there's an army of Russian trolls that are trying to help tulsi gabbard win the election yeah and Joe but this is the thing that they pull out for anybody who's on the left and anti-war this is what they pull that I've been accused of it before I've been accused of being a Russian puppet and a Russian asset yeah and it's like no are you controlled opposition yeah my controlled opposition and the funny thing is Joe they do this because they cannot actually have a conversation with me and and disagree with me when I talk about policy right of course so I when I sit there and I explain hey here's why medicare-for-all is the way to go and here's why a public option is nonsense and here's why our current system is terrible they want to defend the status quo but they cannot defend the status quo using arguments so they have to just lump me off and put me to the side and say well he shouldn't even be allowed in the conversation because he's a Russian asset and he's not serious but the thing is the the reason why their argument holds some weight at all is because of the IRA the internet research agency and that the the work they've done that was exposed the Russian stuff where they're making all of these different Facebook Twitter and Instagram accounts and they're using them to start to start wars like essentially to start arguments with people about anything and everything to slander people to support people you know say you know as a black woman I could never support Hillary Clinton and then they make these arguments and it's not really a black woman's account it's a Russian and it's a part of this Russian research agency that Renee to rest expose do you ever you ever pay attention to any of her work no I haven't but I'm very skeptical on this point because they always make it seem like if that didn't happen that we'd all be hunky-dory holding hands and getting along they're not necessarily saying that okay but but they are saying that this was effective and there's a millions and millions of engagements and it flavors conversations and for a lot of people and this is a giant percentage of people they do not have time to deeply research and understand these things thoroughly they don't no one does they have jobs and they have mortgages and they have children and they have hobbies and they have friends and and they're doing all kinds of shit on you know when they when they have their time off they don't know no enough time to truly research like was Ted Cruz involved in the Kennedy assassination you mean like when you hear a rumor like that those kind of crazy ridiculous rumors they just they just spread yes and they spread primarily because most people don't have the time to look into these things so if you have something like the internet research agency that's been shown to start a bunch of accounts like they have black life matters accounts they have separatist Texas separatist accounts where they want you know Texas to secede for the you from from the Union and to start their own nation and then they have these pro-muslim accounts and then they have these all these different accounts and they've even organized meetings well they'll have like the the pro Texas account meeting across the street from this Muslim meeting and they'll do it on purpose they'll do it just to try to get people to fight and they have these two different Facebook pages that they're running and they're running them with these propped up ideologies they're pretending that they're this they're pretending there are black lives matter organization or they're pretending that you know there puerto ricans for trump-like it's all--it's but it's madness it's all just starting fights and causing these arguments and right and that they're doing this to try to even if it's 1% or 10% if they can disrupt democracy by 4% 5% here or there it's incredibly effective if they can get a narrative going and they can sustain that narrative a bullshit narrative just through you know coming up with these fake thing it has an effect how much of an effect I don't know but it's in effect if it's 1% if it's 2% if they can get a meme past people and you start spreading it through Facebook and a lot of them she said she looked over a hundred thousand memes and she's like some of them were fucking hilarious and you're reading these and you're laughing and you realize well they're making these things to make people laugh and also to try to get a point across and that point is to you know to try to paint Hillary Clinton as of this or paint Joe Biden as of that or paint you know and what they're doing is they're starting these groups and these groups will argue against other groups and people just kind of go along like sheep and they don't even know who's behind the whole thing yeah I really think this black lives matters group is like African Americans that are you know tired of people isse brutality but it's not it's these guys in Russia they're just starting shit see but it's weird see yeah I hear you but at the same time the thing that is has kind of shocked me is the degree to which this is relied upon and used as the scapegoat to to not talk about sometimes things that are very real issues and I know cuz it's been done like they said with Bernie Sanders there was this Russian troll farm meme created of Bernie Sanders it's like he's like rainbow-colored and he's doing like a you know a pose where he's showing his biceps or whatever and like that was then used by mainstream media to say why is wise Russia trying to prop up Bernie Sanders why is he trying to prop up Bernie Sanders so they try to make it seem like Oh Bernie's like a Russian puppet and a Russian asset and if you support him well you've just been duped to support him and so it's kind of used as this like catch-all thing where it's like if I try to bring up a real issue they Russia wants you to talk about that why are you talking about see this is three-dimensional chess though this is part of the whole dispute part of the whole dispute is you see something like that and then people say why does Russia want Bernie Sanders to be president why they pump it up Bernie Sanders and then this becomes even a more confusing argument like if they do do something like that and they create these funny memes and try to prop up Bernie Sanders and then the argument comes in like why does Russia want Bernie Sanders to win your everything's getting convoluted everything is muddy nobody understands what the fuck is going on that's the point the point is to sow seeds of doubt and to sort of disrupt democracy the point is to do this very cheaply and easily through internet accounts yeah this is the idea behind it and if you listen to sam Harris's podcast with the Resta or the podcasts that I did with her and when she goes into depth about this you know understanding this and how much time she spent researching this IRA this internet research agency in Russia and all the work that they do and they have people working 24 hours a day on this shit and they're doing it specifically under the behest of the government to try to fuck with democracy I just think we have to be really careful point taken I just think we have to be really careful to make sure that that doesn't distract us from focusing on issues that really do matter because often times I've seen that's invoked to kind of shut up the talk about real issues and I'd also add on top of that as well the dirty little secret that we never talk about in this country is that we actually are doing the exact same thing but for sure yeah and sure and I remember that they created like a whole fake website or a whole fake app it for Cuba it was supposed to be like Cuba's version of Twitter and which is all us created and was all trying to control the narrative yeah I remember the story from about two years or so ago well is it like oh fuck America well I'm not sure there's some rules I'm sure no they were trying to do the opposite they were trying to say like who doesn't communism suck isn't an awesome to be subversive don't shoot like your grassroots uprising against doing it for Cuba not doing they were doing what they think is you know free Cuba us secretly created Cuban Twitter to stir unrest and undermine government I mean this listen this is a tool right there's hundreds and hundreds of tools they use isn't it sad that this is what like unfortunately in so many ways this is what politics has become because you and I can sit here and we could have a really good conversation about the minimum wage what are the pros and cons of it what are the polls say on the minimum wage you know if we went down that path how would it impact the broader economy we could have a conversation about unionization we could have a conversation about health care we could have a conversation about foreign policy and you and I can bounce ideas off each other we could talk about market regulation all this stuff but like that's just not what dominates political culture in today's America because you just have this dumbed down conversation where the entire conversation is about stuff like this or the entire conversation is about the the individual cult of personality aspect of politics yeah and that's just really upsetting to a guy like me because what if we actually have that conversation on policy I think there's so much more agreement in this country than people realize you know and oftentimes what I say is if you and I sit here and have a conversation we agree on something that's you know it's a pretty damn good bet that that's a solid position that a lot of people agree with but if two politicians in Washington DC agree on something look out because oftentimes not always but oftentimes they're going to screw you and that's what just happened with again this was about a year or so ago there was all these headlines bipartisan consensus and agreement on a piece of legislation it was all like flowery happy language they agreed to further deregulate Wall Street which again is the thing that led to the subprime mortgage crisis in the Great Recession and this is what you get agreement on between Democrats and Republicans in Washington DC every now and then you'll get two good things like you know Bernie Sanders and Rand Paul coming together Bernie Sanders and Mike Lee to agree war is bad and we shouldn't a to genocide in Yemen okay that's wonderful we all agree that but most of the time it's like let's agree to further help out Wall Street let's agree to further artificially prop up US institutions let's agree to Wall Street bailouts let's agree to more funding for the military-industrial complex and it's like it would we would be so much better off if and this is an idea that I've been pushed for a while now imagine we had a law where every time we had a to vote in a presidential election the people got to vote directly on the top three issues impacting the country and that became law so let's say in the next presidential election one of the questions is so it's a national direct ballot initiative law and that one of the questions could be should marijuana be legal taxed and regulated at a federal level yes or no and then the American people vote on it and whatever we say that becomes law so then it would be you know be like sixty-five percent in favor of it and so we went on that one and you go down the list and you could have the three most important issues and that's a way Joe I think to circumvent the corruption in Washington DC I mean one ways you got you can fight to get money out of politics so there's not as much corruption that's I think that's honestly a longer and harder fight but if you do this national direct valid initiative law I really think that could impact this country for the better and it's an idea unfortunately nobody's really talking about it yet it's not anything like Bernie's I'm with Bernie on so much of what he's talking about and I love the guy but he hasn't spoken about this yet Tulsi hasn't spoken about this yet Andrew yang hasn't spoken about this yet and again these are brilliant people who have great idea they discussed it ever publicly they never brought it up they've never brought her up I actually brought it up in conversation to somebody in Bernie Sanders campaign I brought it up in conversation with somebody else he's campaign and I do think that I'm not and I'm not saying that to go after them because I do think that they're really smart and write on a lot of stuff and I think that in due time they might see this position and really like it and maybe champion it but it kind of in the same way that Andrew yang is now going around and his whole thing is universal basic income and he's kind of putting that into the mainstream of society now we're seriously talking about it he's also doing it with drug decriminalization which I respect him for he goes beyond everybody else and saying decriminalized all drugs so in the same way that he's popularizing these things and shifting the Overton Window I'm really looking forward to some politicians stepping up and popularizing this idea because it's such a simple idea it would be so easy to implement and Joe think of the positive effects of this I mean I remember there was a poll I think it's in the teens like something like 16% of Americans still support the Iraq war which means like everybody's against it imagine if we got to directly vote on that we'd be out of Iraq tomorrow but do they understand the implications of pulling out of Iraq better than the shitty politicians who are corrupt and bought by Raytheon and Boeing and Halliburton right that's what I would say there's gotta be one who could advise someone who has an objective perspective on foreign policy maybe someone who's in the military who's got boots on the ground who can tell you okay here's the problems of pulling out and here's the pros of pulling out here's the cons and get an objective analysis of the situation so at least people are informed instead of just having them vote on it based on public perception have them vote on it based on something here's what I'm afraid of when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail you know what history teaches us is that spent and this happened endlessly in Vietnam presidents came and went they were like you know I don't know I really don't think we should be doing this and they would be talked into staying and increasing troop levels by the generals right now this is not taking a shot at the generals this is just me saying that when that's your field of expertise yeah that's what you're gonna say oh just let us stay there another five months let us stay there another year so we're at the point now where nobody even bothers to define what victory would mean in Afghanistan what victory would mean in Iraq the original reason we were given all we got to go into Afghanistan cuz we got to get al Qaeda because al Qaeda attacked us ok that's understandable Osama bin Laden's dead he's been dead for so long there's only a hundred al Qaeda members according to our own intelligence agencies still in Afghanistan why are we there I think it has a lot more to do with the trillions of dollars of mineral wealth that's there again I think it has a lot more to do with the geopolitical power and the chessboard of US vs. Russia I mean that you know the Soviet Union was there back in the 1980s and like this was we wanted to counter their influence in that region and again with Iraq oil had a lot to do with it as well the military-industrial complex were you know war is a racket a Smedley Butler said you can make a lot of money going down this road so that's Smedley Butler war is a racket scary I encourage anyone to read that that was from 1933 so it's old and he was right and he was right back then yeah and his ideas of what war was for and that really he was just really making things safe for the bankers that's right and look at ease and how're the Eisenhower a Republican president when leaving office warned everybody look out for the military-industrial confidence because people will want to do war because war is a business yes so you can actually become very wealthy if you're perpetually in a state of war I mean look how much again the defense industry in this country Raytheon Boeing Halliburton there are jobs tied to the defense industry in every state in this country that makes it so hard because even if you're nominally anti-war as a politician you can still say well hey listen man I agree but I don't want the jobs on my district to go away right and that is an issue that's an issue politician that's the last thing you ever want to do and have that against you when your opponent is you know saying listen this asshole pulled out and this is why you lost all these jobs and this is why the economy's in the shitter I'm gonna bring those jobs back I'm gonna reinvigorate the military I'm gonna do you know and there we go again so again anyway so the argument in favor of a national direct ballot initiative law like a kind of a direct democracy right idea I thank you I love the idea and I really do think that even though I take your point that it's not like that you know the people are always right but I would say they're way more likely to be right that a bunch of corrupt asshole politicians or then you gotta wonder if the corrupt asshole politicians are gonna make these propaganda campaigns to support whatever idea would suit them we've seen it many times before Joe that's a giant issue I mean we've seen that when it comes to because most of the time with these direct ballot initiative laws it at the state level decide that is in my opinion better wins but sometimes there's propaganda campaigns where they run these totally misleading ads you know about what's gonna happen I know this happened in one of the states when it came to either recreational weed or legal weed they ran these misleading ads where they kind of flipped it and made people think oh if I vote YES on this I'm legalizing weed but it was all the way around that's what I'm saying is they have all these tricks up their sleeves and Ohio was the dirtiest one right Jamie what was the deal with Ohio where they were trying to make it legal but it's here I don't remember the exact thing but I was hearing was that they had it tied up so that only like for business and monopoly fit with me like for like forever forever forever but like for a long one man that like you could it's legal but you have to buy it from me you can't even grow it yourself like what imagine if they did that with Tomatoes okay we're gonna have tomatoes legal in Ohio but you can only buy them from boy like it's a fuck and the tomatoes in the ground how can you stop people from if it's legal it's legal you know I mean there's no laws against you growing anything that's legal right right yeah well there shouldn't be there probably are like so weird rules and regulations on it right some sneaky shit just designed for business right and that's the thing is like that is just rank corruption you and I both know that the reason that came about is because whoever was in charge of the business that was getting that contract yes knew the person in government probably funneled the money for his campaign yes and that's the honestly Joe that's the root of all the problems the root of all the problems is the money in politics it's the corporation's right paying the politicians it's the billionaires paying the politicians and if we can have this thing called clean elections which just means that every election is publicly financed then in a situation like that you would actually see elections run on competing ideas and philosophies and you wouldn't see elections run on competing special interests because right now you could say okay Democrats who who gives money of Democrats unions give money to Democrats so that's an issue some environmentalist groups give money to Democrats so I would argue those special interests are a little less scary but also I mean Wall Street the military-industrial complex also gives to Democrats not just to Republicans right so you have these competing special interests going at it and really you're just trying to determine which group of special interests is going to run the country for the next four years and it'd be so much better if we have like I would love to have debates with people who just actually flat-out disagree with me if you had me and Ron Paul here and him and I argue about economic because he's a libertarian and I'm not I believe in social democracy it would be an awesome conversation we could actually disagree on the substance and really nail down where we disagree and why and let the people make their mind up politics would be beautiful if that was the case but what's interesting is it's always going to be dependent upon a single individual personality that people find appealing that is tough where we are as a country yeah I mean and this is and when someone gets chopped down boy they get chopped down like Kamala Harris when tulsi gabbard took her out the hamstrings that's a wrap baby Tulsi mr. Lutz you for taking down calm I mean dude she everybody was saying she's the one she's gonna run it and talk even thought she would have a stronger run than she did and she fell up but did you see Tulsi made her fall apart it's fascinating she just shrunk into the shadows like she's you know did you see the last debate because that was like keek ok she's done now oh yeah because what was her main issue it was so hilarious to watch this her main issue that she decided I'm going to take a stand on this and the Trump with Twitter was she was begging Elizabeth Warren why don't you support banning Trump from Twitter I mean we're talking about two different sets of rules the most powerful man in the world is violated if she think that that was something that she's surrounded by absolute morons who are democratic strategists in Washington DC and they think okay you have to outflank Elizabeth Warren on her left on some issue so use this issue and try to make it seem like you're standing up for the little guy and you're standing up for a rules even thing cuz Joe I know man because even to people who are on the left that looks like you're just begging for the mods like the real problem is she never did deny what Tulsi said and she can't oh you're about record and how terrible her record the record was awful the fab salutely what she did with schools is the most destroy and see thing yes yes she single moms with jail if their kids didn't go to school and she joked around about it at these meetings she joked around about it and didn't conferences you know about how she cleaned it up and she just had cops knocking on the door ha ha ha you know it was it was bad disturbing yeah what was even worse is there was somebody who was found not guilty on something they were wrongfully imprisoned found not guilty on something when it came back up and then Kamala Harris didn't let him out and kept him in on a technicality and said all your paperwork wasn't filed in the proper time for whatever was on purpose herself she yes yes this is the story that broke and why why did she do that I don't know I have no idea but this is one of the things that you know Tulsi was shining a spotlight on one of the things that Tulsi says which they use them for cheap labor for the state of California and she didn't deny any of that she because her record is abysmal on this stuff I mean there's no there's nothing that she got to this prominent position without any of that being exposed and Tulsi exposed it just like click turn the lights on well look at the Steve minuchin thing this is one that we've known for a while so Steve minuchin was part of Goldman Sachs he also the head of one West Bank here in California and what happened was they were during the subprime mortgage crisis in the Great Recession they were illegally foreclosing on people early and kicking them out of their homes in violation of the law and so Camille Harris uh you know it was recommended by her own office you got to prosecute this guy look what he's doing she didn't do it why because he's a big Democratic donor and he was giving money to Democrats at the time now by the way just in case anybody thinks oh this is just a partisan issue and only the Democrats are bad steve minuchin is in the Trump administration he's hilarious so it's away club and you ain't in it is the point to steal from George Carlin remember when her his wife was taking all these fucking Instagram photos with all the shit she had on private jets and stuff they look like Bond villains bro he's got gloves holding money with the gloves the fuck wears those gloves that go down to your elbows if you look at villains yeah thank you come on she's holding up money she probably feels dirty holding up one's you but the fact the fact that she's wearing those goddamn gloves like oh my god and in the fact that she looks like she should be fucking a football player should be fucking that's got a gazillion dollars that's why kind of hilarious right when you look at the disparity in beauty well these are the got Joe these are the assholes who really run the economy goldman sachs really runs the economy goldman sachs it was proven that they committed fraud at a massive level what they would do is i'm gonna order us a coffee if you'd like one i'm sure i'll take one wrong with our coffee machine okay so anyway steve minuchin steve minuchin and goldman sachs it was found that in the lead up to the subprime mortgage crisis in the great recession here's what they would do joe they would sell to unsuspecting clients these packages these packages of subprime mortgages but they were rated triple-a and they would sell them these packages saying hey man listen this is a great long-term investment it's safe you're gonna make a lot of money at the same time goldman sachs was doing that they would turn around and bet on those packages that they just sold as if they were awesome they would bet on those packages to fail so that's fraud they were making money in two different ways I'm gonna sell you the package and make money okay and then on the other hand I'm gonna bet on this same package I just sold you to fail that's like a car salesman saying oh I'm gonna sell you this car and this car works wonder everything's using car amazing how a tremendous car was unbelievable cars cars everything oh really so it's like angers down salesman doing that Joe and then the salesman also betting his buddy that that car is gonna break down before it gets out of a lot right so these are criminals Joe and the thing is it's Democrats and Republicans who are propping them up the Wall Street bailout costs 14 trillion dollars why is it we could spend money on that but we can't have an infrastructure deal that gives our country an a-plus infrastructure I want us to have the number one infrastructure in the world you had Elon Musk on not too long ago he's working on this thing called the Hyperloop yeah the Hyperloop is supposed to be the future of travel where you kind of get in a pod and it's vacuum power too you can go from New York to LA in like three hours or whatever it is on the ground I want why don't we have that everywhere in this country why don't we have bridges that are fixed why don't we have awesome roads why can't we go to airports and feel national pride and say this Airport is absolutely beautiful some are beautiful Detroit actually has an amazing Airport you know that I had no idea now it's like an airport from the future Detroit has these fucking in interior trams like you're inside and the Train is above you flying by like whoa whoa that is happy know what I like this it's not from the future that is kind of crazy I have no idea about that No yeah but I came from LaGuardia and New York is not oh that's the worst I came from JFK though thangka LaGuardia is number one worst and number two is lax lax is number two shittiest airhead well it's even worse now that they told the uber guys that everyone has to meet you at like a lot so people like will fuck over so now everybody's parking in the lots now good luck trying to find a parking spot in the lots yeah it's dude it's a disaster I was flying that at terminal 2 the other day I had a park in terminal 6 yeah I've almost missed my flight I had a walk a half an hour I was running I had a run told ya it's so bad there's all of them were blocked up they have like no more parking spot signs on all these different differently it's just so outdated man airports in general like it's time to evolve to the next thing yeah you know like is it we're all sick of that it's a whole day to travel somewhere and even if it's just a two or three hour flight yeah but if you go to Burbank it's still smooth as glass I've never been to that Airport it's one of the higher-end it's like oh it's not it's fucking Southwest oh no one goes well we were saying they should have a fly at your own risk Airlines and actually I'm stealing a joke from Bill Marcus he came up that a while ago because when we were coming through TSA I left Nashville to come here so I was a politican there and we had to wait on this line for TSA and it was just never-ending and it's like if they just opened up a line and said hey man listen plane might get blown up but go right ahead I'm gonna take in that object at the time so you have TSA pre and clear no I don't I don't fly too much I fly to come see you and that's it that's it well you got to get clear clears the bomb-diggity you don't have to have ID well there was a life in there pre-check too but clear is not okay that's different okay yeah clear you pay for it and you just put your fingers on a little screen eat it pulls up a picture oh here's Kyle and then you go gone through when will Joe Rogan get a private jet is my question like flat-out own one that seems like that's there's a problem with insulation right as a celebrity period if you're a famous person it's you already have a problem being insulated from regular folks you don't have the same sort of financial problems regular people have and then you insulate yourself further when people are always trying to get pictures with you and talk to you and they don't let you just be yourself you can't just hang so you cross over this weird little area as soon as you cross over fully now I have a staff driving me around and I have a private jet fuck are you yeah you're not you're no longer a man of the people however as anybody can pull it off I think you could if you had a private jet ever but be like oh cool Joe has a private jet but if some you know other famous schmuck did it people be like fuck that guy hmm I think I do think you could pull it off and also I mean let's be honest private jets are so fucking cool private jet that'd be so cool what about the environment man well you know I think can't say anything about the environment man I feel private jet I think that and people always try to do this when it comes to the environment like oh well what have you done are you are you using a plastic straw gotcha that's like a kamala thing you know but like at the same time there's some insane fact like I think it's 76 percent of global emissions are emitted by like a hundred companies so really it's it's not people that are the problems it's the companies and they need to be regulated we can fix that moving forward that's a giant giant percentage of the problem yeah little individual steps that people do to minimize their impact on the carbon emissions and the carbon footprint it's very small in comparison to corporations that's right it's very like pissing in the ocean you're not gonna accomplish anything yeah but it's it's awesome it's all these gotcha points that people want to point to when it comes to things like plastic straws and that's not you know with a real issue it's not plastic straws the real issue is how we handle waste that's the real issue how the fuck of the straw is getting in the ocean in the first place that is kind of crazy and that's the problem it's that Garbage Patch thing I haven't read about this in huge but there's like a fricken like giant boy onslaught who's been on the podcast before who's a very young guy I think he's only 21 years old right is he about 20 or 21 he's very young and he came up with a machine that is collecting garbage from this Garbage Patch the Garbage Patch is larger than the state of Texas now it's enormous it's in the middle of the fucking ocean and it's a soup of particles and particulates and all these little half dissolve pieces of plastic that are just washing and you see a lot of it in the surface but much of it is actually below the surface and you know fish are eating it and they're filling their bellies and birds eat it and it's just absolutely disgusting all right we got some coffees here obviously is a turmeric coffee it's got thanks brother does it work now I don't if I like turmeric this is very simple to ensure merit yeah it's actually got an R in it I don't know because I would have said to American like me too me too until they install this fucking machine here pretty good right that is very good yeah it is very good a little hot but very good yeah so what's going on here Jamie what is this there's this an illustration of the Garbage Patch yeah there I don't know if this is their new machine but the Interceptor I believe was seen in a couple tweets here they have one currently on the way to the Dominican Republic well if you go to his boy owns Instagram he's got photographs and videos of the thing in action and it's like this giant sort of net collection device is this a different one a new one this is fun his Twitter hello it is from his Twitter yeah okay his Instagram though has actual photographs instead of animation okay yeah so that's how it works it's got like this thing and it just scoops them all up and the idea is that they're going to be able to recycle all this plastic which is excellent yeah I think we're at the point now that we it's almost like we have no option but to rely on technology like we have to develop technology to try to course-correct here because my buddy was saying that especially when it comes to climate change it's like it were so far beyond the point where any casual person thinks we are that something has to be done that's beyond just like well cut off all emissions and that's it you know I mean that's a scary thought because then we really are and you've made this point before on the podcast we're relying on like the smartest people to save us at the last minute yeah yeah I mean that is terrifying that's terrifying it's terrifying but they're the smartest people have figured out how to make all this shit that were throwing the ocean in the first place and they also need the guy who created the nuclear weapon remember yes you said that and I learned this from you he said I and become death there's no yes yeah when when he saw the very first when Oppenheimer saw the very first explosion of test explosion said I am become death destroyer of worlds it's a quote from the bhagavad-gita I mean that is a fucking terrifying thing to say when you're watching the the very first atomic bomb we have the ability to destroy the world Oh many times over now yeah which is why I think we're ready for that no boots we're we're talking about earlier today that kim jeong-hoon threatened us yeah it was on CNN I didn't see that either but allow me to say this Jo and that I might get some shit for this I don't care this is the one very narrow area where I'm give Trump credit because there's this part of Trump where it's just anti Obama ISM in its most raw form whatever Obama did I wanna do the opposite right and so Obama apparent well Trump said he said it to me so I don't know if he actually did but Obama really wasn't able to get much movement with North Korea and so Trump felt like well if I can get some sort of peace too it would be tremendous and it'd be amazing and I would one-up Obama and so Trump has actually directly against John Bolton and Mike Pompeo and Gina Haspel and all of his foreign policy advisors who are terrible neo-cons who never met a war they didn't like Trump has actually gone against them a little bit and pushed more in a direction of trying to get peace and by the way the South Koreans are actually leading the way on that and they deserve a tremendous amount of credit and they like the idea that we're not escalating with them so this is a very rare area a narrow area where I want to give a credit but the thing that drives me crazy Joe is I feel like the media and the Democrats too and definitely the Republicans establishment Republicans they're trying to push him in a more hawkish direction which makes no sense because it's like here we all admit oh my god this guy's kind of thin-skinned and he's kind of crazy and he kind of you know flies off the handle and we don't really trust him with the nuclear weapon but you want him to be more hawkish and more aggressive with Kim jong-eun and more standoffish like they got mad when he announced we're gonna stop our our military exercises which are you know very antagonistic and done right by North Korea and is done to let them know like will fuck you up like that's the whole point of is to let them know right and Trump said well I don't think they're a good thing I think they're you know they work against peace so we probably should stop that and then he got a bunch of shit because you know the media was like well what did you extract from them by stopping those those drills what did you get from them as a result of it it's like you need to get anything from them in North Korea and there's gonna blow some people's minds they are not in any way shape or form an offensive threat against the United States there is a 0% chance that they would unprovoked offensively launched an attack against LA or New York or Nebraska or anywhere in fact we know and it's admitted as much when you go to the Pentagon they know he's actually strategically just acting in a defensive way and he wants nuclear weapons as a deterrent to u.s. aggression because this is exactly what happened with Libya where we told Gaddafi after he saw what we did to Saddam Hussein and then we told Gaddafi like give up your nukes and he was like take him you have him and then what happened we still toppled him anyway well it was the next regime right know was Gaddafi yeah but I mean I mean it was you're saying it was about Obama but still the point is the regular took over right wasn't with all the beautiful rebels the point is easy to do with them you can't trust the word of the US because we'll just flip it did it was the the rebels do it with us aid mm-hmm yeah yeah and by the way just like in Syria like we have now their jihadists right that was the famous Clinton speech we came we saw that's that's one of the dark secrets of US foreign policy is that we have repeatedly armed jihadists to further our own political goals and that's that happened with Reagan back back because we wanted to arm the Mujahideen because they were fighting against they were fighting in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union so he wanted to arm jihadist then and of course that became the Taliban and al-qaeda and so that's why I don't know if you ever saw this but there are newspapers from the UK the independent the newspaper the independent calling Osama bin Laden the freedom fighter at the time when was this this was in the 1980s when they had or maybe early 1990s when they had pushed back to Soviet Union out of Afghanistan there were headlines calling him a you know a freedom fighter when he was the head of mood jihad when he was the head of the Mujahideen isn't wasn't that where they restructured the idea of jihad that a jihad was initially supposed to be a battle against your own personal vices this was how was interpreted yeah I think it's interpreted in different ways throughout the Muslim world all that but anti Soviet warrior puts his army on the road to peace ok that's what I meant not freedom fighter puts our me on the road to peace peace what you think about Trump's reaction to Baghdadi getting caught classic Trump the way he did it that he was crying and whimpering like why would he say that well he was also trying to like do a dick-measuring contest with Obama did you see the speech afterwards news like listen but they I heard they had problems when it came to Osama bin Laden but we handled this we handled it so beautifully so amazingly and the the funniest part is apparently when it actually happened he was on the golf course and so after the fact they decided oh we got to have one of those like Situation Room photos like Obama did when when Osama bin Laden was killed and so they staged the photo stages fuck they put all the wires there and some of them are not plugged in that photo was taken an hour and a half after it happened apparently for sure you can pull the metadata out of the photo and find out I was taken I'm gonna pull the picture up so funny sure so well lit that's what's what's fucked up about is like they hired fucking Annie Leibovitz to come in and light the room so money yeah the way it's lit she's looking at the camera I think - he's a character man there it is go go fullscreen yeah please make it zoom it on the wire you see what it is not slug do you know a lot of them are plugged in but I mean also isn't it interesting too that they're still using like they're using wires yeah I mean I guess cuz already a better connection - yeah yeah if you're watching video mm-hmm right so is that HDMI like what are they connected to cat5 just Harry Internet yeah right those could be different but look how well that's lit yeah I mean it doesn't even look like you're all really there it looks fake it doesn't look kind of weird that's for sure but it's funny that like and had a moment like that his thought process was like I have to try to make this as you know as amazing as it is but he feels like you have to go above and beyond to do so that it can't just be on its own like okay you got the head of Isis Congrats look at Mike Pence he's thinking about writing a book right there no actually okay I I think that Mike Pence is actually one of the most loyal Trump people who's least likely to abandon him yeah but I mean when Trump is out of office and has a heart attack from all the meth I think Mike Pence is gonna be together writes the book you think so yeah I don't know man there's something about this guy so so Mike Pence a lot of people don't know this about Mike Pence but he credits his career to Rush Limbaugh because he became a talk radio host and he was so inspired by Rush Limbaugh Mike Pence was a radio host yes but look at the difference between him and Obama that's our money clearly watching something go down yeah that's pretty funny but um yeah he's I think he's gonna be super loyal to Trump even after that the other thing that's interesting about the Trump era is even though he knows how to do relentless offense and not stop attacking Democrats and not stop making his case what you're finding now is that even the other Republicans are struggling to keep up like they can't as much as Trump wants to defend himself other Republicans are now like shying away from doing it right you know well they feel the walls are closing in they do but what's interesting is like I think there's basically a 0% chance he'll get impeached in the sense that he actually gets out of office you think he'll get impeached but you don't think he'll be removed from office I think I actually don't even know if he'll get impeached so I don't even know if it could get through the house but there is a chance it gets through the house I'll put that at 5050 so he can get impeached through the house but he needs you need 20 Republican votes in the Senate to get him out of office and that's not happening right that's just not happening it's not possible not gonna get us what's that not flow I would argue probably not for 99.9% of things maybe there's some unforeseen scenario that I can't think of at the moment that for some reason would make them flip on him but he can almost do anything and get away with it what's fascinating is how Democrats are so they're so invested in the idea that of him being removed that they're saying it as if it is a fact well yeah because there's there's we have it's like narrative Wars you have the one side they have their narrative about how he's guilty on all these things and it's it's not even an open question anymore he should be in peace she should have been impeached a year ago and then there's the other side of it which is just like at least coming from Trump himself I did nothing wrong nothing wrong at all ever everything is wonderful and this is all fake news and we constantly live in a state of like a tug of war between the two realities and yeah I mean what's amazing to me is watching the media agree with the establishment Democrat narrative when it's not like it's not gonna come to fruition if you're spending all your time talking about how he's gonna get out of office he's gonna be impeached that's just a pipe dream do you remember that what what the fuck's the guy's name the GQ guy who had the basement show the result he's all Romania is the most insufferable dude on the planet man so self-righteous so smug see that's the problem in the Trump era is that Trump says Trump's a dingbat and everybody knows it but he's not pretending to be holier than thou where's a guy like he thought is pretending to be holier-than-thou and he puts on this you know this smug act and he starts yelling at everybody and it's like you know you don't even want to be yelling right now reel it in a little bit man brakes dog pump your brakes you know you don't want to be doing this last broadcast he was saying that he my job is done when work is done and that it's days before Trump gets removed from office and that was at least two years ago right and that's the other thing is that there's so much it when was his last show Keith Olbermann it was a while ago it was in a basement with like a cardboard backdrop it's just like a fucking IKEA table and he had some notes and that's why Joe I think that my show is growing is because you know it's so easy to be anti Trump but you have to be anti Trump with intelligent reasons and so my arguments against him are always policy based like there you go all Berman retires at 17 it's almost exactly two years almost they don't understand how much of a cellphone this is and how this actually pushes people to the right but whenever you say something's going to happen that has not happened I mean goddamn with something as important as removing the president from office well you got to be right about that there will be no day of reckoning on that and I promise you and I know that because remember the whole Russia gate thing the first time I was on the podcast I did a rant about the Russia gate thing where I predicted they're not gonna get him on collusion it's not gonna happen that's not gonna happen right I was right yeah Jimmy Dore was right some others were right I swear to God the day after we were proven right there was no in my opinion you are the most reasonable of all political reporters you make the most sense to me I just I've never watched one of your shows well I like this guy's out of his fucking mind I really appreciate you saying true you're you're a normal person like can you call things the way you see them and you're informed and that is so rare man and even the fact that you're able to give props to Trump's ridiculous shit like and say that it's funny we all know it's funny yeah but sometimes you're not supposed to say it's funny but the people with the sticks up their asses they're only hurting themselves when they don't admit that right when no matter what it is they're like I'm so offended he had some recently where we were laughing really hard it was wasn't the Jessie smell a thing it was something after that it was something after that by the way I watched alien covenant the other day I didn't know that Jessie smollett he was in that Bishop held it on that as oh my god I was made so funny it was amazing that Jude has to live with that forever when you get taken down by Dave motherfucking Chappelle oh this one a top three comedians of all time dedicated ten minutes to you and they're trying to act like there's this movement now to try to act like oh he's only accepted now by conservatives but that's just not true with Dave Chappelle there's not hilarious he's just not it's just not true it's nonsense well this is this is the problem with woke culture it's it's reductionist and it's delusional it's just it's not real and they're trying to for they're trying to push this narrative as if they're echo chambers whether it's their blogs or their Twitter groups when they have you know they have these band group so that band people that haven't even interacted with them and they're interacting with people in this bubble and they believe that this is how the world thinks that's how you get something like that Rotten Tomatoes review of Dave Chappelle's where it got 0% by 5:00 woke critics then they release it to the general public gets 99% there you go and it's also this spring back effect where people know you're fucking with them and then they go oh okay well you guys are assholes so the people that are saying that Dave Chappelle special is bad they become the enemy and then so Dave becomes the hero and then even if you didn't like it you're gonna say you loved it ya know and and and the another thing is they act like he's always been politically incorrect us look at hit look at Chapelle show which was you know I was in high school we all watch this pal show and I thought it was like the most brilliant thing ever and the idea that he ever crosses some sort of a line that Steve Shappell the whole point is to cross the lines point of it perpetual line steppers since day one that's why it's so funny would you say Jim with the green land thing we wanted to buy green put the Trump to hotel I'm not gonna do this come and I know first of all the buying the Greenland thing is a great move if global warming is real if that becomes a part of the United States then you can go up there you don't have to worry about it yeah well they say I think that they want rights not just not to Greenland but also there's a movement in the arc right there they want to do this to Greenland come on that shit is hilarious it is pretty funny it's like you got a click on it though Jamie so yeah but Joe they want to do like oils Italy now some say shit in that photo yeah you know Twitter is they only give you like three-quarters of the picture yeah they want to do oil drilling mm-hmm yeah but I mean just the whole global warming is terrifying to me the whole climate change thing is terrifying to me but what's more terrifying I think than anything that is a hilarious but that is funny what's more terrifying than anything is that we some people are resisting it and it because it's become politicized and some people are just buying whole hog into anything that gets said that supports climate change or supports the concept of climate change and that we've gotten into this thing where it's an ideologically based sort of subject ok can I try to frame it in a way that I hope I can convince some conservatives watching this yes because I would love to have the chance to do that so what I would say to them is first of all there's a lot of issues that you care about that this will impact so there was a report that came out about a year ago which found that basically large swaths of the Middle East will be uninhabitable at a certain point because it would just be too hot for human beings to live there we're talking about that yesterday of Saudi Arabians summer where a lot of people from Saudi Arabia come over to LA during the summer because our summary and shit compared desires so and that's the thing is you think there's a refugee crisis when it comes to what's happening in South America you think there's a refugee crisis in Europe when it came to what happened in Syria and Iraq you ain't seen nothing yet right so if you're somebody who fancies yourself against immigration or a hardliner on immigration or against helping refugees or whatever it might be just think about what happens when you multiply what's happening now by a thousand okay because that's what's going to happen at some point it's just a matter of when and the other point I would make to them is this people like to you know make fun of the green new deal and try to pick it apart if we talk about the green new deal and only define it as basically a new new deal so the new deal FDR you know put that into place as was tried to try to fight back against the Great Depression try to get people employed try to fix the country right and FDR kept getting re-elected because FDR was beloved by the entire country because he was fighting for regular working people that was his thing and that's when the Republicans like geez we really should have term limits cuz we can't beat this guy what if when we talk about the green New Deal we're highlighting the fact that yes we're gonna move towards renewable and green technology yes that's gonna be a large part of what we're doing but the whole point guys is millions and millions of jobs created for regular people the whole point is to improve this country to fix this country to try to make it so that our infrastructure is better than the rest of the world what if instead of looking at this is like oh my god this is gonna be such a drain on the economy and what's gonna happen to the deficit how about you look at this like an economic opportunity because what's gonna happen in the future Joe there's inevitable patents that are waiting to be had for all these green and renewable technologies we could lead the world on that front or we could lag behind Russia we could lag behind China we can lag behind everybody else and be stuck in you know what would effectively be a stone-age so they encourage this industry to flourish well be subsidies like how do you what do you do to get these industries to innovate and to pump a shitload of money into green technology it has to do with government contracts it has to do with I mean first and foremost before we even do the right thing you have to stop doing the wrong thing which is stop giving four billion dollars a year every year as a subsidy to ExxonMobil and they hilariously say oh they need this money because it's for research and development no it's not they don't need it for research in the moment there are the most profitable corporations on the planet they can do their own research and development right so stop subsidizing fossil fuels and then yes what we need to do is invest in a variety of different things that show a little bit of promise some things won't work okay some things will work and then we move forward from there and so that's where you could get the Hyperloop all around this country what if all this stuff was built and brought about because we did a massive investment in a green new deal mm-hmm then everybody would talk about how it's a wonderful thing and how we're finally leading the world and in our rightful place I find a hilarious that you know guys like Trump and guys like Joe Biden by the way love to say like there's nothing this country can't do and then in the next sentence think I want to tell you a thousand things that they think we can't do and that we shouldn't do we shouldn't even try well what what technologies have you heard if any that are being even proposed to mitigate global warming or climate change well they're anything there's the classic ones that I think are more effective than people give it credit for like solar is ones that's it's effective the people I don't think he gets its due but then there's other things like thorium now let me just say I'm not I'm not talking about a thorium carks there was a car that was proposing it was apparently was total bullshit they couldn't make a thorium car work but with door thorium thorium is basically the way it's been described to me is nuclear energy without the downside of like you kick it could melt down and destroy everything that's been described to me so a nuclear powered car no not a car we're talking about power for the energy why not a nuclear power well the thorium story that everybody got pissed over was because they were trying to make it seem like he was right around the corner they had the plans and it just wasn't and those people were full of shit but that doesn't mean thorium is bad and totally off the table it just means that that specific car they were talking about was nonsense okay but if you have thorium reactors it's basically like meltdown proof or a nuclear facility that's how it's been described now I'm an idiot I have no idea how far off we are from actually developing that but I do know that we need to invest in this and other things that show potential I mean that's the only way to move forward and the nuclear thing is very interesting right because a lot of the technology that's a problem today like what happened in Fukushima is old nuclear technology well old technology that you can't really shut down but they've mitigated a lot of those issues apparently when you talk to people that are pro nuclear when they talk about the future of nuclear power they're like look the we have systems that have all this redundancy in place you can shut them down there they're much safer than the things that they constructed essentially in the 70s and the 60s I'm skeptical on that point yeah and I'm skeptical because at every step of the way they they told us that so with Fukushima before it happened they said oh don't worry this is this it would never happen here and then what happened was of course you add the earthquake and then you had the tsunami and they were like oh we um we built the seawall high enough yeah that's like an engineering 101 mistake and I'm gonna tell me you have everything figured out on that front so I'm a little skeptical when it comes to nuclear for obvious reasons Chernobyl there's a Three Mile Island five mile island whatever is called and then Fukushima but I do think that that doesn't mean I would you know ban all nuclear today but it does mean I think there are better ways moving forward they're cleaner that are safer right and Solar is a big one particularly in places like Los Angeles but with solar you also need batteries and the battery technology apparently is not as good as would need to be in place in order to power an entire city like LA even though we have Sun almost every day of the year you know like bright Sun very few clouds almost every day it's so nice it's very nice right no no you come over here like I know I'm like because now in New York it's you know you're finally getting old I'm going there on Thursday dude when you'll notice this too and you've been there before but it's uh you don't even realize it's impacting your mood until you come here in October November December notice when I lived here when I first lived here when I first moved here in New York yeah me and my friend Gary were like well here this this is crazy look outside it's fucking so sunny it's fucking January man so I don't think I have seasonal depression but I definitely have a worse mood in the winter yes and in the late fall oh yeah yeah it's that is seasonal depression that's less depressed then you could be right - Lee not rest up as you would be if it was nice out the Sun just gives you energy you want to do stuff you want to be productive you also get spoiled it's like the equivalent of being a weather-based trust-fund baby that's a great point yeah that's a great point you always have money so you don't worry about money well if you were grew up poor and you felt the sting of poverty and you didn't know where your next meal was coming from and you had to work really hard then when you make some money you feel great but if you always had money you're spoiling you don't realize it so somebody's always lived in LA and never traveled there they would they're just like this is just what it is appreciate it they're appreciate they don't appreciate it and they're soft they don't understand what weather is they know understand they don't have a real relationship with nature and I think when a snowstorm comes you have a relationship with nature and also there's more of a community bond with the people around you because you're all in it together I mean really have to rely on people that's very true car gets stuck on the side of the road you gotta help each other like it's different it's a different feel even in a place like New York City there's a bond that happens when everyone's collectively dealing with some shit particularly some nature shit yeah I've heard you say that you think you know my northeastern people are harder they're harder people yeah but it's also they're they're the children of more direct and recent immigrants and the atmosphere that those immigrants have created right like my parents were second generation right my grandparents were first generation they came over from Italy and yeah grandma on my mom's side Italian so all those people they came over they were fucking savages basically they hopped on a boat they barely didn't have a video to look at he's fucking you know they can't YouTube it just took a crazy chance and hop in the boat and coming over here from Europe right they land on the shores and they live in these immigrant communities you know they're all walking down the street to buy bread from this guy and sauce from that guy and they're all they're all eating Italian food because they're all Italian they're living in these Italian neighborhoods and you know and everybody's like fucking struggling hardcore and they have this hard-ass attitude of the kind of people that would be willing to take a boat ride across the country one of things you realize when you go to Italy versus Italy versus Italians in America times in Italy are more relaxed well it's all you more chill from what I've heard because I've actually I've been to Canada and I've been to US territory of Puerto Rico I've had never been to Europe yet okay and I've heard it's like there it's a totally different culture in the middle of the day they'll just drop everything they're doing and everybody goes and eats and takes a nap and relax a little bit dude Italy is so relaxing the food is sensational and it doesn't the weather never sucks I like the idea of that but if you actually put me in that environment I'm so used to going going going going going all the time that I might actually be like this is weird and crazy you'd go crazy which is weird because I love the idea like I think for example the u.s. is like the only developed country in the world that doesn't have paid vacation time by law yeah like in other countries you might get like a month off in August or whatever and you do everyone and you're paid here we don't have that I definitely support an ID like that but I do wonder how I'd react to that like big chunk of the middle of the day missing you don't work to her in that middle of the day I do wonder how I'd react to I think a four-day workweek just probably good idea though I like that idea is a great idea three days off for days on is the right move that's already listening I hope Bernie's listening you think he's listening you recently he's taking a nap right now himself okay but we have we have to say though and this is incredible right before I came in here I looked and on there's a new poll that came out of New Hampshire a CNN poll nonetheless he's now is he but that's cuz he's from Vermont no no but he was down before he's leading now and furthermore an emerson poll came out he went up five points post heart attack five points he went up host heart attack I'll tell you know how you always say about adversity like if you overcome adversity yes he's like the prime example that there were because I know people in his campaign and they were telling me that literally the day of by the end of the day he was like okay I'm feeling much better let's go that sounds like wishful thinking I mean that's what they were telling me was Kyle I love you you're a great guy that sounds like wishful thinking and I love Bernie and I had them in here and I really enjoyed talking to him and thanks to you because you set that up but when you have a fucking heart attack your body's telling you something your body's telling you hey man you fucking you you need to stop redlining this engine they're making him will go back some events a little bit and he's reeled it in exalted fifteen percent you need to get him on steroids get him on the magicJack get him on the juice get him on the shit Trump's on steroids and some form of amphetamines a day you'd be hilarious fi diamond rips all day long they should give him a vitamin drip in the morning a vitamin drip in the afternoon just change that what he saw I don't know what he's eating but it doesn't he's eating the right stuff I think there now he's on a right very regimented thing is not for nothing that work did you see the debate right after the heart attack because he looks so much better he did it's crazy it's like he knocked something loose that's right I didn't know I was being held back Joe I had a bomb Ottery yeah he really did have a bomb artery right he got a stent put in it but the thing that's so amazing is that he's and killer Mike who you also had on the podcast who I absolutely loved he said it best he said this is the only candidate in my lifetime who's taking dr. Martin Luther King Junior's philosophy and trying to run it across the finish line yeah Mike loves them and I love mic so I mean I think the whole thing about him that that worries people is just his health in his age and you know and then there's people that want to label him as a wacky socialist but when he explains his positions outside of that whole debate environment where you only have 30 seconds to scream right now it's system and there's a difference Joe between socialism and social democracy yes and social democracies Scandinavia that's all it is yeah so it's saying hey we're not totally scrapping capitalism we're not gonna have everything government-run all we're saying is let's catch up to the rest of the developed world when it comes to single-payer health care everybody gets health care everybody gets college we're gonna abolish student loan debt we're gonna have fair wages for everybody so nobody's working full-time and living in poverty yes when you explain this like you just said when you explain this to everybody they're like I can't believe I thought I ever dislike this guy well as all those things are as fucking reasonable as you can get and if you're going to have a community which is essentially what a country is right we're a community we've got to take care of each other what's the best way to take care of each other well let's support each other so that if something comes up some sort of a catastrophic health crisis you're covered we cover you we love you we are a community if you have a heart attack if you've gotta this you got to that you need a leg fixed whatever the fuck it is you're covered for that okay well maybe we shouldn't cripple you with debt when you're 17 years old and you don't understand what the fuck you're doing and we get you involved in this ridiculous system where you can never get out of it even if you go bankrupt you still owe that money forever we're at a point right now in this country where people who have Social Security they're on Social Security they're getting money from their Social Security taken out because they os-- to dn't loans if that's not the most desperate and gross fucking feeling in the world disgusting yeah it's crazy and we have some weird creepy coalition I mean there's some creepy like agreement that they have with these financial institutions and these educational institutions where they've they're essentially financially imprisoning young kids at an early age and people say whoa you shouldn't make that decision shouldn't shouldn't break the decision and put yourself in debt like that okay that's great but this is that's a very unscientific perspective because you're talking about someone brain isn't even fully formed right frontal lobe you're not even a fucking real human until you're 25 years old so let me I want to address because I can some people are gonna hear what I just said about you know medicare for all single-payer health care and they're gonna say yeah but how we gonna pay for it because that's the comments one that sure will bring up now let me address that because that's a really important question and usually when you actually substantively address it people go oh okay that makes a lot more sense how are they gonna pay so very simply put the way the system works right now it costs more than if we had Medicare for all why is that because we have an unnecessary for-profit middleman that essentially acts like a mafia so what we're saying is I'm gonna remove that mafia from around your neck and you're gonna it's basically what is that mafia you referring to a mafia is the for-profit health insurance company so they have to they have to take their cut as the middleman between you and your doctor okay if we just remove that have the government at no profit margin be the single insurer that's what a single-payer means they're the single insurer then we actually end up saving five trillion dollars over the course of ten years and that's not Kile kolinsky talking that's a detailed study from the University of Massachusetts Amherst now talking that's a liberal fuckin place so what do you do when you have all these insurance companies like what happens to those insurance companies well all those jobs what happens all that money the insurance companies go away go away I mean they go witnesses go under so you kill yeah if I if I say you're not allowed to cut your lawn okay unless let's say the guy wants to charge you $100 right I say no Joe I'm I'm gonna be the one who pays the person who cuts your lawn you have to give me $200 okay so if somebody came along and said no oh oh oh oh hey middleman guy we're gonna get rid of you and Joe you wanted to cut your lawn give that guy hundred dollars and you're all set wouldn't you say well that makes sense I the middleman guy it's he can piss off because that's the way I look at it the reality is when people argue for choice and health insurance look at it like this would you say hey man don't take away my choice when it comes to picking my firefighter people what do you mean no the way it works is there's a fire and you get help end of discussion they will come you don't say whoa want to pick my fire department well this is the same thing with health care the idea you're gonna be able to pick your doctor that's perfectly fine okay but the idea of you'll have your choice between insurance companies that's like saying pick which mut do you want the Irish mafia ripping you off or the Italian mafia pick ripping you off for the Jewish mafia ripping you off go ahead I'm giving you choice right right in some areas the the idea of choice is fundamentally absurd it's like saying well let's hat let's shut off the road system instead of being public let's have it privately run and you could turn make a left on that road make a left on that road or make a right on that road don't take away my choice of road I want to pay for that one or that one that one no it's all there it's all free at the point of service and this is a whole idea of having a public utility there's the whole idea of having something that's off the table in a civilized society right and again what the studies show is it actually saves money so the real question people should be asking is how can we afford to keep having the system that we have right now because we pay more than the rest of the developed world and we have thirty to forty five thousand Americans that die every year because they don't have access to basic health care and we have five hundred thousand people who go bankrupt as a result of medical bills so what you're saying is that they would it would abolish insurance companies essentially so there is one caveat to that and that caveat is what's called supplemental health insurance so what that means is if there's something that Joe Rogan likes that's a medical procedure that isn't scientifically proven yet but it's still something that you like there would be private health insurance companies that sell you supplemental insurance which means on top of everything that you already have through Medicare for all so if you were giving like stem-cell therapy or something well steps in in an ideal Medicare for All system and Bernie believe me has gone so far above and beyond any criticism I mean his thing is airtight it gives dental it gives vision it gets everything I would be surprised if funded that Medicare for all bill the stem cells thing is covered but let's say something like homeopathy which is like the worship horseshit total horseshit no I cover that by insurance no Medicare for all would not cover that because it's so speculative in Horsham insurance I'm at horseshit insurance or or or plastic surgery things of that nature but that's an important force because real they have private surgery or private insurance for for plastic no no no I'm saying it would they don't theoretically legal for it under a medicare-for-all system because it's supplemental how could you have insurance for plastic surgery like I decided my ears are too big so maybe the market maybe the market wouldn't be there but it would be legally possible is the point so it doesn't fully ban private insurance plan it bans what's called duplicative care so you can't say hey I'm an insurance company I'm gonna come in and offer you something that's already covered in full by the single-payer system and the reason why that's there is we don't want you getting ripped off by some charlatan passing on your same but it was it would essentially gut the health insurance industry it would make it so that you no longer have health insurance company CEO is making tens of millions of dollars off the backs of people while people die because they can't get health insurance yes it would and that's a good thing that's a positive it's a good thing for us but as a sale like to sell that well well the thing is there's we have this issue where we have like a status quo bias where people think like well because it works how it works right now therefore the idea of addressing it and changing it seems like so overwhelming that we just kind of default to how we have it now but the problem is we know as a matter of fact that the way we do it now is the most batshit crazy way you could possibly do it because they research this stuff all the time they study this stuff all the time and every single time they look at it the u.s. comes dead last in the developed world when it comes to health care so we finished there was a recent study from the Commonwealth Fund they found that they studied 11 different countries the u.s. is 11th out of 11 when it comes to health care so every other country that does the single-payer system which we were talking about and there's different versions of it there's multi-payer there's single-payer there's private funding of Kootenay there's public funding of private insurance public funding of public insurance but bottom line is any other way you do it is better than the way we do it right now hmm okay and just to be clear because some people say well what about Obamacare what was Obamacare Obamacare was originally a Heritage Foundation plan which is a right-wing think-tank so that was basically Mitt Romney's health care bill Newt Gingrich's health care bill and the whole idea was that of that was we're gonna force people to buy private insurance right and that's not I don't like that idea at all I dislike that mess I've been very critical of Obama care I think there's a good case to make that it was a step in the right direction because anything was better than the system that we had at the time but I would say that was just a little step on the path to what we should have which is a Medicare for All system where health care is a right and not a privilege we catch up to the rest of the developed world and again we should go above and beyond the rest of the world because like in Canada I don't think they have dental covered by it but Bernie's bill does provide dental so you know I think that this is one of those issues where when it's fully explained to people it's kind of a no-brainer and you can get people to realize like no no no the system is totally screwing you right now and we can fix it do you think he has a chance oh absolutely Bernie Sanders okay absolutely I do now let me ask you this who of the Democrats do you foresee really beating him beating Trump no no beating Bernie in a primary mm-hmm well it's good question right it's a very good question he's got a lot of support for sure but Elizabeth Warren seems to have a lot of support right now - okay so that's your answer right Elizabeth Warren yeah I would say well Joe Biden's fucked he's too old but old in the wrong way like his communication skills have eroded he floods his words he looks exhausted he looks like he's just waiting for them to shut the door so he can take a big deep breath or sink into the couch you know I'm saying oh I know exactly what you're saying I feel sometimes I feel bad because it appears like he genuinely has cognitive decline yeah well he does so I don't like to make fun of it but then when he goes out there in the debate and he starts like angrily ranting and he says you know we got to play the record player at night make sure the kids hear words like that made less than no sense man what are you doing you got to wrap it up did you know that his people actually they have a plan it's called like a limited exposure or limited visibility campaign where Joe they are literally like hiding him from the public as much as possible well they have to they have to as he's still close to the lead right Oh in some polls he's still leading that is hilarity and here's the thing and this is what I was going to get to in relation to Bernie I call the support for Biden default support so default support is people who don't necessarily follow politics that closely but they might be a registered Democrat and their ass hey who do you support in this twenty families I don't know who's running Oh bye nobody was a VP of Obama sure yeah Biden why not that's the kind of support I think Joe Biden where that is very very likely to kind of dwindle away and we're seeing it right now because when you look at the fundraising numbers Bernie is breaking all records when it comes to individual donations even out raising Trump and Trump's our Beast on the campaign trail he's nothing to mess around with on the campaign trail but he's even out raising Trump when it comes to individual donations his ground game is airtight he's got people everywhere making phone calls knocking on doors getting involved and so he has basically an endless well of in small individual donors support and an army of people on the ground whereas Joe Biden is doing so bad that he went back on his pledge like oh I won't take super PAC money now he's saying well if somebody were to make a super PAC and it were to help me out what do you want me to tell you because he raised nine million dollars in the last quarter Bernie raised thirty and Joe raised nine so Bernie happy lookie politics I love talking about politics that explaining everything I know but you're so Bernie happy well yeah cuz Joe he's uh he's an amazing candidate who's just trying to get the us to have social democracy and he's a guy who I know cuz his record shows it he's gonna fight for all of us even if you don't agree with him and even if you dislike him I understand that you might be somebody who's right-leaning he's too far left for you but what everybody has to say and they know it's true is he's incredibly honest and he's actually gonna fight for you every step of the way yes no I think you're right I'm and talking to him he's a very sincere guy and I think a lot of his policies I agree with I really really agree with this whole the the exoneration of student loan debt that that to me is a giant factor in a lot of poor decision-making that a lot of young people make because they're fucked because they have this massive debt hanging over their head it's a huge source of stress and I think it's a rigged system I think it's dirty it's a dirty system yeah the Medicare for all I think is a wonderful idea as long as you can seek you know very talented orthopedic surgeons if you got some money we need something fixed and you always pick your doctor you know because you got a there's a certain incentive right that I think that certain doctors have towards excellence right and a lot of that incentive is financial and they're the the doctors that are the very best in certain particular fields they want to charge more money for their services and I think that that should be okay that's this one of the things that helps make people more enthusiastic about excellence it's its financial reward it's a part of human nature no absolutely and that's what one of the things that people despise about the concept of socialism is that it's going to somehow or another by you know making sure that no one makes any more money than anybody else which is like the most extreme well that's like authoritarian communism yes yes yes but that's some I don't agree with that at all either and people who I talked to who are my friends on the left they don't agree with that at all and one of the things that we get most annoyed with is when there's like a conflation people will look at the former Soviet Union people will look at Venezuela people will look at Cuba and they'll go hey well there's that's what you want and that's what they say to us and whenever we respond oh man we're talking about social democracy we're talking about what they have in Scandinavia there's usually no substantive rebuttal to that right other than to say and what's funny Joe is they will take credit for those systems in some ways so it depends if you talk to Ben Shapiro on one day he might say no no no Joe those systems are so good because their capitalist twin extent okay and then if I fire back at Ben and I go okay Ben then let's implement that style of capitalism he'll swish it and say no no they're socialists oh we can't do that well what is it we have a giant problem in this country with this whole right-left set shit you know and this is what I was trying to say earlier when we're talking about the concept of classical liberals because most people don't even know what the fuck that means the idea behind it I just think that to have groups of people that think in certain ways the problem with ideologies whether it's left-leaning or right-leaning is it makes you automatically predisposed to ignore or to refute the concepts that are on the other side and so many of us share these ideas across the board and when one group is committed to one concept like one of the things that you do see this about climate change people on the right are more inclined to deny the negative effects of climate change because it's part of the right wing the right wing ideology this is something we see today I need to get so you're right but also I would just advise people don't get too lost in the noise because we can think that that's something that's overwhelming and we can't defeat it and we could also think that you know for example the whole Russia gate thing on the Democratic side yeah that was that became such a fundamentalist religion and you couldn't was exciting we wanted it to be true and people would believe it and argue for it even though the things weren't adding up and I was trying to point out where it's wrong but what I would say is at the end of the day people should actually be relatively happy about the fact that I think the most the strongest divide in the country is not right versus left the strongest divide in the country I've called it populous versus elitist yeah so you have elitists in the Democratic Party you have elitist in the Republican Party and you have the people and the people are we're so much more in agreement than people give us credit for you know I agree I have a thing that I go down and I did this in some of my events at Politico as well but people would be surprised man 80% of the country wants to raise the minimum wage 58% of the country wants to have free college like I said only 16% or so of the American people want to be involved in Iraq and Afghanistan and these terrible Foreign Wars sixty-two percent of the country wants to legalize marijuana I could sit here and ring off issue after issue it's over 80 percent of the American people want to get the money out of the political system and clean a finger option do you think that this country has room for other parties we are so ingrained in this idea of left versus right Democrat versus Republican and this is the choices that we've always had with the occasional independent the occasional you know Ross Perot jumps into the race and throws a monkey wrench into everything but other than that or maybe in an amount to minor extent Garry Johnson but do you think there's room for other parties at this juncture so that's a great question and what I would say is first let me give my personal take on it my personal take is i 100% want that to be the case because i prefer in many ways aspects of a parliamentary system to our system and i like the idea of having multiple parties i like the idea of having more choice so i want that to be true and when i was one of the cofounders of justice democrats when we launched it we had to have those difficult conversations about how exactly do we go about trying to get these ideas implemented right and basically we came to the conclusion that as much as we want it to be true as much as we'd like to start a third party and have it work and take off there is such a gigantic systemic bias against that happening that you really do have ultimately the choice of republican or democrat so then the idea becomes okay it's a reform movement now we have to try to reform the Democratic Party and there are people on the right who can try to reform the Republican Party like if you're somebody on the right and you agree more with Ron Paul and you're more libertarian you want to end the wars you want to legalize drugs I hope those people take over the Republican Party and you have people who are against like corporate welfare and whatnot in that party so what we really need to do is because it's just the nature of our system because there's such a bias against their parties what we really need to do is harness all that energy to fix things and just try to take over the existing infrastructure because you're not gonna build a counter infrastructure because there's so much name recognition it's like saying there's Democrat and there's Republican yeah technically we could start up RC Cola and see if we could get a significant market share but you're not gonna do it you're not gonna do it it's not gonna work so really and again I don't want this to be the answer but just factually speaking it is the answer that we have to try to overtake you know the corrupt elements within the system and and bring about change that way because that's the only way I think it will really work well the only way it's gonna really work is if what you were talking about with voting on very specific issues because if you most of the things that are problems are not benefiting people they're benefiting the people that are in positions of power and positions where they can influence the way policy is dictated because they've contributed to campaigns and because they've got this sort of revolving door thing going on with universities where mathematics professors and economic professor is sort of dictate policy or or advise and then they get jobs and banks and then you've got this whole weird thing going on with people in the government right that's right that's it I mean that was exposed in what was that the inside job inside job which is a fantastic documentary for people to understand the collapse but you it's not benefiting us all these things that happen and all this corruption that takes place and all this influence doesn't it never benefits us it's only exactly right but that's what's weird about it and if we got a chance to vote on most of these ideas instead of voting on politicians and then the politicians implement these ideas to benefit themselves and benefit the special interest groups who got them into place then things would be much better okay um you have no idea how happy I that you just said that because Jamie it's official I sold Jill Rogan on my idea it's a great idea democracy law it's a great idea right off right off the bat I loved it cuz I trust and I have no problem saying that some people will come after me for it I don't care but I trust if somebody's watching this and they're right-leaning and they have their opinions and whatnot I actually trust that person more on the issues then I trust Chuck Schumer or Nancy Pelosi and I'm somebody I'm on the Left right and I do not agree with these nominally on the Left politicians these Democratic politicians because I think they're elitist and I think they're corrupt and I don't think they're looking out for our best interest but I think that somebody who disagrees with me ideologically who might be watching this right now they have more common sense and they're not bought right there's no point right that's the big things on par there's so much more agreement than we think yeah and so if you actually give people that option where you say no no you're gonna directly vote on this and I think we're gonna see honestly I think over 80% of the time the more reasonable position will win every now and then you'll get one that for whatever reason there might be misinformation or whatever and it's overwhelming and then they'll lose but right getting it right 80% of the time is a hell of a lot better than what we have right now which is amazing Joel because Congress routinely polls around 20 percent favorability this is a body that we like we could just elect them and then you poll a month later hey what do you think of Congress everybody's like I hate them they're terrible how can that be it's because we all know we're voting for the lesser of two evils every time we go to the polls yeah direct democracy direct my every presidential election take the three biggest issues we all vote on it along with who we present well that's just arbitrary we could say five whatever it might be but I think that it's good between three and five I think makes the most sense because you wants it's something where everybody will pay attention to it we could talk about it a lot you know what I mean that's seems like a very realistic sense his system of reform that's what I'm think it's a good idea I mean I and I think that would really nip in the bud a lot of corruption goes right around it yeah it goes right around it now I also think that at the same time you do have to try to do get a constitutional amendment to get money out of politics so that we kind of get to the root of the corruption but I also think that this direct democracy idea is a great idea because you do get to go right around the corruption and you can actually kind of circumvent a lot of the problems that are brought about as a result of it what a difficult task that is though to get the money out of because it's so big it's such a giant part of how all this shit gets done and once a system gets entangled and like deeply rooted that's right but the system of it is actually kind of new it has a really fascinating backstory as to how this came about so there were a series of court decisions there was one in the late 1970s was that Buckley versus Valeo or was that Pilate whatever there were there were like three or four court decisions over the years starting in the late 1970s that kind of culminated with citizens united in in the modern era and McCutcheon in the modern era and what people do is they wrongly think like citizens united and McCutcheon were the the biggest problem but no they actually shot a dead horse because the previous court cases set the precedent of money equaling speech this is the legal theory that's now operating around the country is that money equals speech so if you want to if you're an outside group and you want to spend on an election hey man it's your free speech if you're a billionaire and you want to dump 550 million dollars into an election to say keep my taxes as low as possible that's free speech you have every right to do that so that's the legal theory that we now operate under and that has basically legalized bribery you can't like give money directly to a politician and say I want you to do X because that's called a quid pro quo that's direct bribery but all you have to do is add a little bit of nuance and don't say it directly and have it implied and you're good so when this is the Ukraine thing Trump this is essentially exactly you're talking about that is kind of like the Ukraine thing except with Trump was just trying to get dirt on his fart on his opponent in the election but they know it pro quo aspect of yeah that's always been weasely whether it's Trump saying it or whether it's a politician saying it when they act like hey there was no quid pro quo yeah but we all know why exxon mobil gives millions of dollars long as congress to a tune of millions dollars because they want that four billion dollar subsidy everybody knows that it doesn't have to be a player lee yes we're not idiots everybody gets that and so that's like the weaselly last resort to say no quid pro quo right please get out of here so anyway but there's an argument that really busts up this idea that money equals speech that i absolutely love and it's okay well if money equals speech then murder-for-hire would have to be legal because i'm not saying i'm not giving you money to murder somebody I'm just using my speech to say I don't have a with murder you're allowed to do that you should be able to get any kind of drug you want you should be a little any kind of prostitute you want and the dodge will always be I'm not paying for services no coz money equal speech I'm just saying I'm just saying murderers okay I'm just saying you know I want to Hooker or whatever it might be you know what I mean so but this is this is the logic of that ruling actually applied I see what you're saying right yeah Oh money equals speech okay does it equal speech in these ways oh it doesn't oh it only equals it when it comes to politics that's interesting do you have aspirations of running for office someday I don't really um really is a weird word well okay I'll explain what that means I've learned to never say never okay because I'm not it's just you can be wrong so maybe when I'm 42 years old I get the urge and I say you know what I want to run for office but right now you're you enjoy talking about it quite a bit in your how old are you I am 31 that's very young to be as immersed in politics as you are and as for as long as you've been yes how long have you been doing this twenty twelve I started doing it I think late 2012 full-time yeah that's seven fucking years man yeah it's a long time I'm an old young guy yes yeah that's an interesting way of putting it yeah yeah but I mean I love this aspect of it Joe here's the thing in my heart of hearts I'm more like you're a comedian yes I'm more like I like hanging out with guys like you and fucking around and joking around and I don't like like if I were to ever officially jump into politics I know what it's like man I know the first thing they do is cuz they've already done it to me Oh dig up his old tweet see what he was saying oh he said that thing that thing is wrong and then it's all right this whole circus I don't have the patience for that I don't give a fuck if they come after me I'll be like shut the fuck up I don't care it's all who gives a shit so you know it's it's just it's a whole other world it's a whole other ballgame and being an outsider and being able to call a spade a spade because I Got News for you they don't the system does not like people like me the system does not like people like Bernie they don't like people like tulsi they don't like these kinds of people well they don't look people like Trump either and he's the president well exactly and again this gets back to the whole populist versus elitist thing I think Trump was probably the most effective what I would call a fake populist of all time is that he was giving this image of a populist this image that he's gonna fight for the working man and then as we already described earlier you know the status quo just kind of continued chugging along as it is look at his tax bills the most establishment pro-establishment bill of all time so he's an amazing populist or but I would say it's a fake populist cuz his policies differ from that but you're right they don't like people who have no filter they don't like people who really like I actually think your average American would be much better at running the government than any of these Schmucks who are there right now or you know massively wealthy and massively corrupt as long as they didn't also become corrupt yeah and that's that's the important point about why you need systemic reform is that any normal person can become a part of the problem because the system will beat you down right and that's just the nature of the way it works but no I don't want to run for office because I'm doing you enjoy just commenting on it and also you enjoy doing it on your own time you do it whenever you want to I make my own schedule don't get me wrong I mean I pump stuff out yes like crazy you do but you also don't have an overlord no boss I can't I can't have a boss I don't have that personality that meshes with it I just don't and I'm you know it's like trying to tame a zebra you can't do it you could tame a horse you can't tame a zebra it's a good boy yeah so can't tame a zebra sir I don't want to do it I know that some people want me to do it but it's not I don't like the idea of it well I always enjoy talking you man and we should probably do these more often because I learned a lot of shit from you too thank you sit fills in blanks and like I said I think you're the most reasonable guy that's doing this in terms of like doing political commentary on YouTube and on the Internet I really appreciate that that means a lot coming from you let's do it more often my friend sure man always got to force me on a plane that's it of course you want to plan thank you thank you very much thanks man tell everybody how they can get a hold of your Instagram and I don't have an Instagram I have a Twitter I'm like Trump only Twitter at Kyle kolinsky on Twitter and it's secular talk on YouTube okay yeah thanks oh my buddy yeah that was fun we could go for like five hours
