hello freak bitches so so the reason I the reason I think a guy like that gets that good especially so quick is because he doesn't have a favorite part he doesn't have like he loves the whole thing hmm you know you know you know those guys that they're good strikers and they love striking so that's what they want to do all the time like no he works on everything because for his offense to be as good and his defense to be just as good a lot of guys just want to be offensive guys just want to win in the gym guys want to get on top and they want to stay there they want to control mm-hmm so when those guys get put on their back they don't really know what to do or they have a much harder time escaping or transitioning out of that position but not a guy like that though those are the best guys in the world you look at you look at DJ you look at DOM I mean even Conor right the Nate fight is a bad example because that was the first time he was in a fight in the UFC and and he didn't like it the second time he did better but the same thing with Chad it's a little bit of a fight he was in with Mendes when he was on his back he did some work got back through his feet he wasn't so uncomfortable with with a dominant wrestler like that on top that he wasn't gonna be able to get back up yeah well Conor is is definitely evolving you know you could definitely tell that he's uh did like especially his approach to the second Nate Diaz fight he fought that fight very smart and he survived some moments where it looks like he was gassing out or at least you got that opportunity to reset if he wasn't gassing out he's definitely diminished but he managed it he managed it much better than the first time because I mean when he got in trouble that first time yeah he did try to change the game but when it wasn't in his favor it was like I kind of want out of here this spirit I mean as a fighter I look at that and I'm like his spirit kind of broke there but he asked for that fight again and then he did it again and he did run into some trouble and he improved he fought through it the second time he didn't he wasn't like oh this is a real fight now I gotta get out of here no he was like I'm staying right here so I'm excited to see that Conor fight Eddie because I mean yeah Nate is the same kind of guy he's not gonna worry about those kind of things but like Eddie is a different beast Eddie's that Philly beast he's a savage so I want to see I want to see them get into a fight like it easily happen - it could easily happen Eddie opera is the fucking Savage yeah he really is he wants that Rafael dos Anjos stoppage holy shit the combination he hit him with I mean and the the this the sheer amount of punches he threw the barrage that it took to put him away I mean he had some fuckin serious endurance to press the pace like that that's the one thing that Conor has been struggling with right yeah yeah with that pace and endurance and and Eddie has the power to put that pace on and when when Nate gets him tired or gets him hurt on his feet he's got that power and it's not as dynamic he's he's a very strong guy - look he's a very strong guy for 155 I'm curious actually to see what Connor looks like at 55 because right we haven't seen him there in the UFC we've seen 45 and you've seen him cut no wait and wait like 169 I think he weighed against Nate it would be interesting to see what does Connor look like when he's at 155 I mean that might be the perfect weight for him it's an entirely possible we might see a better McGregor at 155 I think that's the deepest division yeah I think it has been for the longest time and that if anybody dominates that division like RDA did it for a little look dominant for a little bit um even coming up to the title fight he looked like he was gonna hold on to that for a while um but everybody they're so close everybody at that weight class is so close so if somebody does it what about nurmagomedov because he rag-dolled everybody he's gotten in there with that's the one guy you can't say it's close with because everybody he's got ahold of he's beating the fuck out of that guys special at that office special that's true I like I like that guy because what you said he's special right and when you see that special thing then I guess people kind of get lost in the void when everybody's close to being just as good as each other then you kind of just fight to get just a little bit better than the other guy just a little bit better than the other I just got to be better than him but then when you get the John Jones that comes into the arena and he's she's leaps and bounds ahead of everybody else then you realize there's a bigger gap and guys start closing that right like Alice a link Alexandre Gusterson I mean he always fights at that level especially when he's in a title fight but I don't know if John Jones didn't exist if he would rise to that occasion hmm no I mean hmm so somebody's got to show up in the lightweight division at some point like that to to make people raise their level because guys right now which is the deepest and toughest division but guys are so close and maybe tomorrow matter of is that guy hmm well he certainly has been in when it comes to grappling like what he did to dos Anjos was it was pretty stunning you know because I was like man dos Anjos is a legit Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt super strong guy really good on the ground and it just seemed like nurmagomedov just got a hold of them and just did whatever the fuck you wanted to once he got him on the ground just throws dudes around it's almost like he's built different but he doesn't you know like if Gleason T bow was doing that to dudes I'd go I that make sense look at that fuckin guy but when nurmagomedov does it it's not necessarily just some overwhelming physical attribute it's his technique and his aggression just just super fuckin aggressive and tight with his grappling and his positioning his ground-and-pound is horrific he's a scary dude man he doesn't he doesn't even have to think about the way he does those moves I remember when you said that when you say rag dolling people are da rd8 took that shot on him and he's in the third and he hit him with it ooh tamata basically from the over hook Whizzer and tripped him forcing it and that's not easy throw to hit and especially from that range it didn't look like it was gonna happen but he does it to the guy who goes on and become the world champion that way and then dominates other guys at that weight class yeah like that guy special man I want to see want to see him improve his stand up and get and get and just get better I want to see him do things like DJ is you know just working on his weaknesses and cuz I mean that guy would never lose imagine if he had DJ's MMA IQ and skill set but his rest went with his ret what his wrestling and ground is now like who's beating that guy I would send that guy to fight wars for me yeah man look he's here AG dolls dudes in a very unusual way do every now and then a guy will come up like that that can do that and he does it with like this intensity and aggression like Demian Maia ragdolls a lot of people too especially lately he gets a hold of guys like you did with Rick story but he's doing it in like this technical squeezy way you know when Norma Granof gets all the dudes it's just smash everything smash he's driving you into the ground smashing you into the ground and smashing when you're on top of you Demian Maia is just constricting he's like moving into position and he's slowly closing you off and he's gonna choke you it's a totally different kind of domination but then I don't know if it's entirely the fairest comparison because Damien is obviously for a much longer career and he fought at 185 and he fought again it's against Anderson he got knocked out by Nate he's had a lot of ups and downs in the UFC Jake Shields beat him people forget that Jake Shields essentially out grappled him but never come in off good luck good luck helped grapple in that dude good luck good but what's his was it takedown percentage like two it's probably a million percent I mean it's done everybody but the other thing about nurmagomedov is then he gets injured a lot yeah and you got a wonder is it because of that insane fucking aggressive style of his that so makes it so fun to watch them is that like you're kind of redlining your body too much probably yeah right yeah yeah I mean you got a rest right you gotta feel up you can't always be on yeah but I mean can a guide like a Demian Maia who trains very technically I mean obviously he wrestles and he does like a lot of chaotic movements as well but probably not nearly with the kind of intensity that Nurik meant off does you got a wonder like that style is obviously super effective and very fucking devastating and fun to watch but I wonder if preparing for that style and executing that style is almost like ultimately too much on your joints too much on your body I guess the question would be then is can he be no Magomedov without that style right like does he have the skill to translate that to slowing it down and and turning the volume down [Music]
