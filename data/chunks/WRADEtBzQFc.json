hello freak bitches when all that shit went down with Chris Kyle and the fan when he said that he punched you in a bar yeah you sued the family like no I didn't well I didn't choose fancied him rather excuse me i shooed him and he died and then the chute automatically goes to his estate that's the way the legal works she was never in any jeopardy because in any writers contract you have insurance from the publisher so it's me a poor trade and I became the villain going after the widow and the kids exactly that's the biggest lie it was a big insurance company that's covering the whole thing they're not out of pammi and they won't be out of pan but you had to explain that I'm sure over and over no I couldn't explain it that's the tie the trial got overturned because the insurance came out so it's okay to lie in court but if the truth comes out you can get a new trial the insurance came out what does that mean in court you're not allowed to say that insurance is paying for everything even though it's the truth you're not allowed to say that in court so what happens when you say it in court well it came out and the judge allowed it to a limited degree and then the appeals court ruled that the judge shouldn't have did that because having the judge say that it sways people wonderful gentle against the insurance company yeah because insurance company even even though the other side is doing what's called poor mouthing they're getting up and saying it's taxing them financially and lying the truth is insurance is paying for all of it don't get up and lie about it so the other side was saying this is going to devastate our family a reality though yeah trying to influence these and and in this case let me state this how overwhelming must the evidence of been for the jury to go against the grieving widow of the dead war veteran yeah it must be pretty overwhelming the evidence was overwhelming the the jury went from they came for me they said he was lied this didn't happen and we rewarding why do you think he did that did you know him no you didn't no he mean I didn't know even how he was how the thing happened we were there on the same night we were at McPeake cuz I was there for a graduation of class 258 I'm class 58 it's traditionally every hundred classes if you can you come back to the graduation so class 258 was graduating the next day on Friday I came out along with my teammates from class 58 to attend that graduation the next day so why would I say bad things about the seals if I'm there that's what he said he punched me for well tell me cuz I people don't know what we're talking about it's probably probably a lot of people listen to this have no idea what we're talking about so let me just fill him in real quick right the the book American sniper the movie with Bradley Cooper was just giant hit movie very patriotic movie about a guy was one of the most successful snipers in US history right a very successful warrior Navy SEAL war hero everybody loved him then he goes on the Opie and Anthony show and he says that he punched you out well there's a chapter in his book yes where he writes that he called me scruff face yeah and he said that I said seals deserve to die that in other words she accused me of treason yes and I was out there for a seal graduation if I felt that way about my old unit why would I be attending so he wrote in the book he gave you a nickname in the book scruff face whoever I mean he might not have even when he wrote it in the book he might not have even thought that he's gonna give that to you I mean who knows what was going on my thought was at the time I was trying to wrap my head around why anybody would do this and I was thinking well maybe he's just trying to generate as much controversy as possible to generate as much income as possible from his book and it just got out of hand I don't I mean I was trying to put it together because there was a couple other fabrications right there was a shooting at a gas station that never took place yeah and and he said that he during Katrina he was on the dome and shot people who were looting yeah that was the I mean because that's murder yeah and he also lied about his medals the Navy had to come out and correct he said he had two silver stars and five Bronze Stars he had one Silver Star and three bronze stars so he lied about three medals well that's it said one in three is impressive enough exactly yeah exactly and then they try to give him an excuse saying well he was confused no you're not when you get a medal like that it's like graduating from college they give you a certificate that puts on your wall if you win the bronze star or the silver star but as of as in seal yourself and if me under the bus what does that feel like to you because reason but this is obviously this is something that's very near and dear to your heart who hugely he has made it to where I can't go to a reunion anymore there were a hundred and seventy seals that wanted me kicked out of the UDT SEAL Association over his lie and the lies of his buddies who came up and tried to testify for him so what it got embarrassing his in the trial said that it actually happened no they couldn't say it but they tried to say everything else to make it seem like it did well how the hell they do that well because they dance around the questions and the lawyer ring and well you have to piece together there wasn't one witness that saw me get hit and there wasn't one witness that heard me say anything's he attributed to me and weren't you visible the next day yeah we hit first no pie photographs that night then posing for pictures with me if I had said all this stuff why would they have take pictures with me what does that feel like when someone just fucking lies horrible and and when lies about a terrible terrible and what's worse about it is the media jumps on it and convicts me of it because why they broke the story when I went off the grid Mexico where I couldn't even come back so they broke the story do you think they knew then you started believe it but weren't what didn't it happen on the Opie and Anthony show yeah but I don't think that was planned because I know those guys they are but they're but was the whole while they also did it he did it that day Riley later that afternoon so he once he named you he just started naming you every oh yeah then it went viral it went viral and everyone convicted me because they said well this Iraq war veteran would lie really I just watched oh well let me tell you all that it's destroyed my life I can't get hired for a job during my trial after it was over guess what happened 34 major media conglomerates entered the the trial with that amaz amma see they call it or whatever of influencing the Court of Appeals to overturn my verdict and they did it 34 media conglomerates the New York Times The Washington Post all of these media conglomerates appeal to the Court of Appeals to overturn my verdict but why because I won on think something called unjust enrichment they want the ability to be able to defame you and profit from it in other words I'll put it what they had what these judges accommodated them with there's going to be another trial they've ordered a new trial so I got to go through it again but I'm glad because when it comes out to juries and to judges find Kyle guilty who's not going to believe it then and but the point is they they've ordered a new trial they've they do out the whole verdict of the jury the federal judge who wrote substantial evidence supporting the jury's verdict they did all that and they violated their own rules a 76 year rule here's what it states if because it happened during summation where the judge allowed it in the my attorney it ended up four questions in an 11 day trial and a half a page of a 20-page summary and it was overturned on that and they overturned it because they felt that was undue influence on the jury that they found out that insurance was paying for everything so is that one factor well and here's the deal if the rule state that if in final argument they say something you must object you must object so the trial lawyer has a chance to rule during final argument and the jury has a chance to hear the ruling they never objected so they must object to undue influence because of the fact that it was no either way they never wait they never objected the jury was dismissed at 11:58 at 12:02 they then objected the judge overruled them and we were done with it well these two judges Reilly and Shepard have now overturned the case on something that was never objected to in trial they objected to it so they overturned the jury and the federal judge then they also overturned my unjust enrichment claim because the media didn't want it what they've allowed now is the media can defame you and profit from it and you can't get any of their profits in no matter how they harm you well that's the equivalent of if you went out and robbed the bank and they caught you and they sentence you to two years in prison for the bank robbery but when you get out you get to keep all the money you took so that's in this particular one yeah talk about this particular which will now be the standard as they've ruled that way they now make it to where you can profit from wrongdoing because of this case yep you see that this is such a touchy case because it's so indicative of the complications of people because people are not simple it's really very touchy he lied he did lie but he has room to be with his lie that but that's not what I'm saying what's complicated is he's also the subject of this gigantic movie and this symbol of patriotism where so many people will say Chris Kyle rest in peace so many people would have I saw a cloud that was someone took a photo in the cloud that's on a cloud that's a Chris Chris Kyle it'll look like a sniper in the cloud unless it's Chris Kyle guiding the guarding the skies like it became a meme I mean he became this thing where it wasn't he was a representative of the the brave military like the the portrayal but honestly the betrayal that Bradley Cooper played in that movie that movie was so simplistic and so it was it was like a brat of a Joseph koke our hero's journey had I not gone to court that would have been in the movie really I had to stop it they were gonna have him punch you in the movie well for the book holy shit and I had to stop it because you know when we were when we were in trial you know what they tried to do to diminish my role because when they knew they were going to lose their lawyer got me on the stand and he said mr. Ventura he said would it surprise you to know that the first draft of the movie doesn't have you in it trying to prove how insignificant my would say the first draft of the movie I mean shit well the first draft is that yeah but so what if the second draft has you in it though I set here's what my response I said no that wouldn't surprise me at all because I said we've sent two letters to Warner Brothers warning them that if I'm indeed in in this movie they will be next to be sued so we put Warner Brothers on notice that if this chapters included in your movie you will get sued next and you know people out here they don't want to step into a lawsuit that's the only thing that kept me from being punched out in that movie and portrayed me as a villain in that frickin movie I just I'm just a villain way more than a villain yeah right I mean that is insane it is insane because what's what's crazy to me and what's complicated about this is that there are thousands and thousands of brave men and women who risked their lives sacrifice their lives and this guy becomes this this way your head when where is where he rises above including me including you yes very important but he rises above all this and becomes this icon for yes this iconic figure that you can't tarnish and then the truth is irrelevant and they're willing sacrifice people like you and the truth just for this overall image of patriotism yep it's crazy what a crazy place that must have been for you still is in fact do you know that this person that I told you about with the seizures the seizure disorder started right after this I'm sure that a seizure sign doctor Osman doctors have said seizures can be caused by stress so I hold Chris Kyle directly responsible for the seizure disorder also that I had to face that marijuana cured did you ever communicate with him face to face only once at the first when we first and June I didn't even know who he was and then at in June of 2012 after the book came out in January we had a settlement conference where he kept saying that if he met me in person we could work it out so at this conference we agreed I would meet him in a room the judge in the corner and just ski and I like you and I are here we sat down in the room and I looked him right in the face and I said why did you do this you never punched me he looked me back and said yes I did I turned to the judge I said there's no need to go any farther I said if he's not going to admit it didn't happen face to face one on one and I challenged his courage because yeah he had the courage to go to Iraq he had the courage to shoot all these people but he didn't have the courage to tell the truth did he what a bizarre moment that must have been sitting across from that guy yeah and he looked at me and said yes I did what was the look in his face I believe and I'm not a doctor but I've done some studying I think he was a sociopath sociopaths can lie and hold a straight face and they lie to the point where they believe their own lie how bizarre is it that this iconic figure well and then look how he died yeah well he had no training in post-traumatic stress he's not medical and yet he's taking this marine to a gun range who's suffering from post-traumatic stress wouldn't common sense tell you not to put a weapon in the hands of someone suffering from post-traumatic stress I think everyone if he's not telling the manic stresses what if and what do they tell him to man up why would you put a weapon in somebody's hands who's suffering from post-traumatic stress when you have no medical training how is quiet I'd to treat this guy while I would assume it'll be based on his own post-traumatic stress but he didn't have it he didn't have it at all now he was never treated for it he may have had it maybe that's why he did what he did I don't know God what a crazy place to be but but the for me it's like I've been accused of something I didn't do I don't even know the guy never I may have met him that night briefly well Jason I died obviously didn't get a one one millionth of a percent of the amount of hate that you did but just read I got read off September 11th of this year I was in New York doing this book tour and I got read off in a hotel lobby over this what does that mean read off a guy yelled and screamed at me in front of the entire hotel lobby Jesus Christ that's what I live with now and I haven't been damaged my reputation isn't damaged over something I never did what I was going to say is I obviously haven't experienced one one-millionth of the hate that you have but I read we've read this article on the air we were trying to figure out what happened when your case was going on and so we read this article that was I don't know was in the New York Times see if you could find the article detailing all the various lies oh that's the new yorker magazine yorker yorker may they did an investigation of him but it's stunning and just reading that the the fucking amount of hate tweets and facebook tweets and you fucking coward and you this and you that I'm like hey I didn't write it okay I'm just trying to figure out what the fuck is going on if someone puts something like that in the New Yorker with verified claims I mean everything's verified like what they were saying that he said and what actually had happened was all verified it's very very very confusing that somehow another dis slipped through the cracks and that this became their iconic figure again not discounting along with you the thousands and thousands of patriotic Americans at risk their lives and he is - nobody's denying he wasn't a great sniper nobody's denying he didn't do his job I've never denied that from him or said that about him he may be the best I don't know I'll still put my money on Carlos Hathcock though the Marine as being the best sniper especially now but uh but uh he did his job and he did it well but why did he have to take an old veteran that would be like me taking a world war two guy and throwing him under the bus why the fuck would he choose you because I had Fame he I think he got jealous that night we're at the bar because everyone crowded around and wanted their picture with me Wow I don't know he'll never be around to answer it I'd love to know why he picked out me I think cuz I'm probably the most famous maybe or I developed to be the most famous see leather dick Marcinko the Rogue Warrior Green Oaks yeah read his books well he's a friend of mine Richard Marcinko when I sat down and you're talking to this guy how much time were you actually in the room with him Oh couple of minutes was all the minute the minute he looked me in the eye and said I sure did hit you I turned to the judge said we got nothing more to talk about you didn't want I was neither offered him I said if you will walk out to be with the press and admit you fabricated this story I will forgive you in front of the press and we will go on with our lives he would not do it he did not have the courage to stand up and tell the truth it takes a lot of courage to admit you lied about something that massive I mean this isn't lying about speeding right this is this is a massive task what about ruining my life ruining my reputation ruining my wife's life Rui I lost my conspiracy theories show because of it really I can't get hired right now I can't get a job my last job was on the internet that or a TV because the owners Carlos Slim from Mexico from that you know who I'm hired you know who I work for now the Russians Russian TV artis the only people that will hire me because 34 media conglomerates entered this case to overturn me you think they're gonna hire me now explain that why do you think they did that do you think they did that because if they overturn your case if they can somehow or another because they don't want is ready fact-check but is that it or is that discrediting you in public that was a gigantic hit movie but if they dis if they can discredit you it makes that movie still valuable not only that it stops me from running for president don't and if they can discredit me [Music] you
