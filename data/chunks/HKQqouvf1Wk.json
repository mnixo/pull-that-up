trained my day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day now there's so much going on supplements now you have to make sure you put in the research and investigation speaking on your body I pokken did you see that picture of Travis Brown's finger knuckle deep into from Reese over dooms eyeball he didn't even say anything in the fight right did for Doom I don't remember senior doom I call home anything on that I don't remember but I did see that jump uh that jump psychic in the beginning is crazy you get the end on his trainer like the reason the cool all right there was cuckoo twas the cool fight well it was it was a bomber to me to see Travis fight like that because I remember Travis earlier in his career was just a look at that picture that is creepy fucking insane Esther Esther Lin from all elbows on Instagram put this picture up and she's an MMA photographer she takes awesome pictures mm picture and this is insane I mean it is literally knuckle deep in his eyeball it just it's hard to look at man it's just oh my second knuckle about to write business though it's like his fingers disappeared in the eyeball I don't remember him stopping or saying I poked her anything I don't remember either let's focus though there was a bad one earlier in the night with jimmy rivera and Uriah yeah that was a bad one and Jimmy really after the fights that he couldn't see so still couldn't see he's like he said he couldn't tell what color things were out of his right eye hmm yeah fucking eye pokes man pride gloves huh get a raise on the gloves a little bit of a Carter in there that open all the way sorry no I think you're right most of the time this is what I do obsess about martial arts to making things better someone's got to do something because the way things are going we're just so many guys are getting eye gouge so many guys getting damaged eyeballs it's just it's not worth it man and it seems like we're waiting for something terrible to happen like look at Michael Bisping yeah yeah I don't know Bisping's came from a kick though I feel like it might have come from Vito's kick was it that wasn't in practice I don't know do you think was in practice I think he I think he detached his Retton a couple times so I think that's why he's the way it is now I think he's heard multiple times and was kind of where because it's not completely fixed I think they fix it enough to where he can fight and then when he's done fighting the prefixes I completely see like what they did is they stuck oil in his eye I don't understand it but one of his eyeballs apparently has oil in it that's protecting the retina so that's why one of his eyeballs is black like oh yeah I was wondering what was going on sighs that's why yeah one is black and one is his original eye car which I'm not sure what it is but it's very strange-looking but that's just he's a fucking Savage I mean he's eating we consider retiring is like yeah stick some oil in there look at going whatever I can do put an eye patch on this dude's gotta get back to the gym mate he does push it that guy comes to fight each and every time and a mole yes sir Michael Bisping is the middleweight champ in the world and who saw that coming he did he did I seen that opening an egg in a Luke Rockhold to Instagram videos leading up to the fight I've seen the same thing his trainer saw really yeah he was leading it back he was telling me week before the fight that thinks he was doing while he's hitting mitts dropping his right hand all the time with his left cross and can lean him back and kind of shoulder rolling and whatnot and Dwayne called it out couple weeks before the fight that he saw openings you know you didn't say he's gonna get knocked out with a buddy saw some openings there you know open is there I mean that's it is pretty simple you can see where the openings are on that one for sure and I remember after Bisping caught him and it's trying to point at him and not quite sure what he said left but he was for sure saying I could see I told you I told you like that yeah so they said well I was very fellow yes yeah he he's a good boxing coach he understands the game I got respect for that guy but it's cool to see something you've trained multiple times come out and actually work and then win the fight and then the title fight hmm that's that's nice that's reward so that's what I wanted to bring up to you what did you think about the Travis Browne Fabricio Werdum fight where Travis called time like he got his finger jammed Fabricio threw a punch and Travis's Travis's finger apparently broke and there's some photos of it now online it was it's fuckin nasty like shows you how tough Travis is that he continued with his finger smashed and it was a compound fracture with the bone broke through the skin well that's one picture but there's some even better ones that he released today well you could see it after the fight it was a nasty break but so it was a weird thing were Fabricio through this punch and he threw like one of those Chuck Liddell style over hands that come over the top up and it landed on the fingers of Travis and snapped one of his finger so Travis calls time what you really can't do is like my fingers fucked I've calls time I can't like oh I'll scroll up though and you see it the actual opening yeah here comes the boom he's this time out right yeah Kevin James edited time so he can't I'll do that mr. gets Marie Smith did they stop it oh sorry oh oh that's right you did that boss you did that in a fight oh yeah like a yeah but Maurice no I did I like that yeah I kicked him in the head and then I got excited one to give him another kick in that but I slip and I fall on the ground and Maurice wants to jump on top of me and I put my head up I say wait and he stops and I'm getting up and I good thank you that's composure that's not just a trick yeah you know I not I want to help very funny if anybody awesome with a Jason de Lucia I dropped it with his liver shot right and then I walked over to me you see what I'm doing I stretch my arm above me and I wave with my hand and you see him looking up to my hand and then I live or kick him again I just put mine over say yeah look at this and I look he actually looked there that's alright that's good composure right we actually use that stuff all the time the bird the bird so there's master master Tong he's a my first striking coach at out you [Music]
