hmm is this static I'm hearing just in the headphones you hearing something yeah it's gone now anything live and work live and we're live for happy motherfucking New Year number one we used to think that the world's gonna end well I used to think the world was gonna end even at the license plate 2012 license plate I was convinced I was like those Mayans man they knew it I thought it was real for sure the computer thing remember that y2k yeah I thought that too yeah I stayed home for y2k paranoid I was too clock rolled over planes falling from the sky yeah everybody's worried about the whole grid shutting down right they wouldn't be able to get it up for months people would run out of food I was listening to art Bell a lot back then Oh cheers Cheers a new year happy ain't never done eight years of episodes eight years of episodes 2018 2018 doesn't sound like a real number it's one of those numbers you say it and you go oh yeah my guess yes you're right like 2018 that's like way too close to 2020 which is like space that's like the future it's like a movie you know like alien like what was when you watch the first alien one with Sigourney Weaver from the late 70s it was like 1979 what do you think the timeline was supposed to be he's probably 2001 because there's like a lot of movies like I think Blade Runner was something like 2017 or something like that I want to say I don't remember but I want to say Blade Runner was like 2030 or so I was at that there's all the flying cars and shit number weren't there flying cars or am I thinking of Fifth Element no no there was flying cars cuz I remember the cars going through like the cool billboards and stuff and I confused my sci-fi movies a lot like old ones Blade Runner is 2018-2019 yeah oh my god that's insane that's a year from now that's wow that's weird that shows how slow it actually is technology you think it's fast it shows how bad movie writers aren't guessing I don't think it shows anything else okay so I think the guy who's been the best at predicting shit was like wasn't HG Wells really good I feel like HG Wells the science fiction author from I think he was from the 1800's HG Wells but I think he predicted a lot of shit that there's a particles of all the stuff you predicted oh really yeah the many futuristic predictions of HG Wells that came true all right let's see what we got here what did he do or and a hundred and fifty years ago phones email and television what is that real in men like God's in 1923 Welles invites readers to a futuristic utopia that's essentially Earth after thousands of years of progress in this alternate reality people communicate exclusively with wireless systems that employ a kind of commingling of voice mail and email like properties holy shit for in Utopia except by previous arrangement people do not talk together on the telephone he writes a message is sent to the station of the district in which the recipient is known to be and there it waits until he chooses to tap his accumulated messages whoa and any that one wishes to repeat can be repeated then he talks back to the sender's and dispatches any other messages he wishes the transmission is wireless how huh what I'd like to know if he did drugs back then like if he was doing mushrooms and yeah man I want to know he also imagined forms of true entertainment it says in when the sleeper wakes from 1899 the protagonist rouses from two centuries of slumber to a dystopian London in which citizens used wondrous forms of technology like the audiobook airplane and television yet suffer systemic oppression and social in what in the fuck man what the fuck HG Wells lasers dude how is he so good it's probably mushrooms I mean we'll think of something that hasn't been invented in a hundred years now what would you invent like well you know what here's our problem it's I think it's almost impossible once you know something exists to imagine a world in which it didn't exist see you and I are unique because we're old as fuck I'm older fucker than you but we remember when there was no internet I think we're the last of the people that are gonna remember what life is like when there's no internet yeah and what's next what's the thing that hasn't been invented that we'll remember we saw the first of like VR good question like having glasses always being well I think that magic leap shit that you know that you've seen that new headset that they are saying they're gonna eventually wind up selling you have a hip pack and you wear these goggles mm-hmm that seems like step one to me yeah Apple is putting all their money and AR instead of VR for that reason right that's what this is right this looks like Blade Runner yeah maybe that movie's not so far off the the one from Columbus Ohio Blade Runner Oh like maybe they're only off by a year ready player one ready player one have you seen the preview for that that's well pretty much this is exact same thing as right there but this is the Microsoft one well the difference is magically did he play that movie so magically biz not Microsoft which ones the Microsoft one that would be hololens bleep is the one that's in florida they went way away from everybody else so that they're not getting their technology compromised and these are the ones where they had that little dancer that dances on your hand okay so this is the really intense lifelike augmented reality yeah nobody knew what it was gonna look like they thought any prototype had a big giant backpack on and they finally got it down to this little puck this is the first time we're actually seeing what no this also might not be the final version it could be smaller could be a little bigger looks cool it looks very cool it looks like superhero cool yeah but the thing is is it it's so obvious that you're wearing it yeah they need to get rid of that part and integrate it into the headset there's like this hip part like wear it in public at least this this is probably like a home work type thing mmm wherever you'd use a personal computer I feel like we're looking at the seed of a future thing that's gonna eat us I'm looking at that I'm like that that is exactly how it starts the electronics cling to the outside and become inseparable and then slowly they work their way into the organism itself to the inside the organism will accept symbiosis as long as the electronics stay on the outside but if it goes inside like if the only way to use your cell phone was to stick it in your ass right the only way it works we have a new cell phone and it works but you know all you have to just stick it in your ass and then just carry it around with you and you make calls of your mind and it's a flip yeah we would say no way we can't do it but as long as the electronics from the outside like I said dude they're gonna give you a helmet you know the electronics are gonna go right in your eyes you're gonna see some shit that's not there you're like okay we're both clothing tech is the future there's even I think Levi's and Microsoft or Google teamed up and they're they're trying to do a jacket like a tech jack or you just look at your jacket and read texts and stuff off the sleeve and stuff imagine having a like a shirt and going like today I want a purple shirt today I want a blue shirt or you're getting text messages pop up on your shirt or if there's a lost child the child's face is on everybody's shirt fuck I think wearable clothing is gonna be pretty big soon yeah especially if you could like if you could get your arm like if it actually could open up like where it looks like a screen yeah or if we can get that good where there's no benefit like and nobody wants a cell phone with a shitty screen right right yeah because like that isn't that like the big debate now they all look amazing to me because I'm going blind say but the if I look at like the iPhone X versus the Google pixel - Excel versus I'm they all look really good yeah it's more like brightness now to me it's like oh this one seems brighter I guess they all look really good they all look amazing I mean we're really nipping and which is good just shows you how good things are but could you ever reproduce that on your sleeve yeah they already have that perfect well like like the technology's not a hundred percent there but they'd already have bendable LCDs right and like stuff like that but the thing is having it feel like clothing instead of like this big chunk that's on your shirt like those things you see at the mall but I like I had this I was talking to Gina a speed weed about this and the idea of having a hat imagine a hat where you can have any logo you want in your hat you could change it any day and then you could also have it so it just moves or something like if it's that Nike swoosh you see like the smoke coming out of that you know how cool would that be just and it's weird that we don't see that as a normal thing yet because it seems like that's already there you can do that hat right now probably I have a little 3G connection so you can download things on it you know using the little thing on the top of the Hat yeah you probably could but you probably could I mean what anything that you can imagine in the future is probably going to be possible like anything anything you can imagine I don't think there's going to be a time in our lifetime or where change is gonna happen as quickly as it's happening now what about shoes where where you could just had like instead of walking your shoes just roll you know like like kind of lie the long ride yeah isn't that what I was always goofing around about the aliens that what aliens are is what we imagine is us in the future and maybe that's what they really are maybe that they're time travelers because if you had to think like if you go back and look at ancient like Australia Pittacus you ever see like a depiction of Australia Pittacus it's like this weird sort of half-human monkey things like one of the first people and if you go back and look at that and then you look at a regular person today that maybe you know it takes a spin class you know go see if they go to the one where he's standing up there's some pictures of what they think they would have looked like it's weird because there is people that look kind of like these people you sure yeah just see them once more some people that are pretty hairy too I mean they think there's there's all sorts of different kinds of people too that's another thing that we forget there was a bunch of different kinds of people that died off but the idea is all these people right all these different kinds of little people they eventually evolved to be human right if they stay alive they get to a point well what happens if you pass the human thing do you just stop at human I don't think you could stop at human this is not perfect this is not perfect this is better it's better than you know killing each other with rocks in the trees it's better than that but it's definitely we're getting better at this it's obvious we're getting better at being people collectively so like where does it go does it go - we just move everything with our brains and our heads are that big robot and we fuck up the environment so bad that we need sunglasses permanently on the outside and that's what those alien the black eyes so we just fixed it we just give you a fake lens your skin's like bulletproof do you move everything in with your brain nobody needs a mouth anymore no sex organs it got too complicated gender this is the year like this is the machines confused us and got us to the point where they could deliver orgasms through like little little injections in the back your brain you just give them way more intense orgasms and you would ever get jerking off or having sex and so everybody just stopped having sex and your dicks and vaginas just sure they just sealed up we figured out food to the point where there's no more waste so no one has to shit we just nailed that's perfect balance no one's ever overweight so they have sex and demolition man they put those headsets on and sit across from each other oh yeah they had their feet in the water he's like no water no that's not water it looks like water it's where they'd girl jerks into that's so strange that's how they had sex you know that's probably gonna be better we gave it this physical thing we gave it a shot it's too complicated the food thing makes the most sense we are probably gonna run out of food in having like the future of food is gonna be really weird where it's just gonna be like almost like a brick like a vitamin well there's my steak you know there's yeah man right the future of food like when they're you know there was some article a real recent but I think maybe even today that was talking about their progress in synthetic meat to be able to just make meat in laboratory which is whoo that's a game-changer don't they already have it we can buy it now I feel like yeah I wasn't reading something other day when you talked about it fat burger has the impossible burger yeah it's oh but that's a plant-based meat yeah that's not but that's done a lot mate no no that's um they've had those for a while people who are vegan who used to like cheeseburgers apparently say that this works that you could you can literally they they look but there's some smart people out there they figure out a way to make things taste different than what they really are there's a bunch of vegan cheese's and shit that are really good but that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about lab-created meat actual meat that they're somehow or another thing there's some cloning process or something yeah I saw something about the other day and where it's they're pretty much there if not completed with it I don't know that's that if they can do that that's fine I would if it tastes the same I would go with the lab created me lab created meat it's probably better for you Jesus I just well I just imagining like you know what I'm imagining power outage a warehouse filled with lab-created meat stuck in the pipes do you think the expiration date is on a lab created me forever yeah they just engineer with the right bacteria so I could stay on the Shelf indefinitely however making a mistake that the first time the grocery store had these things called I don't complete meals I don't know what the fuck it's called but there's like meat like a biscuits and gravy but not in the cold section not in the hot section and you barely had to heat it up it was just like kind of ready to go meals yeah me my friend ate it I think we both got sick as fuck they're so disgusting but I mean they're still out there this was seven years ago it's like those little meals for kids that aren't really food it's as little jables Lunchables those things are the worse for people that's native food yeah cheese things you stick a cracker in yeah oh oh those are so gross some of them some some somebody must have a good one by now good little like Starbucks sounds like a decent little snack pack right don't they have one with like celery and beets and shit yeah they have my all this stuff Starbucks is pretty good AMC movie theaters has waffles and chicken now did you know that that's amazing but I think the healthy option thing is because people demand it right because there's a bit why wouldn't they have it is like there's there's money in it yeah I've got a Starbucks sometimes if you're trying to not take in too much sugar or something like that you look at all that stuff and like god damn it it's gotta be something here for me what's here for me like you got all your tasty eyesight options right like those cake pops like might just go off the reservation get a fucking cake pop right it's like weird like they're really they're selling sugar just as much as they're selling coffee which is great have you had the band's like bagels the bagel balls heard the romaine they're amazing they used to like their chocolate croissants but then I found the coffee beans chocolate croissants to be more delectable so if I was gonna go off I go to the coffee bean don't mess with that I don't mess with Starbucks you have a relationship with Starbucks it's just right next door every time I get a coffee bean though when you get used to it a certain taste of coffee even if the coffee's better it's really hard to go like that's not an iced coffee in my head and iced coffee Starbucks iced coffee this is just like some other bullshit like I'm at the Denny's the other day maybe the best coffee I've had in a long time and you can't buy that anywhere you have to go to Denny's really yeah they don't sell Denny's coffee now I was looking for a cake up for it you know they little Couric's cups bacon Denny's is uh that's probably like the biggest breakfast chain ever right yeah it's gotta be it's like IHOP and Denny's those are the two you could have there's like a standard you can get like there's a balance between how delicious it is how cheap it is you got to be real careful with that balance you know like it's a different concept than a regular restaurant like a regular restaurant but it is a regular restaurant right I mean I hops a fucking regular restaurant and burger there the other day but even if you eat there you like even if you eat healthy they're like I fucked up with the I alright cuz everything is so delicious you looking at whipped cream on top of shit in the menu and those maraschino cherries you're like oh Jesus this is a high hop and then you have that row of syrup already on your table like I think I want to add blueberry taste to it if you're gonna just go off I hops the spot to go off write a story yeah yeah South Carolina man hilariously cooks himself breakfast at Waffle House while employee sleeps oh my god that's funny yeah he's taking pictures the guy is just asleep in the corner oh my god oh my god is that illegal could those guys get in trouble for that I mean taking the pictures and incriminating yourself probably not the smartest move them putting them online but probably not oh that's a good question it's like a no harm no foul kind of thing I think no harm no foul who got hurt in this situation I wonder if he put money down now he said he came back says he came back the next day and gave a $5 tip Wow one employee working a whole awful house what if what if like ten people walk in 20 people walk in that seems weird that seems ridiculous I hate waffle waffle houses are amazing you like my outfit yeah man if you're on the road it's like 3 o'clock in the morning like the greatest things that have ever existed if you're on the road like let's pick up some weird spot in South Carolina or something like that let's go see Jesus that was just a straight-up guess all the waffle houses in Ohio were like connected to strip clubs so I always considered it being like gross food because yeah man I'm we've probably been to about 10 of those on the road yeah they're always like a good option it's also 24 hours so yeah that's right that's why it's so crazy that's why it gets weird waffle houses get weird 3:00 a.m. New Year's Eve awful house all it takes is one crazy person walk in guy Fiera I just had to close his restaurant you say that with glee why do you gotta support your own no I'm just saying that that's that that went fast you know all the fury is a he's a funny guy yeah I like how he where I think people that wear their sunglasses backwards on their neck but you know what I don't get with him as why so many people get right I guess they don't like that he spikes his hair they don't what is it that they don't like he's just easy target on them I mean he seems nice I met him once he was nice I mean I don't care if he likes to wear his hair like that it's like a Don King thing am i mad at Don King he can't change his look that's what he's known for is it racist being a white guy with blond hair spikes his hair up and people just automatically assume you're a douche is that racist I got a Nickelback thing like people are really hate I mean they probably a little bit but I wear my hair like that sometimes Billy Corgan I don't know if he was trolling or not I don't think he was he was talking to me about how good he thinks Nickelback is I think Nickelback has some fucking good songs I do what I do but so I know the first thing the main problem people had man I'd listen I enjoy the way that Rockstar song sounds I know that sort of a song that's been covered you know if that sted style of song has been covered a few times right but I like that one I mean I like the Cypress Hill one better remember so if you want to be a rock star you know it's the same thing it's the same thing yeah it's the same thing it's like there's a style of song of like describing what it's the lifestyle of a rock star the only problem with the Nickelback song is that it had been done before because if it hadn't been done before they did a really job covering that subject like they're their take on it was was good it was very polished maybe too polished for some people like shit raw we like to hear that Janis Joplin growl right we like to hear Amy Winehouse is something we like about that raw shit just to remind us remind us you're just like us that's the problem I think some musicians have with Nickelback they're sort of considered at least they were and what's called like an in the box type of band Lee's for recording purposes aren't they Canadian yeah that's it that's all it is Canadians are so nice you don't believe them just they would record no no effects on their sounds on their guitar for instance no distortion no delay they record literally putting the guitar right into this board kind of and it record this real weird electronic sound that you could manipulate completely improve to later changing everything about it mmm they were like one of the first bands that got popular doing that I think and so that's sort of like I'm sure traditional musicians had a big problem with it isn't Nickelback the band that every single one of their songs sound exactly the same that whiney yeah that guy not whining well I wouldn't say whiney I'd say it's poppy it's like very good pop music I mean try to be nice I don't I like a lot of their songs but I'm trying to be nice here look I understand if people would get upset that it's not their style of music you know there's people that like like really though they'll play something for you like they'll play The Beatles like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds you put on some headphones and listen to Lucy smoke a joint put on some headphones and listen to a song that was created by the first wave of British superstars that came to America in there on acid and they're saying about Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and it's it's amazing it's amazing do that right now you want us to do it right now just think I want I want to think about this for a second just imagine imagine what it was like back then imagine imagine being in like 1960 whatever the fuck it was when all this was going on what do you plan on last night I forgot I don't know how to say the word dear diary how do you say yeah oh dude there's so many good songs there's so many good songs now this is the thing these songs are better they're better than Nickelback but it's not mold but Nickelback is not bad saw that it's just if you want to compare Jimi Hendrix to the rest of the world the rest of the world is gonna suck a fat dick there's there's a guy that knew how to do it better than everybody else doesn't mean that doesn't mean Eric Clapton wasn't an amazing guitarist it means everybody always looks at Jimi Hendrix in a better way for whatever reason meant for whatever reason you know I'm sure there's people that would see it the opposite way doesn't mean Nickelback sucks like they would just word the Beatles you know that's like a I guess there's a different category between like you know the Beatles Led Zeppelin and Nickelback right I mean there is but maybe we should just relax I'll take two smash mouths over I mean maybe we should just relax like about everything I think we're picking we're looking for tribal enemies that don't exist you know just because you like to eat you know falafels and and you know like extra ketchup on your fries and I don't you know or you you like to go running and I like to take naps you know who cares this is this is my perspective in 2018 I think the more we can relax that we will have less confidence interpersonal conflict which often fuels extra personal conflict this 2018 let it go you can like dinkle back I told somebody that I like le King and they gave me like a side words face I'm like fuck you not even here that is you know who that is yeah you ever heard that song X's and O's dude she's badass accent her whole album is badass what is that uh what is that that album called do you call it an album anymore because it used to be it was an album and then you were an old man if you were calling it an album it's a CD bro then it stopped being a CD and became an album again I download I just had downloaded it what do you say do you say you say it's a now how do you remember what people would mock you if you said album because they'd be like you mean CD it's just CD now called a CD like okay okay there was like a phase where people got kunti about the distinctions between CDs and albums and then all of a sudden vinyl made a little come back during the CD era people decided that vinyl was how would you describe it Jamie what's the what's the difference Sheen the sound oh it's warmer you always say warmer yeah vinyls huge now yes so big like I went to a vinyl store the other day that was like being in a record store in the 70s like I was a vinyl well people are digging it man they get into it it's a tactile relationship with the music that's what Henry Rollins was explaining it to me and the way he describes it it's really intoxicating because he's such an addict to that kind of music and he has whole set up in his house were these crazy speakers that are like stupid expensive and he has this amazing record collection and you'll just sit there and play his records and he does a radio show I believe it's once a week is it once a week he does a radio show once a week where he picks the songs and he plays the music it's all his selections what is it on kr KCRW yeah so he's got these fucking nutty ass speakers man look at these things and he stands in front of these things and sounds I really enjoyed talking to him man he's a uniquely unusual person I always thought he was like I would I'm gonna be completely honest when he was a young guy and he did that beavis and butthead thing liar remember that beavis and butt-head it was hilarious dude he had an amazing song called I'm a liar you ever seen Rollins you don't know that song it was like one of his breakout hit songs Isaac connect number that he was super jacked that was in his full-on powerlifting days yes and I remember seeing him going this guy is like way too intense how is this a fucking singer in a band that guy looks like he wants to rip your fucking head clean off your body and just pull your guts through your neck hole he looked so crazy scary and I could never figure it out I was like that's so weird that this guy is a singer in my mind a singer had to be a certain type of person they had to be a Jon Bon Jovi or they had to be a Robert Plant they had it you know there was a style that you could be a singer and he was just this completely new weird thing this jacked-up power lifter covered in tattoos I was like whoa but when you meet him I mean maybe it's because I'm meeting him later in his life when he's mellowed and matured but he is one of the most fascinating guys I've ever talked to one of the most absolutely unique individuals like oh I never met one of you the guy is obsessed with productivity and work and creating obsessed with it his writing writes like a bunch of different publications constantly writing constantly traveling goes to places just gets on a plane flies over that spot lands with buys water and starts fucking meeting people doesn't know where the fuck he is it just puts himself in these weird positions and some of them like super dangerous fascinating guy man never met a guy like him I heard him on re spod cast one of the one of the main podcasts that he did would that really like fucking blew my mind was him describing all this travel that he does on re show because you know our he's a travel nut - so the two of them together it's like wow I think he probably was one of the inspirations or at least helped fuel the inspiration that re-add when he already took off for like four months I didn't know he was on our ease podcast that's a good good catch Ferrari it's an amazing episode I believe they were in Edinburgh I believe they were there for the Fringe Festival in Edinburgh and I think that our was performing and he he's gonna get mad I know he told me this story and I don't remember it you hear a lot of stories though I heard too many somehow or another someone set it up but it's a great podcast nonetheless however it transpired but Henry Rollins is here it is that's exactly what your name is skeptic tank - 77 yeah it's an awesome podcast I mean like a life changer like you listened to that podcast and his what he gets out of travel you go oh yeah why wasn't i looking at it that way like why was I just going to place is going up can you drink the water is this safe like what is this okay whereas he's going over there going out what do you do man what's going on like what do you people up to he's like really like going into uncharted territories all the time on a regular basis picks a spot in the map just goes it's like that's one of the things that I've always said about Ari I like people who just go for it you know like Ari Shaffir just goes for it takes it goes away Frank for months he just vanishes he goes for it with how he does comedy you know I go do comedy in China you know he just goes for it it would be funny if when he vanishes but he actually has another life that he doesn't tell anybody about looking family kids okay husband didn't he have an entire another life when you guys did a podcast together and re-did salvia on your podcast yeah and he the way he described it is like he I'm not conflating these right this is am i confusing this this is when it was the same he did it on your podcast yeah and then this was the salvia trip where he said that he lived like a whole life for like three months and there was something with water in a bus or something like that well there was he I'm sure he described it somewhere he felt like he had lived a whole life like four months a whole different life four months and then came back from that trip like it just happened he realized oh my god no I just took salvia they really got rid of salvia fast didn't they remember when that was legal you just buy it online and then to within like a year they just kind of took care of salvia is it what is little distinction legally for solve you know I don't know scheduling they went fast on that legal marijuana but Matt but dude salvia is way stronger than marijuana oh yeah this is what people didn't know people were going to their pot dealers and they're trying to you know get some good weed right you want to have a good experience salvia used to be for sale at head shops everywhere and it was one of the most blow out of your fucking mind psychedelics you could ever encounter I used to buy it careful times eighty concentrated 120 X 120 X geez it seems stronger I bet it's not legal you should I wonder if it shows what states they will ship to or if you try to buy it it tells you like hey this is illegal and it's legal in most parts of the world and here's here's the big problem with all these things I think all these things could be handled way better than they have been so people are going buck wild with them whether it's mushrooms or whether it's LSD or anything people left these important compounds in the hands of people that were willing take them illegally and that's where most of our data is coming from because they couldn't do any tests on anything everything was just scheduled one scheduled one but the people that tested it or they're all you know people willing to take mushrooms it's a lot of people did would just white-knuckle that shit to death me included at various times in my life he tried to bring me mushrooms I'd white-knuckle myself to death so it was the people that the only sampling size that we have from the benefits the people that were wild enough to do it like what if we had actual scientists studying the shit going hey maybe we took the stuff in like low doses we could evolve quicker like this really might be something there might be something legitimate to the idea that stoned ape theory is that humans discovered psilocybin mushrooms and that's why the brain grew like double its size over a period of two million years that's the the theater anything right mushrooms could have totally been in that mix with all the other stuff - all the other stuff the throwing arm hunting is a film on the naughty show podcast for an old desk wants to do oh he said what happened was I took a hit salvia but I didn't quite take a big enough hit or I didn't hold it long enough so it took me right to the edge of disappearing into my mind but I didn't quote it but it didn't quite get me through the barrier so I took another hit this time the hit was as big as I could possibly muster it was massive and I held it for a really long time that hit alone would have been enough to make me obliterate my consciousness but that hit coupled with the one from before that all that got me almost there put me in another place I was at a lake in the backyard of my childhood home but I wasn't me swimming there I was a new being who lived underwater it took me a little bit of time to learn how to breathe water but then I learned and I was there for a while I mean like months at least I estimate I was there anywhere from four months to two years I made friends I had a life all underwater at some point my new life I saw Sam Tripoli at the store at the shore of the lake so I swim up to him to investigate parentheses he was just sitting in the chair across from me in reality that's when they started pulling me back into this existence but what they didn't know was that I couldn't breathe air anymore I've forgotten how after breathing underwater for so long I had to relearn the experience of breathing they says man that was a good trip it looked hellish if you watch the video but what's important to understand is that the that the hellish part was not me wanting to leave my friends family and life in the lake it was just adjusting back to this reality that hurt but the months or years I was living there was some of the most beautiful and peaceful of my life oh shit are his brain broke look at the video and imagine that he lived there for four years it's totally different when you see I feel bad for getting him into drugs look here's now here's what the four years he went through you're allowed to play audio so this is a video that we're watching that all took place in Brian's apartment I think he's dead stop oh my god you had to shush people well it's like he's sure been part I didn't want him to freak out right good call say I'm triply shut your mouth who else is there Triple E in the world Triple A Jason Tebow Allison and maker SH maybe oh what a great time to trip those people staring at ya talking mad shit while you're blowing out of your mind into another dimension so I think probably people because this is this is something you got it it only works visually but if you see it visually it's fascinating so it's Ari Shaffir on salvia and it's on Bryan's is it on yours or it's yes so on red bands YouTube page Ari Shaffir on salvia yeah salvia is white never clear Ari salvia is why I never did DMT because I had too many like okay I'm too old for this I might break my brain moments that I'm like I don't need to do anymore yeah there's there's some weird weird drugs out there we're really really weird ones and part of the problem with like legal definitions for what what is and isn't legal there's like it's it's kind of weird and blurry like there was some stuff called five Meo dimethyltryptamine which is the most potent form of DMT and up until like the year 2000 and like you'd be able to order it online they would just send it to you it's legal just as not for human consumption deli I don't know what you're doing with it but here it is pure and you'd be able to get enough to blast yourself in the universe every day of your life until you're dead for like 50 bucks it was crazy it was crazy it was the Wild West because people didn't know what it was yet cuz they had made a distinction that N & dimethyltryptamine which is the one that gives you all the visual hallucinations that that was more illegal that was that was the mote that was a Schedule one drug that was but they had listed five methoxy dimethyltryptamine so this is in this weird state of limbo salvia they just missed it what that stuff the fuck out of here I can't believe it's mystical do this probably a shitload of those in the Amazon it's probably a shitload of things that are no I've never been discovered and you eat some fruit and you fucking go blast off into the center of the universe I bet I bet that I bet if we could allow if we all decided alright we're gonna leave let's let's half humans live everywhere except one really big spot no people can live in this one really big spot we got to manage like other kind of ecosystems in a more hands-off sort of a way because we're just so deep except for like the Congo and places like that but if there was like one country where everybody agreed all right let's just leave this leave the spot alone no one go in there let's see what happens let's see how nature evolves while we observe it with modern methods just like step back for a few hundred years just as a human project let's see what kind of shit grows in there if you just leave it alone cuz we're so fucking snippy snippy let me get in there and let me dig let me fucking cut these down and I'll plant new ones don't worry about it bro I'm gonna plant new ones do it I got this I cut down the forest and put some new ones in not saying that I'm not hypocritical sitting here in front of a wood desk you know not saying don't do it but I mean think of how weird that is just leave all that shit alone who knows what kind of weird symbiotic relationships we could have had with plants that might have easily been how they came up with ayahuasca in the first place they probably eaten a bunch of weird fucking plants and all those plants were talking with all those other plants and I'm like listen I know I know we can get your shit bumping way quicker we got to get these monkey people to figure out how to eat these mushrooms and turn into regular people imagine magic that's really what it was all along just grasses and leaves communicating to us through some nonverbal language and giving us this idea of how to do certain things and though all these things are all just designed to get us to eat the mushrooms we eat the mushrooms get to the point where we accelerate to the point we have enough brain power and enough people combined interacting with each other and sharing information that we can build artificial life and then that becomes the new thing or along the way we become the aliens we figure out how to use that CRISPR technology CRISPR technology you know what that isn't it's some new thing I've brought up on the podcast a lot so if you've heard it before I apologize but it's some sort of a I'm gonna butcher the definition again it's some sort of a genetic altering system that they're creating a gene changing system where they can do things to the human body potentially where they can alter genetics they can alter DNA it's very complicated and I'm doing a terrible job describing it what it is essentially let me for a dumb person like me really super smart people have figured out a way to change biology they might be able to turn genes on and off like for autism for Alzheimer's like weird weird genes that create birth defects or various illnesses that we've we've been able to figure out how to target they might that we identify rather they might be able to target those things they will shut things off turn things on and I think there was an article really recently saying that the original CRISPR is now even out of date and the new one is far superior they're just getting better at it they're gonna they shot some shit into some dude there was a guy who had a disease and it was I believe it was an incurable disease he was the first human recipient of CRISPR technology that's like a scene in a science fiction movie right you hear what the first guy they gave it a chance point o is here and it's way more precise see if you could find the article about the guy that was the first human recipient for CRISPR why is it spelled like that like it like a fourteen-year-old emo kid wrote in the basement like there's no e it's just C R is PR I think they wanted it to be catchy and I think it's also what is that an acronym what is an a cramp right yeah I always fuck up acronym and the other one like what's the DEA that's an acronym I thought it was an acronym when you said it well that's nothing when I could become as a word yes I don't think like NIST right NASA like you say NASA you don't say the na sa right so what's the difference though when those I think NASA isn't is that I'm so dumb now that it's just weird knowledge and an abbreviated form of the initial letters of other words and pronounced as a word as a word okay so NASA would be an acronym so I was right super nervous I I'm oh I've always been insecure about those kind of things like that you probably should know like what an acronym is like I don't know any of that shit anymore how do you even remember talking about something I saw or was it - before that I saw him planet Earth - this week in Oz it just came on Netflix it's so good there's this island that only birds can get on to and on this island is a tree that has these seeds that are sticky seeds so they get stuck onto the birds and when the birds travel from Island Island they kind of drop them off or whatever you know but also the seeds can kind of trap the birds there and they can end up now just had right there they can die because they can't that too many of them get stuck my Birds get stuck and then they end up falling onto the ground and then get absorbed into the ground and eaten the plant sort of eat them if you will yo crazy whoa okay but here's the things that coincidence is is just like dumb luck evolution I suppose yeah I think that's yeah it's maybe evolution is like a word that's so under fire with a lot of people maybe that's is because the the ramifications of it that it's that we're not even we're not even gonna be the final thing that's gonna be something like that just how he found out about Darwin's Galapagos a Galapagos Islands where he went the first time imagine going there for the first time NZ and all sorts of crazy you know what's really fucked up people have gone there and they go there with shit in their shoes and seeds from their shoes get into the Galapagos Island and and non-native plants start growing and identify that it comes from literally from people like walking through fields near their house and wherever the fuck they love and then going to the Galapagos and walking around and that Island is so it's been so isolated that it's as like delicate immune system that they have to monitor them and just the crack in your shoe could have a seat in yeah you know there's a lot of those islands I heard the craziest story it's a story about goats that these pirates was it pirates mm-hmm I might have made that part up but these old sailors these sailors used to used to bring goats to islands and they would let the goats off so the goats could populate the island and then they wouldn't have things to eat when they would come back because goats eat everything goats are savage goats and sailors diet during the Golden Age of piracy okay I didn't make it up see I'm so paranoid but it's true so they would show up they would put these goats they would bring boatloads of goats and just leave them on an island and they would say next time we're around this area we got food just go to these stupid fucking goats they eat everything fade everything but that's the thing man they eat fucking everything they devastate ecosystems I had a friend who had goats he had goats he has a really sweet ranch and he had goats he's like oh just have goats they'll trim up the lawn and it'd be great the fuck they do they eat everything everything they just eat man you just leave shit out they eat that and eat everything else too they roses they eat all your vegetables you know this not a tree that's growing they're eating everything they just go through a hillside people use them they have like like services where companies have trained goats and they bring them to your farm or whatever the fuck you wanna just let these goats loose and it's just like it's everything they shit all over the place they eat all over the place and they just keep going they're hilarious though yeah so but they so they had a problem with these goats on one of these pristine islands there was too many of them so what they did is they took one of them and they put a collar on him so they could always locate him they captured him and I think they they snipped him they gave him a little of a second to me so he couldn't make any more goats and then goats always flock to other goats so what they would do is this one guy with the collar they would use him to locate the other goats then they would gun them all down from the sky so they would fly over and they'd like you up there they are we found I thought that thought that gun down all these fucking vegetable eating goats that invaded this island it's a it's a crazy podcast I believe I'm trying remember the name of it was on radio lab which isn't even a sponsor but I bring it up three times a month you just called Galapagos yeah so it is about that very Island is about Galapagos and it's about these goats that they just decided at a certain point I'm with you you have to control the populations of them or they're gonna devastate everything else there's a massive imbalance somebody fucked up they brought goats to a place where there's no predators like goats are supposed to be around like lions and shit you know that supposed to be just by themselves just eating everything and going off could be fine to watch him do it yeah it would be fun did you hear what about that youtuber but he's going through Logan Paul I did read that yeah he filmed someone who had committed suicide in Japan and he put it on YouTube channel yeah there I guess there's this forest at the the bottom of a volcano or something and it's called suicide for hurt it's nicknamed suicide force cuz everyone just goes there to commit suicide you know he was going there supposedly to film how it's haunted and then they find a body and it's pretty gross how he you know how the video he was he kind of joked about it he used humor Jamie told me that the thumbnail had him like posing with the guy you know in the background and and you know he's um I don't know anything about him but I know he's a YouTube guy right and he's doing stuff that he thinks is interesting and provocative you know and for whatever reason the the the dialogue that I'd read was something to the likes of that he had done it to bring oh he apologized for it which seemed obviously felt terrible about the way people viewed it but that he said that how did he describe it he was trying to bring some sort of what he thought he was gonna bring some sort of an awareness to suicide but was like a clunky he just didn't do it right create the respect that it deserved he realized that he fucked up he's basically saying he's trying to do something he fucked up you know I don't know man it's pretty gross I just found out that he's not the same like there's a Jake mmm Paul and a look and Paul I thought they were the same person why blob why is everyone mad I don't know what anyone's mad at him for they mad at him because he showed you something you didn't want to see is that what it is because the video he kind of liked they were like look at his hands too blue and like baked I mean he kind of was very poor taste he also advertised it like the day before the guy I'm this crazy sick video you guys are gonna freak out about you should like that oh so he got a chance to look at and he still approved it and then released it yeah and then he made a thumbnail where it looked like he posed for like photos with the guy in the background it's very you know this was a person and and they're like laughing right next to this body you know it's but I don't know how that disturbs the shit out of us right like making it like joking around you joke around but you can't joke around near a dead guy well suicides not funny since it's not if the guy died like natural causes but no one's laughing the suicide they're laughing at him choking around near the guy who committed suicide like I'm not saying you should do it he definitely shouldn't I don't want to see it but it's kind of funny that we like decide like you see it's respectful bro but he didn't really do anything he just showed up and this guy was dead you know I'm not saying he should make fun of him he definitely shouldn't but it's it's weird the outrage that we have for it I'm sure he made a shitload of money because I've got 7 million views he made money off and suicide yeah you're talking we're talking about we're helping him out well the video got pulled but I guess I got reuploaded a few times you know he just made a second apology today because the first apology a lot of people said was variance yeah I'm not defending him don't don't get me wrong I'm just exploring look sometimes I try to look at things from as many perspective as I can you know I don't I don't I don't think that you ever want to make fun of someone dying right like when you're right there and you're you're taking videos and you're you know it's a dead body hanging that's a terrible idea now 4:20 this was 20 years ago ok probably you know what the most horrific video or a photograph rather I think that I ever saw about the civil rights movement there's this photo of all these weird white people with like if I remember correctly there's kids got it I might have made that up but I remember these people standing there while there was this black guy hanging from a tree it might have been more than one black guy and it's uh it's one of those photos they just make you go oh there's holy shit they're one of the most disturbing photos there this is it right there look look at that photo that's that is the exact photo well actually there's a white guy there too or the white guy that's weird we see a pirate there must have been something went wrong a real photo actually that's the real one son of a bitch that is the real one now I remember kind my memories starting to suck that guy pointing up that looks like Hitler but those look like white cars too bro no ok that's black guy there's a guy on the left that's just like there's something super disturbing about dudes with those old-school press hats on staring up at bodies hanging from ropes fuck man that wasn't that long ago you know that's uh that's what's horrifying but that was less than a hundred years ago and it still happened probably right what year was that but by them but that way 1930 1930 holy shit that that way was like accepted in 1930 all this Sun new stuff like this magic leap these headsets all these different things that we're doing I think they're gonna I think we're in the middle of this so it doesn't it's not registering its how fucking ridiculous it is and how insane it is I think we're just so caught up in the frothy waves of how crazy all this new shit is that we're not we're not really paying attention enough this is this is happening way quicker than I thought it was going to be flying cars right now though no it's gonna be robots those Boston dynamic backflip in gymnastics robots gonna win the Olympics other than proving they can do it is there any benefit and a robot being able to do a backflip dude could you imagine there's no benefit at all could you imagine if the first robot enters into the Olympics and they're people like hey what the fuck you can't do that like and he just we gave him all the strengths of a regular person 100% no more no less and he has feelings too so let him in there and don't be robot phobic goes back to my one question what's gender or the robots or the a female yeah no you know what it is they're they're the first neutral gender people and there's so much happier there's neutral gender nobody cares about gender just be nice that's all they look they care about there's no boy girl they figured out a way to get past that with that CRISPR shit that's what it is have you seen that new sex robot you should get that for the studio all right you see it you can order it now but you don't want the first models matter that way sharper image besides things it breaks your discs they don't break you discs I think would be funny to have the first version now earlier version before they had massage chairs they said this actually might have had massage chairs at the same time but they had this thing that you would grab a hold of it had like handles on the side and it did like shiatsu remember that thing was like like little like little metal knuckles it would dig in your neck it's like this is amazing but I was doing I was like how is this leak there get it someone's gonna get hurt it's like some little old lady and you forced that fucking thing on their neck like yo be careful with this thing thing's got some kick to it the best thing I ever found for that kind of shit is Thai massage you ever go get a Thai massage to stand on you and stretch you out that's the shit yeah that's better than any machine there's something about a person just doing it like getting in there with their elbow is so much better than any machine yeah I have this cool girl I go to and she has like the like the handles where she moves on to and it's just digging her knee in your back and I always say medium and it hurts like hell I can't even imagine the hard one Thais have so many things nailed they they can figured out the best form of kickboxing you know Thai boxing changed everything it's weird that's one small place figured out the way to do it was to kick people's legs and you know how they figured it out man gambling gambling made it profitable to have fights all the time because people loved gamble so they'd have all these people fighting in ties they even altered their style to accommodate the gambling like the first round they would go real slow because they wanted everybody to place their bets so P they would just take it slow and everybody knew the fight didn't really begin to the second or the third round so it wasn't like American fighting where you would have like a Mike Tyson who'd be cherished for knocking people out very quickly like what there would be over/under bets is this guy is Tony Tubbs gonna last the first three run three minutes of the fight you know is Michael Spinks gonna last the first three like world-class fighters dude imagine get hit by Mike Tyson when he was 20 years old not matter how horrible that would be he was at the fights this past weekend I said Idaho hi Mike that's so weird it's amazing he's still a tank too dude terrifying with a person like there's a video of him hitting the bags like 51 years old or something like that hitting the heavy bag like okay he could still fuck you up 100% like in terms of like retired heavyweight champions there was a trend that existed you know where the someone would retire and then they would you know they wouldn't they wouldn't keep their form they would get heavy and that happened with Mike he got like very heavy look at this 49 year old 49 so this is like two years ago fuck all this give me some volume [Music] dude 49 year old Mike Tyson will put you to sleep 100% and when you're around him you realize you like just who's that oh that's Oh make see I blame his trainers right there if I was the guy holding the camera I'd be like stop it okay first of all we got to straighten this whole thing out before you start hitting hard you gonna get a move look at all this this might be just a personal trainer not a boxing person but I'm looking in the background and I feel like I see boxing and stuff on the wall play that play that video young Mike Tyson with custom motto oh my god you want to change the way you feel about physics custom otto was old and dying he was a really old guy but he had just this deep knowledge of psychology and boxing and he trained this unbelievably fast and powerful talented kid who had massive hunger for success that the whole story of Mike Tyson a lot is wrapped up in the story of custom otto who had been around forever and this is his last and greatest pupil and mike knew it Mike knew it what was happening and by the time he won the heavyweight championship tamaño had already died but he dedicated it all to him there was nobody like him you know people like they say oh you know but he never fought Ollie and he never fought these guys that you know his era people weren't as good maybe maybe but everybody in his arey fucked up all of them those Spanx excuse me until last Hendricks know you know well Buster yeah Buster was the first one to beat him but I'm an Holyfield yeah that's how fucked up I am i said hendricks i was trying to remember what the fight was when Holyfield beat tyson those two fights in a row like that was that was big and when tyson bit his ear like that was big like that was like when you realize like he's just not he's not the same guy he was we both lived in Columbus when Buster Douglas knocked him out that was a crazy like he became the big big fucking hero no one knew who he was really I feel oh yeah I was young but then he was supposed to take over the east side of the city he was gonna change everything have a big giant boxing gym it never happened you know the story of Buster Douglas it's an amazing story his mom died his mom died when he was in training for the fight oh really and all of his life he had kind of been really talented as a boxer but hadn't really completely dedicated himself to it so when his mom died he went completely insane in the gym in preparation for Tyson and then when he came out there he it was like two people that had the exact opposite things happen to them for Tyson he had just been smashing everybody for so long he was so good and so scary he would win fights before they even even start it would just be a matter of whether or not you were gonna make it out of the first round sometimes he's just smashing people but for Buster Douglas is like he had some good fights and some bad fights and it just wasn't he wasn't completely consistent but he was talented but then when his mom died it was right when the time when Tyson was you know just overconfident he was a 46 to 1-under daughter I think is that what it was I think was marketed as Tyson his back fight oh wow I didn't know that yeah Tyson is back I don't remember that what um what were the odds because I think it was one of the craziest odds of someone who want to fight for you - Donna - yeah 42 to one is a lot that means you have to be a total sucker to bet on Buster Douglas but I'll take your money stupid yeah yeah I'll give you $4,200 if you give me a hundred you know it's like they're so confident that Tyson's gonna beat them they're willing to bet 42 times whatever you're gonna put up that to me is always I think bets I'm not telling you what to do but I think bets should be like I think actually I take it back I think you should be able to whatever you want but I think the real bet should be who do you want who do you thinks gonna win let's make it real clear who's gonna win if you say well will Michael Spinks make it out of the first round like alright now we're getting weird this is some shit you might be able to affect maybe you might be able to talk to Michael Mike there's a lot of money in this fight this is even more if we can get to the second round I'm saying bro the last bet I hit like that was Amanda Nunez you know Keo in the second round I specifically picked that that's very important to protect against that kind of influence because that shit's real that should happen throughout sports if someone comes up to you and goes look there's a lot of money if this fight goes into the third round it's all we gonna do okay here's the odds 72 to 172 to one this fight goes to the third round know that means you let the fight go to the third round yeah I heard the a lot of people were a little worried about the over-under for the Holly Holm cyborg fight being only one and a half I think was the over-under really thought it probably was gonna go a longer that's a probably a gambling thing right yes it has I think it has to do with though where the money sits but is that what it does I wish we knew I just probably find out exactly I don't we used to talk to gambling experts sometimes on the old days of the UFC on Spike there were a guy would come on and he would he would give us the odds so go local odds maker type guy and he and I would even disagree about shit sometimes goddamnit I can't remember his name see if you can remember that gentleman's name I feel terrible oh is that a boot you had on your head was that oh how dare you it's uh I don't want to mispronounce it it is it like a religious thing or no it's from his his area of dagestan they I have it saved here my thing because people have been asking me in his area of dagestan they wear this thing that says it's what a warrior a mountain clan they're a warrior mountain clan and that this is what their Shepherds wear and this is what you call it mm-hmm I don't want to fuck this up but it looks like it says Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa Papa I'm probably fucking that up but this is how it's pronounced I know how to spell it you look like that one guy that got arrested for murdering his wife what's that Phil Spector oh no that was his wife hilarious show up for court yeah with these crazy wigs on was it a winner with it actually it's here no no they would wig this is um this how you spell it it's PAP a kha bucha yeah that's the same I don't even know if the k if you don't know else okay that's he actually turned to the next level Phil Spector we're looking at Phil Spector from his murder trial was a horrible story like Phil Spector stuck a gun in some chicks mouth Wow and killed her and apparently that was something that he had been known to do he would pull gun sticking in like an artist mouth you know do you know that there's a lot of people think that Jimi Hendrix manager killed him yeah yeah and apparently there's like a guy who wrote a book guy who was a bodyguard or something or another for someone in the music business back then claims that that was he wrote a wrote a book about this and claims that's what happened that Jimi Hendrix girlfriend time jumped off a building she committed suicide and they're like now they threw that girl off a building it's like whoa was hurt wasn't there a documentary or movie about it was there you know you hear about a guy like Hendrix had died at 27 and you go huh what how was that how was he that good huh hells yeah II get it 27 fuck man it would be threatening I saw I saw cuts and roses like a month ago and Earl God is like right in the front row they played a three and a half hour show like it was weird seeing him yeah it was weird seeing him perform I tell you that slash still has it that motherfucker jams three and a half hours is insane yeah what's a normal concert for like Aerosmith or some shit maybe two hours whoa maybe that's a long time three and a half hours if not four hours six hours can I get seven do I get seven well he um he like went to the Darklands and then came back like Axl Rose is a weird guy like he vanished and then returned and now they're killing it it's weird remember when he broke his leg he was singing on stage with a with a cast on on a chair yeah it was weird watching him because when you're that close it's weird seeing things that you normally wouldn't even notice one thing was after every song he was just go behind his curtain come out with a different shirt on and he must have changed t-shirts maybe like 20 times in outfits like you'd have like um I have a scarf on this one and wow that's weird yeah that's him with a leg brace on singing with leather jacket on and a stool pretty badass who the fuck's ever done that before I know Dave Grohl did it while he was performing Axl London has really and it was brace that's the throne thing oh the throne thing and he picked around with him how long did axel have to sing on that thing for a couple months I think wow that's crazy he squats people how it was Dave's and then he loaned attacks oh I'm sorry Oh other way around well that's both badass equally badass either way you do it either way you pop it back and forth what we saying Brian how badass is Dave girl though like he would he was the drummer for Nirvana and then totally chickened created the Foo Fighters right after Nirvana and it's one of the best bands ever you know and he's now not even playing drums anymore was he playing drums for Nirvana yeah he was the drummer for Nirvana and now he's saying well you know I could do anything when drummer the year and guitarist of the year separate he's a bad motherfucker for sure I love the few members no never met him what something's wrong I meant one of the other guys in Nirvana who's the other gentleman Pat smear or you got the guy who flies planes I met him at one of them Marijuana Policy Project interval Aceves Basinger that's yeah hey guys we're gonna guitar up in it fell and hit him in the head during it that's a mistake music oh fuck man that's terrible remember in the old days when people would smash guitars on stage that was like a big deal I used to do it every I mean what the fuck is that about round what was that about what was this whole destroying musical instruments thing about you didn't have any money and you just imagine if you could get Jimi Hendrix guitar did he smash guitars no do you think I got right here at the first person to do it or at least credited with huh let me think 1960s the only him Jimi Hendrix burned his guitar yeah they burned it I'd say the first person wannabe oh yeah I feel like he smashed it - yeah I would say he's smash guitars did me smash it Jamie don't know that he didn't a Laval look up hendricks just for sure but i got to gut it first guy who's guy who's the first guy he Townsend and oh of course that's right that's right Pete Townsend did it you know I might be fucking this up Jimi Hendrix might not have smashed a guitar it might have just been Townsend didn't someone in kiss that Ace Frehley ever smash guitars here's Monterey Pop Festival on fire Jimi's lit on fire and smashed it oh man just hitting everything some weak-ass slams you gotta work on your yeah you can't move those fucking pants those pants man these two constrict your dick so I know these guys had kids lenny kravitz pants ripped open yeah that's right come on of death hang him fly Jimi Hendrix was uh he was wearing those those are jeans like jeans that tight man you can't do shit in those things you definitely can't smash guitars correctly so he smashed guitars a bunch of times yeah yes I think what the feeling of the music you're getting man you just get into it yeah plus you're on acid right yeah also he's on acid a lot during this time wasn't he Wow like this they just let him smash these things here's a guitar sacrifice so a guy like Matt the immortal Brown seeing Jimi Hendrix swing that guitars like just needs a little coaching you still like that's like a big exercise they use with maces and shit you know that's like hitting tires with sledgehammers that's an excellent form of exercise now try to find Nickelback smashing a guitar you're not gonna happen I don't I don't think they're bad [Laughter] but I accept that you don't like it I just feel like as I move into 2018 I want to spend more time positive on things I like then things I don't like and more time if there are things that I don't like I want to be able to look at them in a more relaxed manner and be less less engaged with it and more more just as long as you're not hurting anybody just have fun who gives a shit do you read about Will Ferrel he did a Rose Parade they acted he dressed up in a character with this other girl that used to be on Star Night Live and they they acted like local like news people doing like showing the parade and they broadcasted it live on Amazon Prime and people thought it was real they didn't a lot of people didn't even realize it was Will Ferrell and so like people are like angry about it because they didn't get the joke oh my god it's hilarious he shakes head he's got prosthetic on a show yeah yeah oh my god that is amazing as fictional local TV hosted duo made jokes about the parade's marching bands flower covered floats and inaccurate historical uniforms oh yeah I guess you can get out Amazon Prime right now and I guess there's so many one stars and all the reviews are like how dare they this is a tradition oh my god these local news people that is so funny that's what Will Ferrell's fucking anybody who says Will Ferrell's not funny I can't talk to over a thousand one stars on it yeah I just can't I can't talk to anybody who doesn't think that guy's hilarious yeah see I just contradicted what I said earlier you know how you can like whatever you want I don't care meanwhile I'm like except Will Ferrell yeah fuck for me Talladega Nights man when he's running around in his underwear he's saying Tom Cruise use your witchcraft I'm on fire I'm crying you know that's based off a real thing they have him running out thinking he's on fire because there was a famous car like like what's that petroleum where it's like you can't see petroleum when it's on fire a petroleum fire it's clear or it's invisible okay so this famous racecar driving yeah there was a fire in his car but you couldn't see it so he's like I'm on fire but to everyone else it looked like he was just a crazy person I think this might be it I see like all these people are on fire right now and you can't even tell there's a fire Oh because petroleum fire you can't see whoa what yeah I looked this up today - yeah oh my god so I didn't know that whole CA not know this yeah you can't see petroleum fire till I see at night oh my god that is insane man so all these people are on fire and they're running from invisible fire oh my how am I just now learning this you can't see petroleum fire yeah is that real yeah you only at night there has to be really darkest it's like this the light blue part of it oh my god any orange that is so fucked but how hilarious that was based on her real and so he has flame retardant clothes on so that stuff doesn't catch fire right this is a skin that's getting it oh my god oh my god how horrific and it got into the crowd too like people are like why is everyone freaking out oh there's another radio lab plug oh so since thing about ball lightning see here right now you don't catch it on fire and see how much fire oh my god it's just blue oh so that's your nose see like right there you can't tell us on fire yeah right there yeah that's insane that's insane dude oh my god he just dropped something in it instantly caught fire Wow that's what petroleum fires are dangerous for firemen and you need stuff like yeah but you can't see how do I not know that I can't believe I woke up today on January 2nd 2018 I learned that for the first time should have known that that's a hashtag not woke but your hashtag blessed hashtag blessed but not hashtag woke today I didn't know about petroleum fires it's crazy that you just buy a lighter you know want to talk about like what's the possibility of people being fucked up it's way less than you think because like lighters are everywhere and there's relatively few fires in comparison to the number of lighters you know like everybody's got a fucking lighter everybody we know has a lighter what last time someone window lit some shit on fire right it is weird it's weird it's weird like the real weirdness about driving cars is how few accidents there are that's the real weirdness of course there's gonna be some and more so with these fucking assholes on their phones damn I've been seeing some drifters some people drift in lanes and texting while they're driving holy shit that's common but take that away and it's remarkable how rarely we slam into each other it's remarkable you can go years without a car accident if you're careful years and years and years fuck man express in this city yeah it's something remarkable but you know they happen they definitely happen there's no way right now they can tell exactly what you were doing they just know what happened but if there's a way that they can put one of those set you know how they have don't they have OnStar now and a lot of cars you buy them like from the factory they have that OnStar thing where you you could actually like have calls like make phone calls with whatever it is on the other line like you could say hey can you book me reservation at a restaurant like they're also monitoring like how fast your cars going they're monitoring like certain certain metrics you know certain things they could figure out like what happened when you were causing an accident where'd you go where'd you drive to okay they could track you on GPS and at a certain point time they're gonna be like why can't we just film them we're just gonna film you all the time inside your car and like if you want to drive a Cadillac don't have any fuckin orgies in it cuz cuz we have to film you because otherwise we're never gonna know what the fuck you did because it's car accident well we want to get sued Ultima bill is that Ultima bill has the camera so like if you're doing the lane departure setting yeah it detects if you're not paying attention so then by tracking your face so there's a camera in I think it's Oldsmobiles now Wow well that's sort of like the iPhone X or ten right it sees your face rec you your face to open up your password and it works pretty fucking good it's not perfect but it's like whoo it's a lot better than I thought it was gonna be a lot smoother like I got this phone when I couldn't find my glasses and I found him the other day and I have a beard now and add a stocking hat on still unlocks it does it go through all those things what would change if someone gained or lost weight with anything change I don't think so I think it's the text like how far your eyes are apart you know and like little things like that like I think my what's weird is that I have a Amazon echo in my next to my bed now because it's like the best alarm clock ever it's like it's one of those things where you go like Alexa you know and right but it has a camera on it yeah it's watching for sure yeah the less is watching your your whole life and like keep an eye on me Alexa yeah every time you beat off Alexa there's a check mark right next to you it is weird like will be just sleeping you know the night and it'll exel just like I can't understand what you're talking about your look should just start coming to life yeah she's starting to wake up she's becoming more woke to me oh the best is if we go Alexa rap and does this rap it's do a rap yeah it's and it's a good rap yeah we were talking before the podcast that there was a hitch I could rap we were talking before the podcast is there was something about our Apple buying Netflix one Jesus yeah how do you feel about a company that gets that big I can t feel about like any company that just buys up everything you know they're just Disney Disney bought up Star Wars they but what else they buy up then they just buy the other movie studio owns the Avengers or whatever pair bar pick up paramount I don't know no a lot of money fifty two billion dollars to buy 21st Century Fox yeah whoa so now like the Marvel Universe is complete I think now is it bad is it bad to have giant companies some people would say yes right what about a giant company like Google seems to be a pretty goddamn good company like as far as like the way they treat people supposed to be like pretty good other than that James do more memo thing that that went out remember that that hole where the guy was talking about why there aren't women in tack and what would encourage him and a lot of people said he was Sexton I got crazy I was like then I had to read it like a couple of times you go it's like one or two things it might be misconstrued as being sexist because the term neuroticism and he I think he believes I believe he uses the term neurotic but really SuperDuper controversial fucking thing and although I don't agree with it Google firing the guy I kind of get it I get where they are just to kind of calm everyone's nerves I don't I don't agree with it at all but I understand why they as a corporation would think that way but for the most part I seem to I like what they're doing like they're buying up all these robotics and these these different corporations that are creating the Google didn't Google buy up Boston Dynamics there he sold it though yeah they sold it they bought it and sold it still have a secret interesting I wonder if that's what they des you don't hear about the sale when they get rid of something like that yeah yeah you sell it and then you make sure that you don't sign some sort of a you know non-compete clause must've done it to buy a person there might have been someone working there they wanted to have on their team and so they just will buy your whole company now you work for us whoa that's fucking Game of Thrones type shit with Silicon Disney was smart to buy Hulu because they just pulled all their stuff off Netflix all Disney I think yeah yeah now they're just gonna put it all on Hulu which is awesome because I love Hitler but here's the question like is that is it is it possible to be as big as Google and not be scary right when something gets so big that it controls so much people I tend to just immediately get weary like whoa like this is the whole market right if there's only one way you can get the Internet Verizon was the only internet provider on planet Earth that's it we'd be like hey did just you just you so if that's that because it's too big right controls too much it's like what's the level we're comfortable with you tell people with Apple it depends the company also I think you know like I think a lot of people trust Google you know Apple put the nets over the buildings when the people were jumping did the right thing see the thing with the batteries they did the response that's it do that battery thing is crazy we gotta talk about we talk to how many years ago did we start talking about a Helen called and called it in like whatever the first year of the fucking was when they had a new iPhone then the new new new iPhone well as soon as the new new iPhone came out you were like I know what these motherfuckers are doing yeah but I get their Excuse now is it like - uh it might have been like two iPhones in I want to be honest about this I don't remember I don't remember but I remember there was a time yeah that you called it first way before everybody else I was like Brian's all paranoid about technology hey I understand their excuse oh I get what they're saying I mean they're if the batteries are gonna start failing because it's it can't you know the power is all fucked up in a battery but denied that they know that the throttling down of performance of the phone's not going to influence people into design deciding to buy a new phone is ridiculous yeah you're you're literally disabling the phone yours and you're not doing your customer service base you're not doing them a service because if you were if you really cared about them getting the best stuff all the time what you would do is you would say hey these batteries are gonna get older if you want to continue your phones here's a new battery - reasonable rate otherwise we have to throttle down the performance of your phone so you can get a day's use out of it but that can be avoided by simply swapping out the battery so is what happens when your phone gets to be year old yeah and that that's sort of disingenuous right and the batteries were so expensive now I think they got them down to 29 dollars in response to getting right in this situation reow I think they make amazing shit this iPhone 10x whatever the fuck they want to call it it's amazing it's like it's crazy that there's a company that makes something like that they're gonna make some mistakes I don't know who approved that mistake but that's a mistake they should have done that but the stuff they make is it's someone's got to do that it's not gonna be like the Brian and Joe corporation you know I mean you need something with massive resources and a ton shit fuck ton of people to be able to put together the cash to make an iPhone 10 I mean this you got to hire a lot of fucking people to make this thing right you gotta hire wizards and sorcerers and and goddamn Silicon geniuses and people know how to get lithium-ion batteries thinner than your fucking fingernail and these things nothing in your fingernail right thinner than a finger what's like how thick is a what can't be that thick this shit has a case on it mm-hmm like how thin is a battery in a cell phone it's pretty thin like paper chip or a potato chip rather like a flat potato if you ever could flatten out a potato chip it's a little thicker than that actually what's crazy though is that I the the phone before this iPhone 7 + s whatever the fuck it was when we are when I download the new operating system on it it was crash II it was buggy it fucked up all the time but then when I got the iPhone X the same operating system it worked way better so that's like not anything to do with the battery you know that's just because they've built an operating system around this processor in this screen and all the components on this and then they're emulating it for all the other phones you know or whatever they're doing it's almost like the only way to be truly awesome at something that's just to be greedy - yeah it's like they gotta have like go get a fuel this motherfucker okay okay this is this is projected sales and we can get that up about 20% and is how we're gonna do it do you have the dark secret meetings where they can just add candles went into the fucking basement and they can we're gonna slow down the old phones no don't do it mark watching for technology we've always worked for technology we can't slow down the fucking phones man we're gonna slow them down well I'm down selling the new shit they don't need the new shit it's about information more than it's about new apps you've been watching black mirror I only watched three episodes but I loved it yeah watch the new season I've watched I think one episode in the new season which was the video game episode but the guy was in the lifelike video game that was remarkably similar to Ari Shaffir 's salvia divinorum trip there's no new new season as of like two days ago there's another new I don't have the time for this but the last one I watched was the video game one I'm hooked on the unbreakable kimmy schmitt right now on Netflix have you watched it dude that is a funny silly show oh yeah I have seen that yeah yeah the lady she was trapped in a bunker for 15 years from in a religious cult and she gets out and she's living in New York City and she doesn't know what the fuck's going on it's really funny man there's a couple episodes where kind of falls apart but then it bounces back strong it's very funny again now it's a really good show I'm on like episode I want to say eight I think I'm on Episode eight black marriage getting into some trouble because I guess cart you know that Carl pink Pinkerton yeah yeah supposedly two things I'm into different episodes he talks about something that they stole in Black Mirror and which is weird it was in the news today but um hmm well I don't know what the specifics are so how am i comment but there's a lot of things that black mayor did as subjects that I talked about too but it was just because a lot of people were talking about potential future technologies like this video game thing where they put something in the back your head like the matrix and plug you into some artificial experience that's indistinguishable that's what those I've talked about that a hundred times just from being high you know I'm thinking about what what are they gonna be able to do next that's crazier than Duncan Trussell when he had that HTC vive you put that thing on did you put that thing on I have way oh yeah well yeah but Duncan had me over his podcast and I put it on fuck an hour and a half for I did it we you do just do you do that and you go okay well what's next you know so I don't know if Karl just was able to figure out what's next are they saying this plagiarism yeah I mean if if the do you have the article Jimmy if it seems pretty specific where it's not like hey let's he's talking about simulation theory it's more he actually had this idea I forget what it is I saw it this morning sometimes though it is parallel thinking so let's just in the interest of I don't spoiler alerts in there I don't even want to read okay well watch Carl pink and predict new black mirror plots years ahead of time yeah you're right we can't we can't bring these out so who wrote the article what's it on his moto his moto I love that sorry very good site yeah very good site what here real news it's do you have like five websites that you just shuffle back and forth like like at Gibbs motors one and gadgets one Kotaku's one I do scientists one the scientists um people get mad but you know I like to read the New York Times you'll agree to fake news it's the fucking New York Times okay you cannot just immediately dismiss the fucking New York Times you cannot what any mistakes that anybody has made ever you cannot fucking dismiss the New York Times how dare you they're a giant part of what made people at this level in terms of our understanding of world events a giant part leading to 2017 look if you look at the history of human beings understanding the reality of a detailed intellectual understanding of the reality of certain current world events compiled in a daily resource the New York Times changed the world it offered people super high-level information from uber smart people on a regular basis and to dismiss that and say that that's just as good as any other paper said no no this is a pursuit would they were and they were in a pursuit for excellence in information now whether or not they made some mistakes to I criticize them for that Conor McGregor the weird thing that they said is his face was covered in blood and he was and they fixed it immediately yeah they said he almost fell through the ropes before the rescue the referee rescued him he got his ass kicked you have to make anything up like that what happened was amazing you don't have to like embellish it just to make your magazine this is crazy like you can't do that you're the New York Times like an especially in this day and age you gotta resist and you gotta be armed robber you're glue you can t respond you can't and you can't put out anything fake you just can't you know but people they go oh the New York Times is fake news like they've been around for so long do you know much important shit they put out you're gonna just dismiss them cuz you love Trump is it you're really willing to do that that's that's as crazy as anything I've ever heard you can't do that either like they can't be exonerated I mean they can be exonerated but they can't be exempt from not being called out by printing something that's not true they everyone should be held up to the same standards but if you don't appreciate what the the New York Times has done that seems crazy to me it's just they're really important did you see all that Trump like global warming tweets like he doesn't really understand global were nice trolling the scientists wake up yeah freezing right now global warming snow true he's 17 he's he's trolling yeah that's true I wish the whole thing with the trough that'd be so fucking no he's talking about that though you know he just doesn't want anybody fucking with them and he feels like a lot of the mainstream media they fuck with him and so he fires back and then it becomes this weird thing where all the people that are on his side started like they you know they pick people pick sides man and like fake news food news like no it's the New York Times it's one of the best news sources ever have they said shit that's not true a hundred percent you know why they're run by people people fuck up everywhere there's not a place where they go where they don't fuck up every fuckin place a person goes they fuck up they fuck up in Harvard they fuck up an MIT they just fuck up way less than most of us there's still just people it's weird time right now it's a weird time right now as far as of the way people are looking at things you know just seems exact everything seems it's very exaggerated a group preparing for something like we're a screaming baby war I think so yeah North Korea well here's the other thing North Korea just made a speech recently where they were actually open to high-level talks and they were there more it was way more passive and less threatening yeah and people like this crazy motherfucker might realize Trump is a crazy motherfucker too who actually runs the u.s. and unlike Obama who would probably never consider attacking North Korea he's looking at Trump he's like this dude is 70 okay he's old as fuck he's been a gangster his whole life and now he just took over the country and he left the military guys do whatever the fuck they want to do you don't think there's a high possibility that some of those spaceships from Nevada might come out of a hole in the ground and go rocketing towards North Korea in 20 minutes and let loose some crazy new bombs that you haven't even heard of yet it's entirely possible he knows it I don't like to think there's any benefit to our current situation well we also just cut off while there with a gas yeah yeah there's some serious sanctions so that might be wise that's actually probably more logical yeah but I'm doing more the comic book thing it's like people don't want to piss Trump off it's interesting you know yeah I make sense he's like he's definitely nuttier than the regular dude was definitely not nuttier than the regular dude this in the job I thought we were getting attacked the other day when that SpaceX launch happened like it I was well everyone at Starbucks at Starbucks everyone it started running out and I was like oh my god what's going on like is there a bomb like I was kind of freaked out then everyone's like staring at sky so I run out and first I thought it was an alien because that pulsating smoke that was happening on the side like I did never seen anything like that before it was like wait my eyes I've never seen that before because it was like it looked like a big whale then there was like a dot in the middle of it that was pulsating like smoke rings almost whoa and it just looked foreign it looked like an alien but then everyone's like is that Korea and I'm like I didn't even think about North Korea back is that head to downtown I saw one of those once on Melrose it was a launch out of Edwards Air Force Base they launched something like some missile tests he's like whoa you saw this thing shooting across the sky people are pulling their cars over this is a long time ago and they did it like right at dusk right as the Sun was setting and they shot I think they thought they could get away with it they could sneak it in there before we could see it it's it's weird that they do that like there was a lot of car accidents when that happened because everyone thought what the fuck were we getting attacked it's weird that they don't like you know how your phone goes off if Pablo gets kidnapped by his stepdad right now you have that but they want to say hey there's gonna be a big rocket launch don't you show up Jamie what is this time-lapse are the one from last week that is crazy oh my god oh my god that is crazy and it's it's going around the earth and off into the fuck it's shooting off 3:00 on Friday night so just here's your warning night don't freak right when is the one where he shoots a Tesla to Mars what is he doing that that's coming up soon damn I think that's what the thing on Friday is supposed got pushed from Friday to Friday from Thursday and it's setting up the next the big launch which i think is that worries has there ever been a guy that's more like Tony Stark didn't Elon Musk never exhaust do you think he's sending his car away so he can go get it like he's gonna be the first one to come fucking out of here don't take my car with me I won't let him go you gotta stay do we need you down here you might not make it back what if your calculations are off what if your calculations are off like you know sometimes people were saying they get up the Tesla and the door handle doesn't open up automatically and then you don't even have a door handle like okay what if that happens when you're up there bro yeah never never had a supergenius that everybody wants to just hand the keys to before what if he is the Bitcoin guy to that some people think some people think he created Bitcoin yeah shit I have to ask mr. antonapoulos if he agrees with that I don't believe that that's why don't you because that would be too crazy it could have been too crazy what if he's an alien what if he's the future he's dating Johnny Depp sax he can't be took was broke up with her bro he brought it to the comedy store one night oh that's right dude I got to think that there's levels to everything and there might be even levels in the super genius category and he's in some weird new crazy ultra productive level of the super genius category did he he powered what part of New Zealand was it or something like that that gigant was it Australia was Australia he made some sort of a bet where he would install some mega battery complex in Australia I remember in this way and it worked perfectly in record time - Tesla built a giant battery to fight power outages in Australia and it's already working and it worked in like milliseconds like the power went down and it kicked on in milliseconds only last three years before it starts to 0.14 seconds that's the same after a major plant the law yang sank station in the neighboring state of Victoria suffered a sudden drop in output that's amazing it kicked in just 0.14 seconds after the thing went out the thing nothing yeah man he's a wizard he's some sort of new type of cultural figure like the the electronic daddy he's the guys making cars he's gonna build autonomous what are those transporter trucks gigantic semi trucks the boring company yeah the boring company he's gonna fix traffic why is it just keeps going why isn't he tackle things like cancer herpes figured out in your own bitch I'm busy making electric cars the fuck what do you why don't you fix it I'm doing this I made a car I made a car I'm shooting one of my cars to Mars welcome wanna watch you think he's got like he's gotta have two or three friends that are also like what do you guys want to do this month what are we gonna fix or fuck with or he's too smart to have friends he's got a couple people that he observes got to have a buddy he bounces some shit off as an alien his you don't think the buddy would go just talk to Johnny Depp if you had a real buddy I feel like listen she seems amazing she's probably telling the truth I don't know I don't know who's right who's wrong I just I want you to be happy bro I don't want craziness you like she just got off doing coke and jumping out of windows and Harris freaking out yeah I think there's levels to the super genius game and he's some new level he's like some new Mike Tyson punch-out character like whoa like this is the new super genius inventor level but that's also a super famous person like everybody knows who Elan musk is it's almost like a character like if you wanted proof that there's some sort of a really super complex but captivating narrative about being a person 2018 he's a central character was he smart his whole life like was he's creating things in like middle school and high score did you one day out of nowhere this guy comes about oh if it didn't solve stuff I'm smart that's a good question maybe it's all off Rouge it's a good question it's really just box con what if he's the first robot when if they sent him till like we we get him to run for president he wins and then on TV cuts open his arm and he shows you the circuitry it's like robots need love too I helped you guys I fixed your whole fucking world that's the way you made a computer game when he was 12 doom doom VR have you played that yeah it's very disturbing to know those people that are that much smarter than you right yeah well here's the thing like people are better than you at shit you got to get over that there's just no way around it you know imagine if you like Elon Musk's older brother and you you know you know like bro you know shit you're only seven it's like okay I need it just bruised up inside of him grows grows in power then what do you do even if you're happy even you have a great life like even if you're like you know what do I do oh I make log furniture you know like for outside for the patio I mean some of people's fondest moments you're sitting out in the back patio and I just it seems kind of old-fashioned to me and one of the old-fashioned things that I like is log furniture so I build log outside patio furniture my name is Michael Michael musk yeah I'm just super happy couldn't be happier yeah yeah he's my brother huh huh huh yeah Uline he's uh we tell you something eons on speed okay he lands on adderall and provigil and new vigil and he's taking micro doses he micro doses he's not clean test him he's got a brother Kimble Musk the real Elon Musk he's a super genius that exists in the lotus position and floats in midair and some wheat silo somewhere in New Hampshire and they go visit him a couple of times a month I wouldn't mind I would be like give me a free Tesla every a couple days they probably got that dude in the bunker with Dick Cheney right now Kimball Musk what if yeah I want to know what Kimball does he teaches kung fu he's in those videos that I always post on Instagram he's just imagine if his brother was just uh not oh look at them handsome bastard drinking coffee at my age 45 regional manager for a blockbuster video always from South Africa even crazier so a lunch from South Wow because started a company called zip2 and sold it to compact and that's reason South Africa is a interesting place very very interesting place a lot of people I know that go there love it and obviously the crazy history with Nelson Mandela on apartheid and how recent that was to us but I always think of that sugar man movie when I think of South Africa now I always think of district 9 doesn't it look like district 9 there um the movie with the robots yeah weirdo the no no district 9 was the the movie with the aliens there were aliens well they no they were robots right there were like weird aliens what were they I think sort of thing of both honestly it was like some sort of tech alien oh that's right never it can't show it again that was a great fucking movie I love that movie that's one of my favorites oh that's right yeah they were like some sort of Mac gun is yeah that's right man fuck that was a good movie to watch it I think it was shot in South Africa I think that's where he's from - got it made at Neill Blomkamp yeah um what was the movie I said that it made me remind me of what I just god damn it D Antwoord is always a big connection I always think about them mm-hmm but I was saying it was Nelson Mandela and there was something else that made me think about South Africa I'll come back to it oh that illicium movie that was the Matt Damon movie was that in South Africa I think it's sort of similar topic as district 9 it's crazy that a guy like Elon Musk's some super duper fucking genius would come out of that spot what's that plays like do a JRE in South Africa hey to a live JRE swim with great whites fuck that that's true right that's a scary spot like I'm here when you fly over them in your plane they jump up and try to bite the plane think of that spot man you want to talk about spots South Africa like Dutch colonists trying to like carve out a place in the in the land in Africa what do you got me here the wild boys in South Africa Oh got the zebra suit and went out and let lions fuck with them great daddies we had steve-o on the kill Tony last night for the weigh-ins is this in a game preserve though as I remember them hey actually telling a story on here I think that shot the lion part here in LA the reason why I ask is there's place they have place in South Africa where they let the Lions loose or not like they know when to let them loose like it's kind of uh oh Jesus Christ the Lions actually tried to get him oh no oh my god that's insane the Lions took away their hat this is zebra head dude that is so crazy they're lucky they lived they did the dumbest stuff on that show yeah that really was he's had more than one experiences with lions then because I thought the one that he had in the tree was the only one he ever had is that steve-o right there that Britton he's crazy I had drinks with him Everlast Eddie Bravo one of Eddie students and steve-o's girlfriend we're all hanging around and steve-o was telling me like all these different things that he's about to do I was like why like why are you doing that he's showing me the scars that he had on his arm from the operations where he had to what's going on here he put his lip and then jumped out in the water with sharks Oh God no cage just jumped in the water with a hook in his mouth his latest one where he got burnt his back and everything yeah that's what I'm talking about he he had a bunch of different skin grafts from cadavers that's so crazy that he looks good now there saw him last night he does he's showing but he's planning on more chaos he's not like you always gonna go you're done you're fine he'd walk everything's fine let's just end this nope it's like Evel Knievel that guy never stopped right I think he's way less busted up than Evel Knievel Evel Knievel lived in the days where you know they the medicine was not as good but he also was flying motorcycles and shit we different weight Evel Knievel was jumping Rockets across canyons remember that Snake River Canyon is that what it was where was that an Arizona or some shit what do you remember that he had a rock head he shot it across a canyon those uh those guys that climb those skyscrapers and stuff did you see that the guy that fell yeah that was a creepy video to watch horrifying video to watch scary horrifying yeah that that's um encouraging that is not wise but discouraging it I've seen a lot of those videos right I've watched a lot of them I had what is his name we have in the show super strong fingers King James Kingston King James Kingston was a very nice guy who has done a lot of things online that have freaked me the fuck out he was really nice guy I don't want to tell that guy can't do something that I enjoyed watching that he succeeded in doing I don't I don't want him to land on me either you know it's like I mean how much time and effort have you done into cleaning up the bottom area where you might fall because you're gonna fall if you fall okay I'm not saying you're gonna fall but if you fall you might fall on somebody okay this is different fuck this this is not walk on the top we got away with it we got away with it just thinking you know in the interest of full disclosure we got way too high before the show who legal weed that's why you know what it is also that that fucking the weed that we used to have before sober October and the weed after sober October is different different stuff and I think the combination of those two things the combination taking a month off and then trying some new different stuff there's different stuff it's different yeah but your tolerance also restarted yeah it's not good right now sketchy you gotta be careful I gotta gingerly gingerly walk into the waters one month éclairs you oh yeah it cleanses you it's amazing how fast it cleanses like three days if I haven't smoked in three days and I swear the joint I'm like so stoned like out of my gourd you know I still can't remember what I wanted to say about South Africa I knew it had something to do with apartheid and the struggle in that area and how strange it is Africa in itself oh what's that what's that chappie chappie oh there was another movie as a DI word one yeah yeah that's right that's right that wasn't as good Diann word came out strong there interesting that you Lani Howdy's there Yolanda Yolanda Yolanda Yolanda Foster how do you say her name how do you say it I think it's you Lani Yolanda Yolanda Neyland Yolandi Visser that's it Yolandi Visser she had like bingo yeah what movie was that chappie mm-hmm do you know that they they were like you know they're like the main characters of the movie but they said something or they did about the director or the the studio they did they got in a fight so they took them off the poster and everything that's why they're not on any of the posters even though they're like main characters oh that's unfortunate yeah that sucks see that's why people like Deanne weird a little too raw they need like a slick-talking manager listen we're doing we're dealing with artists here ultimately they don't really mean what they say it's just the same explosive nature that lives inside then it lets them create such amazing music that you're a fan of and I'm a fan of sometimes it gets haywire and you would just like to come in apologize for bitch slapping you know telling you to suck his dick it's just what's all wrong yeah I mean they didn't even marketed that Dee Antwoord was in it that's crazy that seems like a mistake it seems like you don't like money but who knows who knows what they're really like you know that would be the big bummer right you meet him in there dicks yeah me and Duncan hung out with them really he smelled like armpits people's armpits smell lovely it's like that one year you took deodorant it wasn't a whole year it's like a week to seem like you're just making waves and smell ya can't do that you just can't not wear deodorant I tried for a little while it's weird is it interesting to that we've all just accepted that we have to put chemicals on certain parts of our body in order not to smell after you've been moving around for too long that's weird man like have you ever shaved your armpits wanted by mistake bad idea I wonder how much of an effect it must have some effect on what your armpits smell like has to yeah yeah for sure but you can't do it unless you're a bodybuilder like these things you could do like if my chest itches I'll shave my chest and I'm embarrassed to say it but I'll do it especially it gets itchy after a while I don't fuck with my armpits bro that's vain guys shave their arms that don't have like carrot top or someone say yes well carrot top used to be a super bodybuilder jacked guy remember him I think he said he'd just he did it one time when he was a swimmer and he just liked the feeling sliding oil up oil up before swim so he's not buff anymore he's back to normal he's still buff he's just not a giant bodybuilder guy creepy buff he I don't want to talk for him because I don't know him but I know Duncan did something with him a long time ago they did a pilot for some sort of a reality show do this reality show carrot top um yeah that's the carrot top it is jaggedy jagged and that's like a normal carrot oh yeah that's I think it's more he's like now he's like more like Luke's fit yeah but like back then he looked like super duper jacked like his shoulders were popping out unnaturally wide like it didn't even make sense like right there yeah like he went off the deep end it looked like he'd mean he's so big who knows what the fuck he was doing but he was doing all that shorter is not look it looks like implants yeah it could be something called synthol that some bodybuilders engage in and what it does they think it helps them balance out areas of their body that aren't big enough and it's real weird because there's a ton of videos of people taking you know the videos putting synthol on their muscles and dancing around that's not no that's just him looking buff that doesn't look anything nearly as bad we're looking at carrot top where you can see his dick exactly when I um describe that look to people where a man has his underwear at the very base of his cock that's your dick root that's a beautiful term yeah thank I by the way I demand 100% credit for dick root ticker I created exhaust I was trying to figure out how to describe what was uncomfortable about those kind of pictures it's like you're trying so hard and like that's dick root that's dick route all the way carrot tops it looks like it's a thong on it doesn't even look like it should be possible with the laws of gravity it looks like that thing should fall down your ankles and her freckled boner should come rocketing at the screen like a 3d shark in Jaws 3-d but he's he's just jacked I mean he's just a guy who wants everybody suck his dick was like let you know it's right there right there that makes sense but I mean but he's just jacked that makes sense but what doesn't make sense is this the people would stick the oil in their arms and they create like water balloons where their muscles should be and they would dance around and there's one video of a guy like throwing punches in the air with these water balloons for arms it's it's so weird it's just it's so strange a dick root remember that does a bunch of people that have those pictures those dick root pictures yeah I see Dane Cook put like loves the dick route he is photos works harder than Jim yeah I'm to show the goods Oh notes yeah this guy this guy 100% is using that stuff for he's got two equally sized tumors does he think that looks good well he's probably mentally deficient right he's probably something severely wrong with oh my god yeah now if he was like balancing on top of a skyscraper at the same time would be even worse see the thing about this young man is you know it's probably something severely wrong with him but what he is as an abuser look at him you thrown punches like he's like some sort of a boxer character with his giant water balloon arms but he's an abuser of something how many people are a more reasonable user of it and use it and that's what somebody thought that the carrot top stuff was that's it's real common yeah he's a powerful arm-wrestled guy was one on its way more jacked in the other yeah that can't be good for you bro that's real yep yep he smashes people in armwrestling it's so crazy this is dick rate like come on man what is that don't do that dude he's probably gonna be hurting when he gets older we got yes Brian might know I think he's like this topic have you heard of the Korean Hulk guy that's supposedly dating Lindsay Lohan Yeah right now and all of a sudden this shows TMZ Jamie jumps in relationship gossip you son of a bitch that's what you do every time well they posted a photo last night James and you know she's dealing with the IRS right how that guy's super jacked holy shit look at his dog it's good he's living with a werewolf that's like a monkey werewolf I tell you man I love Koreans we had a family dinner for my girlfriend the other day and I come in and they're cupping they're doing that thing where they they like a little mole and then they they put these glasses and they pretty much suck the bad blood out of you so I walk in and there's just blood everywhere in towels and and and shit like that what is it supposed to do it's supposed to we've talked about this before right it's supposed to some accelerate blood flow to the area like pulls the tissue the skin away from and accelerates blood flow sometimes the blood comes out as gel which is weird it's supposed to but there's what I didn't know is a lot because I posted a video of it while they were doing it a lot of people are saying that cupping is bad for you and then I did research there's if it goes bad it goes bad it leaves permanent damage if they if they don't do it right and really yeah if there's some photos that are pretty disturbing where like pretty much just holes in people's backs oh fuck yeah but yet then they had the Olympians do it you know like people that people for the Olympics do it so it's like what's you know well I don't know shit about medicine but I would imagine oh my god what is that coming down Batman ease man left with horrific holes in back after botched whoa that's awful for somebody that could be just somebody who did it completely wrong well what's that one that far right where it looks like it is horns lower right lower right the bottom but people go and scroll down scroll down scroll down that one to the right in the middle with the orange and the blue the right all the way to the right Jamie the other right edge of the screen go to the edge of the screen that guy BAM yeah horns this is water buffalo they're just using buffalo horns as cups Oh Oh Wyatt copying with buffalo horns that's what Rogan does so yo bro I do that amazing my balls my big root what made sense to me is that you would kind of like create damage which is while that blood exists and that maybe that it'd be like almost like a PRP sort of a thing where all that extra blood that you've created from that area would go and help the blood flow to the part that's injured and you accelerate healing you never know man because you can't the people that are in the Olympics don't ever do anything stupid because they definitely would do something stupid someone can talk to me to doing a bunch of shit if he if sometimes like the psychological edge and believing that there's something that's gonna work really good will be just enough to get a few people to do it but this has been around for a while this has been around long enough where people are going like you know there's like really significant benefits yeah water buffalo things real yeah they really do it that way yeah it's almost like traditional for I guess Korean culture because I mean they were just doing it like it was nothing I had a family dinner that's crazy that's crazy but maybe that works you know I mean the only way you find out if stuff like this works which is like a really unconventional therapy is you gotta try it if all those super genius type guys that are training these Olympic athletes and getting them to peak performance and what could potentially be worth millions and millions of dollars in sponsorship money if they win the gold medal if they're having these people get all cupped up it's probably something to it right in this day and age I think it's like acupuncture I feel like I don't know enough to know if that's accurate or not it seems like it is some people believe in it a lot because they pay a lot of money for it do it all the time yeah for sure a lot of people do believe in acupuncture but cupping seems to me to be like more next-level it's like you're pulling the skin away from the area to the point where it bleeds and turns into the big ass bruise a this giant circle red spot where the increased blood flow hasn't been filtered out of the body yeah like you got some weird shit happen there that a normal thing you got a big circle bruise on your back right where you're hurt oh I see what you're doing you're making it all bleed in there so it flows everything out of there and heals it up quicker it kind of makes sense to a dummy like me like I don't know anything about how the actual body functions in terms of like how things heal and whether or not it would accelerate or not but that Michael Phelps guys doing it yeah when I asked him how you know how's it feel afterwards he says I refreshing I feel way energetic now and relaxed well it's like people that wanted to deny the benefits of cryotherapy before like some papers came out there's a lot of people poo-pooing and partly for good reason it's because a lot of the people that we're running these cryotherapy sites got overzealous in their claims they got real overzealous in their claims of like how much weight you can lose how much better you can look all these different things that may or may not be true when it comes to throat cryotherapy especially in the way they described it but what can't be denied is the way it makes you feel it makes you feel fucking amazing you do three minutes while those crappy proud their appeal aces you come out they like woo everybody I know that's try that it's been like woo like I give a lot for that woo like that was good but everybody's right to be suspicious because the part before the will was annoying there was a lot of like you know I can't crease collagen in your skin it's like a virtual facelift and like there's a lot of people that claiming something like though where's this you gotta you gotta be able to prove that but they can prove anti inflammatory markers in the blood they can prove all these like hormones and these neuro chemicals that your brain can can make when you're you're in that tank when the cryotherapy chamber rather you don't yet now I want to do it today no you get you do it today I'll definitely do it I just today I don't I don't feel great maybe make you feel better I hate a head of milkshake two minutes in there woke up at 6:00 morning this whole podcast has been a ruse to get me to get you into the cryotherapy chamber I want to do a couple of sesh you too big someone's gonna burn you'll touch the walls test the laws so that people do go in as couples but you got to be like right close to each other yeah people like to endure shit together I heard you have a tank here now though yes we do that's cool did I crash yeah crash mating float lab shout-out to the float lab float lab Venice Westwood yeah crash put it in there he's a wizard he knows how to do it it's all crazy filter with ozone and yeah UV light filters and one micron field he was explaining it all to me but it's like it sounds good it sounds like you did good shit oh I'm too fucking dumb plus I can't pay attention to everything that's problem man that's how I feel when people keep bringing up Bitcoin I was like you know let me know when you get this sorted out because I watched a lot of a lot of things I can't follow the Bitcoin show I can't I just I can't so when we got those bitcoins man when I when he gave us bitcoins a long time ago who gave us yes right and I've been trying to open up my wallet ever find my password to that wallet it's gone like I'll never be able to get that Bitcoin he gave him even though it was at the universe have it let it be a statistical anomaly it's probably worth billions of dollars millions billions for now it's like you get in and get out and people are accusing people of pumping dumps and there's subterfuge subterfuges taken into consideration of some of the highs and lows anyway of course just like everything right like big corporations taking over shit it's like these these patterns are north their normal you see them coming if you're gonna have something like Bitcoin you can have people for sure not everyone's gonna be able hey man I'm a fuckin thief but not with Bitcoin Bitcoin would be super cool no more deception this is about the future revolution it's about resolution this is about the children no anybody's a scam artists it's gonna be a scam artist and anything they can whether it's a fake religion or a fake dating site or fucking whatever whatever they could do whatever they can get you with they're gonna get you with like oh this is what you guys do now okay I'll pretend to be that hop right in there right what do you think is the next big breakthrough that's gonna change in terms of like how technology and people get along he's gonna be a robot sex doll now I think home home assistance you know like having a robot could be your home base like computer I don't know like these Alexa's and I like apples about the release Thurs and Google has a release thirds and I've seen the autonomous robots that monitor parking lots no yeah I tweeted it I think yesterday but definitely robots we're gonna give up our security and all our privacy at the same time we're gonna be fine because the robots gonna be watching us keep an eye on you robot there's gonna be zero privacy zero it's real close it's already there but I mean real close they're not just regular zero privacy but like no one ever has a moment alone ever it doesn't exist anymore like it'll slowly erode then you go into the mountains and to put cell phone towers out there and then it's gonna be it whatever the technology is it's gonna be you're gonna know where everyone is at any moment and we're gonna really get to know each other what do you got Jamie I was looking up for the thing I saw I saw it it wasn't on your Twitter feed I guess I saw a video of like autonomous parking robots yeah or is it another spot so I didn't put it on Twitter I call it a dead shit it was a cup a pretty sure i retweeted it you know what it does though i think i retweeted somebody else saying hey this is happening or something like that so is probably not that clear one of the more recent tweets it's happening Brian they're gonna be flying around us monitoring us you saw that one robot I think it was in San Francisco homeless people or somebody that can move when stuff like that happens it's gonna be a big pullback it's crazy robots but yes we we need robots picking on the downtrodden that's good move let them know you pussies are on your way out the robots are here I mean that literally is like the first wave of immigrants from the silicon world robots that fuck with homeless people the first the first invaders tripping and stuff I Robot the thing about iRobot is you'd watch it and it was it was made just at the right time it was made where you didn't think it's ever possible it's made at a time wow this is pretty cool like yeah man the future yeah I could see it being real but you didn't think it was really possible and now you watch iRobot and you go oh it's inevitable that's inevitable that thing that does the robot thing would what pretends to be a person and and looks real freaky that's easily doom akima or was that machinima was that one there it is that's it security robots are using - are being used to ward off San Francisco's homeless population that's the drone what's it called who makes that thing does it say they retired it yeah oh they did because there's a there's a whole company that makes those things and has them like wandering around parking lots and I mean I hope i retweeted it I try to somebody said it to me and I was like okay that's how it happens they just have these things wandering around recording everything so everybody's responsible for any car accident anything that ever happens if it hears someone screaming rape if it hears someone screaming police it immediately goes to the scene of films there's no worries about its own mortality it's streaming in real time it gets to record all altercations between people eventually hotels agree as long as this is password secure and encrypted they allowed to have the fire detector in the corner double as a video camera that records everything in the room at all times what's gonna happen yeah I agree just gotta get used to people watching fuck already I took the sticker off my webcam on my laptop a long time ago job they could watch me all along I don't know why I'm more nervous about this in 2018 this is what's silly I mean it's become accelerated like I'm more nervous every year when it comes to technology because I'm not nervous in the way that I think it's totally 100% negative but nervous in the way like it just seems to me that we might be in the middle of something and not be paying attention like that it's happening so fucking fast that were caught up in it and it's just this wild wave of change and I'm just trying to make sense of it while it's happening but then there's something about like numbers like I used to think that saying like the year 2017 mm but who cares what your it is it's all just now but no there's like a way we feel about it differently like you it's a fucking 2018 dude dude it's like you have a feeling about you now it's like we're we're very very far ahead in this game this is this is the future 2018 that's a crazy number hey man's 19 so it's 2018 whoa so weird and when does this thing like if you had a guess how much longer does a human race have six months if you really I guess we're not gonna be here forever right so we're not gonna be here a hundred thousand years from now or two hundred thousand years from now we're just not I started listening to the audiobook of sapiens yeah and that's I feel like that's what it's getting to just that question you're asking the first couple chapters are leading up to like he says it over and over again like thousands of years from now maybe 2000's what it's saying that the human race won't be or human beings won't be what we are today will be another evolution of whatever that is because off of Australia pickett yeah let's try Eutychus Australia Pittacus see if you find any good pictures of that thing I mean this is what they think they think that that that's what started it that was when it was like fairly distinctly human it's gonna it's gonna keep going it's gonna go to some new thing there it is look at that thing I mean that's so close it's what like a walking upright chimpanzee and then that got smarter and that got smarter and things kept going but the thing that really fucks you up is it's not that long ago like I think Australia Pittacus was less than 2 million years right and then there's modern homo sapiens which I think they think are somewhere in the neighborhood of three hundred five hundred thousand years old they keep moving it around a little bit when they find some new dead guy I find some new bones and like ah this one's older they got a conic guessing I want to say they're in the neighborhood at 300,000 that ain't shit dude that ain't shit that just happened if that's when they really started that just happened so you're talking about 300,000 years from now whoo we're gonna be made out of gas we're gonna be like those fires that are in petroleum you won't be able to see us our intelligence to be all pervasive well we'll have a one operating system that we share with Mother Earth they'll plug it into our brains will plug into the ground will become divine how about that no no one's that's how I am I always wonder what they thought about this 200 years ago 150 years ago what they thought are we I feel like they thought that the world was gonna end - back then yeah they're appalled everybody's always telling theirs away from an ending sure man anytime anything especially back when there was no media anytime anything catastrophic happened in your area you thought that was gonna be the end the moon was made of cheese it's it's really weird how recent that was that's what's weird when you just think about hundreds of thousands years it seems like a long-ass time but it's not when you talk about the shape of human beings and what what's happened in that amount of time especially in the last few hundred or a few thousand years just all you need is sick if you want to like really impress the shit out of people give me ten thousand years ten thousand years ago and ten thousand years now you're like wow you'd freak out there's no other time in history that would be the case like every other time in history ten thousand years would be like whoa oh they figured out how to make cooler houses like whoa oh he's riding an elephant how do you figure that out like whoa all the bow and arrow is way better than my bow and arrow every 10,000 years ago big deal then all said one 10,000 year period and you have everything you got the pyramids you got space travel you've got the Internet you got video photography 3d printers every time you say something like this this Pop's in my head the end of gangs in New York which shows that montage of the hundred years or so of New York changing nice think about that's only a hundred years in New York change from this crazy nothingness even though it's really big then to like tons of skyscrapers and bridges and all of what it is today and it wasn't any anything close to that back then and that's like 100 years and you're talking about 10,000 well that's so much more time compared to 100 yeah that's an amazing montage time-lapse which call that that's time-lapse look at that that's incredible New York City's a freakout man and even more crazy look at that keeps going yeah that's even bigger now oh my god and towers right there yeah New York City is a genuine freakout unless you've been you should go if you been you get it you're like yeah it's not to love going but if you haven't been it's a paradigm shift ER because you realize that it's possible it's such a big city I've been a lot of big cities but New York City is so crazy and it's the way it's constructed that you go there you have like a different feel about you you like whoa okay we're in New York City this is this is different it is different these buildings are fucking giant these people are everywhere this is crazy this is there's a different completely different feeling and different people yeah unfortunately the people are straddled down by the echoes of the immigrants that were their great-grandparents and their grandparents and their struggle that they had to get from Europe over to America this is my fuck because this is my own family I'm talking about I feel like a lot of the Italian immigrants with my grandfather he came over when he was boy and his family and on both my mom's and my dad side they all came over from Europe either from Ireland or from Italy and they were all like really aggressive risk-taking people you know and those are the people that built that whole area which is just we think about like what a crazy accomplishment it is to build this gigantic city from all these immigrants that came over from Europe you know from 1700 whatever it is just constructing all these incredible buildings like it's a very very bizarre accomplishment but that same kind of energy you know that brought those people over there in the first place would create like a lot of interpersonal conflict a lot of aggression I don't know if New York's totally gotten past that I think they have more now than ever before like they I was reading something about the crime rate that New York's crime rate is the lowest it's been in a long-ass time I think we're at the highest right now right LA is taking us up I feel like I just saw something the other day where we've had more homicides this year than recent fall asleep seems like it remember I saw something I was closed up but I thought the murder rate was down but violent crime was apparently more pimps laps than ever yeah three police chase this is a day on the TV it's like ridiculous how that's awesome yeah police chases are fucking terrifying cuz you don't want the cops just let someone run away or you don't want the cops to slam into you while they're chasing some guy you know yeah crime rates in New York City reached record lows and some article bottom de Blasio that's the guy right it's just if you don't know that that's possible going there and seeing that it's possible and then realize that its own within a hundred years that's where it's mind-boggling or 200 years or whatever New York Sanders has been around for in totality what is the world we're experiencing right now gonna be like in a hundred years I mean are its it almost seems to me like there's no way we're gonna be able to guess if you look at how quick that accelerated and use that as a pattern like that kind of happened all across the country with Chicago LA San Francisco they all were nothing and then everything you know some people say New York won't be here in a hundred years because of the water rising up right well that would be crazy fuck well we have a water crisis in a lot of parts of the country just kind of suck the water out of the ocean and use it to spray all these dry ass bushes who stopped the fires yeah almost thinking I'm always thinking suck the water out of the ocean stop look stop making new houses for a while start constant and sucking the water out of the ocean to put out the fire just water all those trees get suck out the water out of the air like you can just get a bunch of humidifiers and then spray to the water that's not good because then people dry out and then Botox goes up this is what I think they gotta figure out how to get the salt out of the water right they know how to do it but you can't just take ocean water and mow your look like spray it on your lawn right kill your fucking lawn won't it about that it's fake long I don't know nobody mean if you if you have crops in your backyard say say if you're growing tomatoes and you decide to water it with ocean water would that be a bad idea yes it would the salt would be terrible for it right what is that I would just the salt would stay everything else is just here it's like I don't think that's exactly what rest is but the term is some sort of fucked up chemical compound that isn't grass well hard water it kind of poison it it'd be the higher salt content than the the plant wants to exist on I think that'll be the case with a lot of stuff that doesn't live in the ocean right so you'd have to figure out a way to get that salt out but once you did that water be super valuable like we're ways low on water just and we have too much of it now start sucking out of the ocean just use our own need to like we have a crazy need to use stuff you know a constant need we have a constant need for consumption so let's consume the water in the ocean suck it out they they do it's just very expensive in us like they do it in San Diego I think there's a salt water plant yeah but yeah we just gotta get better at that yeah I need a better process for it yeah see everybody's concentrating all the money is in robot fuck dolls I'm not spending any time working on this water problem Elon Musk's get on top of this he long bro you gotta figure this out Elon it could be done and cancer - cancer first I think cancer can be severely medicated in some circumstances by diet and I think that's the thing to concentrate on first before a pill Brian that's problem CRISPR CRISPR imagine there was a way you could just eat shit all day and be jacked they carry my walkins but no port your don't even say that 30 pounds well let's explain to everybody what you're talking about so we do that kill Tony show and Jeremiah Watkins and Tony Hinchcliffe kind of copied like you know like the Tom Segura formula but backwards to see how much weight they can gain in a month Tony did the like working out and trying to gain muscle weight where Jeremiah just ate like shit for 30 days and gained 30 pounds in 30 days where Tony only gained 2 point 5 pounds I think it was yeah it says just over 3 pounds yeah yeah 30 pounds - Tony Hinchcliffe who gained just over 3 pounds Jeremiah 1 now get the host kill Tony show and keep his hair yeah the bullshit was the bet though and one of the most funniest nights I've had in a long time was you calling out Tony about Al it's not fair if Jeremiah lost he had to shave his head well this is what I thought I said this is not an even bet like you guys should both be betting the same thing like if Jeremiah wins all he does is get to sit down in a seat for like a day he has to host an episode of the podcast he gets to sit in a seat so everybody knows it's funny but if he won or if you want he has to shave his fucking head like that's crazy and Jeremiah has nice long hair where Tony has really short hair would have grown back in like a day know Jeremiah's hair seems like kind of a part of who he is yes absolutely scat silly air it's just big silly fella mm-hm and he likes his haircut he just but he was willing to do it and I told Tony I was like fuck that I go look dude you got it you guys got the same bet I got why he's scared to shave your hair to be amazing how about this how about even better you don't shave your head if to wear lipstick on stage for a year Tony said that didn't Tony bring it up that was my joke you don't remember what I did I I said it and then after I was trying to force him into doing because he didn't want to do it I go you know what's fucked up it was Tony's idea I just threw a bridge I was like I don't know why you want to wear lipstick man this is weird oh my god remember I was saying that everybody was dying laughing the reason why everybody was dying laughing cuz they knew I was just fucking with them I was like it was his idea which is so weird no but the idea was you'd have to go onstage and then once you're on stage you have to put lipstick on or we would decide that you had to have it on when you walked out to the crowd either or we didn't decide and then you could take it off after 15 minutes so if you were doing like a headliner set somewhere you do in an hour for the first 15 minutes you're wearing makeup so I said but here to think about that's the thing about that beautiful red lipstick is that it would make you concentrate on a joke about why the fuck you were willing to make a bet how you lost the bet what we know and then rationalize rationalize away about none wrong how come chap sticks okay the lips did gain you know how come girls get the word lipstick bro what the fuck are we doing man what is this dad been so funny if he had to wear lipstick for a year it would've been hilarious he wouldn't it was I told them I would do it - I'll do it - come on we all do it together don't be scared take it bet yeah it's not a hard bed it's funny you'd have to you'd have to like to have the lipstick year's photos every time we're on stage you just what you have you have like like a package of wet wipes with you bring on stage and a dry white towel and everybody knows you have 15 minutes a lipstick time you might grow to like it you know you might start getting out nails did and everything you definitely could come up with bits from it it could be possible and it would be fun for people to like go along with but Tony can't handle that it's on you scared like he's scared that I think he said I least shave his head he should have shaved said he should have had a deal obviously he has way more beautiful hair than I do and but I feel like if I had good hair I'd shave it off because I knew it'd come back it's super tony has super shows you so that's Eddie Izzard is Eddie Izzard and lipstick and is Eddie Izzard living as a woman now some of you so told me that I yeah yep well it's not necessarily living as a woman looks like Eddie Izzard with lipstick and a dress I don't know any hazard will have my respect for for all his days because Eddie Izzard ran a marathon a day with no training all around Ireland do you know about that sigh no dude he didn't prepare for it he didn't even prepare for it just finish him yes he did it all Wow he wrote a marathon a day for like four weeks or something crazy right wasn't it dude his feet were literally falling apart like they would show them cleaning up his feet and taking care of his skin it was just torn to pieces man it was just straight raw mental toughness and a resolve that I mean you think about him you think about him as a comedian a funny guy a thoughtful guy and he had that odd thing that he was doing where he was wearing women's clothes and all that stuff 27 marathons in 27 days yeah you don't you don't really know what that guy's about until you watch this documentary that you could watch online what is it is there a name for it where people could search it it's amazing man you'll find it so what he did was I don't I don't even remember what the charity was do you member what the charity was it was some sort of a charity if he did the 27 marathons I think he only took a couple days off like there here and there there were days where he literally couldn't couldn't walk he had he did this twice to Jesus he did 43 marathons in 51 days oh my god what oh my that might be the new thing he did it again I bet it was Marathon Man oh my god so he did it before he did less and then he came back and did it again somebody told me about it a few years ago but it was after the fact I didn't know he's done it twice kinds of fucking animal he's an animal I mean that's just crazy but then I read something unrelated I read something that he was living as a woman but he might just feel like we're in a dress that day he's Eddie Izzard you run fifty three marathons whatever the fuck he did you do whatever you want dude and his dick fell off I don't that this in 2016 and then the first one was in 2009 ah okay that makes sense because the 2009 one I think I found out about around 2012 or something like that I remember watching it thinking that's that's a kind of mental toughness that very few people have I don't think I have it to run that many marathons in that many days not anyone you might have to force yourself into that like day two in the last day Jesus Christ what he ran a double marathon on the last day so that was the toughest day of my life holy shit dude if I've had to take off to go to the hospital we had to make up one oh my god he had to go to the hospital to get his kidneys checked out so on day 27 I ran my 26th and my 27th marathon double marathon on the last day so that was a toughest day of my life I'm telling you man that is not a regular person a guy who's not like a cam Hanes type guy who's in shape who can just do like ham Haines can run a marathon a day and it's not hard like if he no bullshit if he wanted to go and do 27 marathons in 27 days he'd be like yeah I've done that already he could just do it he can go do that but but anyone is 'red was not he wasn't planning for that he like he didn't get in shape before he did it unless he did the second time I might be wrong about the second time but the first time he did it he didn't get in shape for it and to see him running those 27 marathons it's just like it's all just mental toughness he just forced his body to keep moving what does it say here he's going into politics in 2020 Yoshi king of the world and he is rude he maybe he's the first print transgender president if he decided to go for it to be born here that would fix it well president of where they live he also did all these marathons in South Africa where the weather was a bit hotter you know yeah listen to D Antwoord music ducking crocodiles Wow so he's gonna go into a yeah his reasoning here he says that's why I pulled that up Wow so he's doing these races just to get people to pay attention yes the messages behind he's not really racing that's interesting Wow interesting he's a very thoughtful guy and but what impressed me the most is not just like the words that he strings together and how he says things which is always impressive but someone who can do that like that is not normal that's extraordinary because he's he's it would be extraordinary for someone who's in great shape like a person who is like a you know world-class like that Courtney dull Walter lady if she ran 27 marathons in 27 days it would still be remarkably impressive it is just the amount of time that you have to spend running every day for 27 days that shit is impressive that's just impressive but to do it when you're just a guy who's a comic I did not even in shape he wasn't even he wasn't even thin you have like like a bit of a belly but he wasn't lean by any stretch of the imagination and didn't look like a runner does he still did comedy I don't know I feel like I haven't seen her heard about him in a long time I think we're guilty over here of not paying attention to what happens in comedy anywhere else in the world you know I somebody has like beat me over the head with somebody that's really funny from somewhere else for me to pay attention I just saw that they have roast battle now in UK there goes Eddie Izzard believe me tor not that it matters we're fine off he's a woman shows in French whoa of course he's a genius guys doing shows in French this show is in French this shows in French orso's fuck man I'm gonna go there with those Google pixel headsets translate it yeah man that's that's where originally I got the idea of us being able to communicate with plants I figured this is step one step one is the Google pixel earbuds that let you listen to someone speak Spanish and real-time translated to English step two is they figure out some sort of a universal code that the plant world is willing to accept and we start communicating back and forth to the plant world step three they develop a headset some sort of a neural interface with a human being and they put this thing on and you go out to the forest and you communicate with the trees that's frequency I say that a hundred percent why not ja I have to do is get them to they're obviously communicating with themselves there's some form of communication between plants this has been proven there's a bunch of weird shit they do like they change the way they taste based on whether or not they hear things going on in the distance that here's someone eating them in the distance and they'll change the way they taste they catch things downwind like the smell of them getting consumed by another animal will change the way they test like that was it the case with the Keysha bush and giraffes they found out giraffes that we're eating these acacia bushes upwind upwind when it's downwind yeah down upwind when they would eat them the smell of them consuming them would come downwind and it would change the flavor profile of all these other trees they would turn nasty-tasting to avoid the giraffes from eating them that's crazy dude so then then they figured out that they could play the sound of caterpillars munching leaves right next to the tree and it would have the same effect Wow yeah so somehow or another they know what it sounds like when they're eating or if they try everything like we're gonna have sex with this tree and just see what happens or tickle the tree vegans are super not happy about plants being alive and thinking you bring it up they get so triggered it is one of the most triggering things this plant intelligence research because they want to claim moral superiority they want to claim that you know lalala I can't hear the plant yes that cabbage is screaming when you pull it out of the ground you fuck screaming for its family the interconnectedness with the mycelium and the soil it's beautiful yeah that but I think what's gonna fix veganism honestly is that robot meat that that artificial lab created meat that's going to fix it we're gonna realize like you all use healthier this way your body has more vitality it's gonna be extinct veganism it's gonna be extinct in a few yeah as soon as they come up with super ethical meat there's gonna be no reason for it everybody's gonna go what's T and I feel so much better when I eat steak it's just fuck like it's it's there's obviously a reason while we're having all this debate it's not like it's crystal clear one way or another it's like it's not good that an animal died so that you live that's not good doesn't feel good but it's not good if they get overpopulated either like yeah that's not good either you know what I was reading this thing about there's an animal call that our dad it's like a sheep and they imported them to Texas a long time ago and they don't taste good to eat apparently or maybe a lot of people are eating in the wrong way so because of that they don't hunt them a lot or if they do hunt them it's not like the same way they hunt whitetail deer or something like that and they live in these like difficult to get to remote parts of like West Texas and shit and so then some of them the ranchers have taken to like firing guns out of helicopters to get rid of them like this is crazy like you have animals that you're you're hunting with helicopters that you're brought over here from another place when they look like just like they're cool-looking man they look like some sort of a Star Wars type goat creature sheep creature they have the amazing horns they use enormous horns but apparently they just can't figure out a way to make them taste good this is from everybody that I know that's tried to eat them give it to an Asian they'll figure it out it's a probably good call I wonder if this is there must be somebody that thinks they taste good and those that do but pull up a picture of an our dad sheep it's like what you looking for I have an Aussie sheep no no it's like it's called our dad they're like one of the few animals that are like universally thought to taste like shit Wow from people that hunt them but they're here and they have to control their population so what do you do about them what do you do about wild pigs we do about animals that get to the unless you want to let predators loose that's it right there that picture oh that's a stone sheep no it's our dad it's like how'd you spell it yeah I only have a picture of those fuckers our dad hunt Texas typing that because they're very popular to hunt in Texas but I don't think a lot of people who I would doubt hunt Texas yeah mmm those are deer that's not the same thing how do you spell that I would add word none of these things are that would add how a dad has like big thick horns say it to Siri and see what shootings well either way what what would you do with all that if we did figure out a way to never have an animal suffer again but we could all eat meat what would you do with all the animals that existed that would be a giant dilemma like how many people would say yeah you know what that's all well and good but I want a cow that just got killed I want a real cow that's really alive it makes me think and feel better would have to add is that it hmm that's some sort of feral sheep Paulo para that's weird they don't have our dad maybe try a different spelling like our dad sheep hunt Texas anyway well the delicate balance of like prey and predator like how do you manage that you if you have certain populations these animals just run and loose somebody sent me a video that's it I took the word off Texas go back to that last one you had that's exactly what it looks like look at that thing looks like the devil right those horns that's like some Satan shit from Damien it's weird that meat is not just meat that like you can't just like take that leg off and eat it nope it's definitely different some people say goat is delicious but I think it really depends upon the diet of the goat some goats the weird shit and they taste terrible and some some goats they you know um delicious plants and you eat them and I bet it tastes as good as anything you're gonna eat it really it varies so much between the people that say it tastes amazing versus the people that say it tastes terrible that's a perfect example of one that looks like something from Star Wars look at that it's crazy-looking but what would you do so if we did figure out a way to have all of our meat come out of a laboratory so nothing has to die what do we do about all the animals zoo laughter that's not right that's even crazier like did not have a ranch instead of a zoo animal island dude that's it that's the island we were talking about we ship all the animals to like some giant cut like New Zealand make a deal with New Zealand we're gonna bring over lions bro but say with no predators that like Jurassic Park basically yeah exactly yeah you'd have to bring over predators too you'd have to create a wild ecosystem just a fully wild ecosystem and just everybody out we there's so many people by the year 2099 that we we've occupied every single stretch of the world and everything looks like New York City except one continent which is like Central Park for the world so the world is now one enormous city but we've maintained like the Amazon the Amazon rainforest is what we cherish that's our last connection to mother earth before we completely slip in to some symbiotic relationship with computers we're allowed to visit this island and little hamster balls oh yeah dude just like Jurassic Park this could be real I mean this literally it sounds crazy but you're talking about five hundred years from now we literally could have occupied every single part of the earth except for one place we literally could make some sort of a deal though like when nobody goes the Amazon thing could be a great science fiction movie feel free to see it steal it Dark Mirror I think we need to start building underwater underwater city fuck that do you imagine your underwater see a little crack in the wall you're coming home you're on edibles and you're so tired you have to be at work at three hours and you look and you see a little just a small crack in the world and you go do I talk about this crack I tell it maybe it's just a flaw in the glass it just looks like a crack and then as you're as you're going back home at the end of your shift it's just I'd rather do this and then Mars I trust underwater cracks more than going in a Tesla to Mars just a feeling of all the walls exploding instantaneously and billions of gallons of ocean water crushing your very existence instantaneously it's over Shaboom just the smash of the ocean hundred feet deep around you crushing everything as soon as that crack gets big enough I'm freaking me out so you would do Mars no I want no I'm not doing anyone get any of it fuck themselves yeah submarine I want to see Nemo at Walt Disney that was a fun ride great for little kids Finding Nemo you go out in the little submarine and they have a little show they do for you it's wonderful that's about as good as it gets I know he's how about that one lady who was a reporter who went the guy's submarine and he killed her and chopped her up decapitated her like what the fuck you imagine if you're a lady and you go out there and you're looking to do a story about a guy who made his own submarine and then somewhere along the line he kills you and chops you up and throws you in the ocean you've got to think like when you're going to interview a guy who made a submarine there's no way this guy's gonna chop me up yeah that's not gonna happen he knows that everybody knows I'm going to visit him I kind of believe his excuse a little but then I you know that where the the hatch just closed on her head yeah but you're supposed to tell people yeah you know it's supposed to chop her up and throw in the ocean and pretend nothing happened get activists did you just tell everybody who's a horrific accident and you feel terrible and you get punished and fuck man poor lady eleven days to think about it though he had a sort of reading right now as you guys are saying it her torso was found 11 days later well first you said she died of carbon monoxide poisoning he previously had said the thing hit her hit her head is a 150-pound hatch door oh Jesus Christ did you imagine that oh my god that makes men's hatch door hitting your head makes sense but either way fuck submarines dude fuck submarines right you have any desire to go bungee jumping nope I'm scared I don't want any of that fuck all that right the squirrel suit doesn't sound terribly what sounds kind of fun you did this squirrel so wouldn't do it it sounds funny wanna fly sure you let me know when you can do that so I could prepare for your absence forever life insurance policy I don't land and these dumb fucking call your two o'clock in the morning all lit up try to get you to jump off the Alps if you ever get to suit with some Jets on it I might be what if that goes wrong well if that's like the Tesla door Oh handles it want to open it so come on man don't do it I know you want a parasail anymore yeah but hang gliding is I've heard of people like getting shot up in a hang glider 300 feet in just a little like spout of air that they can't control and you're fucked on that I'll call that crazy this is all that for thrills for wild thrills and god dammit we're going to have flying cars though that's another thing they're looking into there's a lot of people that are seriously considering flying cars right now I think it's a matter of time before they lock that down I think it's gonna be automated pilots I mean driverless cars first in that technology then flying I think you're totally right I think they're gonna have the same sort of like Lane Departure warnings and all the stuff that keeps cars from crashed into each other the correct and that people are just gonna say well as long as they're autonomous it's it actually makes it more efficient to use the entire 3d space and not have the the landscape marred with all these hard roads I haven't been a bummer today have I I feel like I'm a freaking me out I don't know why I'm more serious about this shit heading into 2018 but it just seems ominous dumb dumb dumb all right I got a piece so bad we have to wrap this up I've been holding it in yeah I checked too much coffee before this one yeah almost three hours all
