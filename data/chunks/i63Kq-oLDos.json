and all of a sudden pull back I don't know that I don't know if it's corruption III I think it's uh you don't know if it's good in other words what I mean is I just think that the system in place is the only way yeah that's yeah so I mean they're not gonna fix that system if that system has made them billions of dollars they're gonna do whatever meager patch work they need to do within their lifetime to keep on the majority of the wealth David I've said before try try getting rid of a law now try yeah try let's let's skip but let's step outside of the boundaries because I of these these questions and these these these things and one of the reasons why I tire of it is because everyone seems to have some sort of a position in this machine and everyone is you know describing all the the varieties of you know issues within you know these positions of these these different statements and different belief systems that everybody has a subscribe to when it comes to this world and how everything runs what's the ideal way to do it what if you could if you were a guy and I know that you've thought of this if you were a guy that could stop everything and figure out how to make an even system what would you do how would you engineer it if someone came up to you and said listen dude we're gonna let you go on television you have a year to formulate a plan I think you're a smart guy and I think this is what the world needs the world's needs a smart dude who thinks out of the box you get together you have one year come up with a fucking plan as to how to redistribute the whole thing how to refigure out where where the money gets stored and what's the monies based on and you know what are what are acceptable interest rates and I would probably do I would probably start with a flat tax and what I mean by that is I would have no matter who you are where you stand you pay 30 percent you pay 30 percent across-the-board so instead of having 6,000 pages of taxes I know there are problems with it but for the most part I'd make it as fair as possible may not be as fair that you know rich people pay more they're gonna pay more ultimately but you know poor people still have to pay 30 percent right now a lot of poor people don't pay any taxes at all maybe that's good see this is where I would have stood down the tax code is so fucking complicate that I might just say flat-tax across the board no matter who you are you pay 30% of your income I I think if you are poor and you are struggling you should have to pay much less and I think that a guy like me should have to pay more I think that I I agree with that I think it's it's a creepy argument and I I this is the caveat though if I believed that it was being spent wisely if I believed it that was the answer and I don't this brings me back to the do that did the question is that I don't believe there's any way I don't believe that any large bureaucracy I don't care if it's a corporation especially not the US government cuz there's no accountability and you don't have to have a bottom line you don't have to produce a profit you there's no there's no marketplace telling you you go out of business I mean right since what was it 1960 fucking that is a problem it's a business there's no confrontation 500s are 500 companies that were in existence it started when they started to track in the fortune 500 hominid are in existence since 1967 how many in the Aaron is just said the 500 I believe eight are still running companies go out of business all the fucking time why they just run out they just run out of product to inspiration whatever leadership that's how it goes leaves room for another startup yes yes where that hasn't happened the pharmaceutical industries they're so fucking big that they controlled the FDA a whole nother sort so the point is this my feeling my feeling is that the only way that you are always going to have private look at look at the military-industrial complex you're always gonna have private sector people manipulating tax dollars and government agencies to their to their benefit then and as a result it's impossible for the government not to get involved in the marketplace it's impossible you don't have a free market you don't have a market system anymore especially not in the banking industry it's been regulated since fucking 1900 it so what I would do very simply is I'd have a flat tax and I would ultimately get rid of all subsidies all except for Medicare Medicaid and that I would hover and including Social Security I would overhaul in that I would find out who deserves fucking Medicare there are a lot of very wealthy people who get it this shows all of a sudden become a really boring political science it's a debate the issues I'm sorry but it goes on forever you got real specific with your points and we starting to figure so talk about the corruption in Avon corporations Avon yeah pink car yeah that's a pink car down to what general thing people understand I think you just gotta realize just always ask yourself how the fuck would I react in that situation if you really learn about the stuff how this shit is you get into these guys these guys get into stuff like that guy's fuckin evil and in movies you see the evil guy with the black hat shit's always way more complicated and way more fucking greater than well it's also because corporate unum you've seen the documentary is a corporation right with a detail how corporations act as sociopaths they act as Psychopaths they ask these people who don't care about the repercussions because there's a diffusion of responsibility this is a million people in the corporation there you go deep shit guys yeah it's what I think you know when I look at what's going on right now I I see a bunch of different factors and the big factor that I think is not being paid as much attention to and all this is that it the whole problem is the access to information and that this system has always been corrupt and the system has always been run unfairly but we didn't know it we didn't know it the way we know it now and the access to information is unprecedented now and because of that people are starting to exchange information and because of this access to information and social networking they're allowed to do it in real time and they're organized it's also easy to manipulate you know you got you have so much access to information it's really easy to manipulate you see political parties do that shit all the time sure of course yeah eventually it's gonna there's gonna be something that allows people to know whether something not is true and that's when things gonna get really strange and it's really not that big of a deal to be able to exclude disinformation and incorrect information to have some way of proving things to be factually correct before they release and spread their will that's not that far outside of the realm of possibility so right now there's a it's whether or not you can prove something to be true and factual you know that that you know like when you look at like these databases like Wolfram Alpha and you know like Siri the the Siri thing we talking to the Apple thing and it goes to the web and finds information and brings it back to you there's going to eventually be a very clear system of finding out what is true and what is not true there's gonna be it's gonna be very easy to detect what is propaganda what is actual fact and you're gonna be able to know it in real time and when that happens then it's gonna be way harder to pull off corruption yeah well that's what I just keep wondering like I was find myself asking how things gonna get better in 20 years worse how about its better listen man here's what everybody's what was being about man you know there was a study recently that I tweeted there talked about violence that it was a kurtzweil study violence is at an all-time low in per capita like people are much much less violent and much its life today is much safer than it's ever been at any other time in human history things are getting better it's just right now I think we are in the process of a birth we're in the process of another stage and it's really close to bottlenecking there's with the the influx of Technology and information into the world of the monkey is is so complete right now and we are biologically struggling to keep up with all this new shit that's going on around us all the time and all this new information and all these new challenges and all these you know the these new issues that are presenting themselves to us and that's everything because of Technology yeah it almost feels like you know they're talking about the planet and it's warming and all 7i I always feel like is that is that essentially like the idea that we keep growing as like literally an organism where we're gonna have to mess with machines just to survive and yeah it's all kind of part of it you know well there's also the idea that machines are a life form in and of itself are they you look like I've always said this if you look at like I'm stupid I could keep old computers I have like an old gray one of those tan Apple fucking towers it's in my garage somewhere doesn't work anymore I have an old laptop with a little track wheel on it that doesn't work anymore either those are skeletons those are dead animals those are things that they they're their predecessors you know or rather they were there or they are the predecessors from the today's sleek laptops right you know they're their old shity the big clunky they make weird noises when you turn them on you know I mean they're essentially the monkeys of you know yeah in comparison to us yeah and I I think it's real possible that if we do have some sort of an artificial intelligence and we do create a life form out of computers its able to recreate other life forms I think that's probably the next stage why are we so we personally think that it's so important that we continue this this animal struggle with emotions and sperm and eggs and biology as we know it well biology is we're know it might be a our own biology we might be much more comfortable inside of a robot but I was going to say I mean but but that but human beings it seems they're on the verge of actually creating a whole a whole new kind of bio synthetic biology that we're gonna be able to mess with who's to say that that synthetic biology can't be just as way better or better way better man this is like we have is like an old car that's made out of cardboard that's and we're on our way to building some fucking carbon fiber you know we'll fiber optic laced electronic fucking mid-engine beast you are constructing ears they can hear a mile away I'll take it the problem is it keeps raining and our fucking cardboard house is slowly falling apart we're like Jesus Christ hurry up fix this cardboard car is the cardboard cars all fucked up and the new cars not ready yet well it's a matter of whether or not we can complete our cycle of technology and artificial intelligence and then combined with it or blow ourselves up the brain the ear drum the eye the red blood cell we just reverse engineered the red blood cell of a dog and that means that if you reverse engineer it and you know exactly how it works you can make a replica of it with synthetic material and which would be a nanobot because it can it's about that big so so panel nanotechnology and then re replicating what you just reverse engineered if you can do that then it is it is clear and it follows by the way we're also doing with an i we're doing it with an ear drum etc if you can do that well when is the brain when they're already working on trying to reverse engineer the brain it really fucking raises really cool questions it really does men because if you can do that and you can create a machine it's the Bladerunner question when does it become a person you know when what's a fucking what's-her-name and Blade Runner the really cute Chuck Daryl Hannah when she cried when she was sad didn't you feel sad for her she's beautiful yeah she's a robot robot that wants some dick and she can kill you like is that cheating yes and it's gonna happen what's gonna happen cuz the robots gonna go to your house and kill your wife cuz your wife wants unplug it you know robots have emotions bro they build a man if they build an emotion if they're gonna build then something's gonna be kind to you the only way kindness counts is if you earn it kindness if you're just an emperor and you walk in and everybody just sucks your dick after a while that shit gets boring you know the yin and the yang of things is there for a reason you have to have struggle in order to appreciate the good times you cannot I don't appreciate relaxing unless I put in hard work I really don't that's that's the biggest question with a lot of computer scientists who are saying when these robots develop will which means they when you say that when they develop consciousness meaning they are conscious of their own existence the nature of anything that it's conscious of its own existence or even just having its own existence whether it's a cancer cell and ant or a human being is that you want to replicate and stay alive forever mm-hmm and and you know right but those are biological instincts of a crew because they're they're programmed into the world that we operate they are creating computers are going to be essentially the exact dominica we are mimicking ourselves not necessarily true because there's no benefit to staying alive what what benefit does the computer have to maintaining consciousness if there's no if there's no cells or genetics or hormones pumped into your system telling you stick it in there and shoot off loads because you want to breathe through what what is where's the incentive what happens there's not the computer if it's infinitely wise doesn't embrace the notion that it does not have to be a complete because what it is is a part of everything in the first place and there's the idea of life is not really necessary it's just we hold on to it because biologically it's how we spread our work that's interest we spread our work doesn't matter anyway the computer should be smart enough to know go ahead shut me off bitch I'm here forever well then what about when they start making computers that are smart than them and all that will they become infinitely smart almost immediately I think the people I said well if they're gonna have respect for our biological heritage and what they don't realize we're gonna be changing too that's what we're gonna be changing yes of course I feel similarly when you start talking about computers being in this advanced you're talking about human beings because I'm gonna tell you right now as soon as they gonna biochem a mcdowell compatible machine that I can download information into etc you're gonna you're gonna have it in your box well I'm attached already to my fucking phone my phone is a part of me when I leave my house and I don't have my iPhone I feel like I'm missing a part of my body and you know if you read Tim Ferriss book did you read the part about having a cell phone in your pocket how it cooks your fucking balls well one of the things that he did was he did a test on his sperm count and he did a test and found out that a sperm count was fairly low and he's in really good shape and he's young and he was like what the fuck is going on so then he starts doing all this reading and on different studies and one of the things he comes to his studies about cell phone usage and keeping your cell phone in your front pocket and how it affects your sperm count the radiation from your fucking cell phone diminishes your sperm count yeah he doesn't even carry it on him anymore you like he shuts it off good anyway um but I have in my pocket all the time and he said that he took took the time off stopped having the phone in his pocket started eating Brazil nuts apparently they have zinc in them and it's they're very healthy for bringing back your sperm count by the way just a misnomer for everybody listening Brazil nuts can also be very very allergic my mother and my mother will die sheets one if I if I want one my whole throat closes I'm gonna eat some right in France Brazil not to show your superior just make sure yeah so I'm good good call um so either I take zinc supplements or do whatever the fuck to ferrous did and by taking the phone out of his pocket he you know radically increases sperm count that's character I don't know I don't know what chapters it I read it on the toilet so I pick it up and I read it for instance I've been eating so well my toilet trips have been shorter and shorter I used to you know when I was just eating straight meat Brock Lesnar stop Oh take these giant dinosaur shits that would take twenty minutes and I would look just like Ari Shaffir is jug code my legs would go numb my feet would go numb I'd have a hard time standing up but I've been drinking this kale shake I make every morning now yeah I cut it with into this crazy Vitamix blender I throw in cucumbers and kale and man I feel so good give so much energy it's really it's a do cashews goji berry some almonds strawberries blueberries and then some hemp seed and and protein powder and almond milk and you feel fucking me I do it I do that the dr. Schultz superfood which is this awesome kelp green thing yeah I I'm telling you man I have energy for days yes incredible yeah man diet is so goddamn important it's one of the things that yeah and by the way I know food tastes fucking delicious you know I'm the first guy after a comedy show especially will go to Canter's and I'll have a giant fucking pastrami Reuben it's all right Ryan so you're getting the nutrition you need most people are walking on malnourished yes and then maybe shit yeah you got it and you're not not just vitamins either I used to try to just do it with vitamins and I think multivitamins are important I think is important to recommend too I don't know if like you know III think certain people with certain demands have higher demands like especially if you're an athlete if you're doing a lot of jiu-jitsu like when people say you know what you need for your recommended daily requirement of vitamins and protein all that stuff I always look at them I go okay but what are you doing physical are you doing what I'm doing man because I'm fighting for my life you know and I don't think people understand that you know I did a thing I'm in men's fitness this month there's a thing on my workout you know they they did this whole thing on my kettlebell workout and Steve Mac Wells maxwell's in town and we're working out this weekend together to I'm super excited about this week gonna do some hardcore kettlebell drills people don't fucking realize how hard some people work out and I don't work out nearly as hard as a guy like Cain Velasquez does or a guy like George st. Pierre does I just simply don't put in the amount of sessions in a week that they do but when I do do it I go fucking all-out and you can't do that and just eat spaghetti no you can't do that and and not have vitamins and not have protein and I'm have one of the things that I've done over the course of being involved in combat sports since I was literally a child you know and I haven't had moment since I was 14 years old that I wasn't learning or practicing some type of martial art it became an obsession super early in my life and there's a direct correlation to me with good performance good movement healthy body mind spirit and diet when I've eaten shares talking about I said food is a drug and how you the way you combine it the kind of food you take in it will react within your body exactly the way a drug will either it will have a positive hormonal effect yes a negative hormones well the problem is good food like there's a lot of shit foods food that's got no nor very little nutrients but god damn it tastes good you know I have a pineapple and anchovy pizza it's one of my big fucking problems I got a problem I like double double pineapple double anchovies sure that's filled with arsenic and all kinds of creepy fucking shit in that ocean that ocean just filled with heavy metal poisoning and anyway it's it's a fucking I got a real problem but after I eat it I feel like shit I always feel like I got harpooned like I get shot with some animal tranquilizer I think that the way that to start eating better is first of all to to educate yourself and start eating better but then just start noticing the difference because what happens is you start getting a pleasurable response when you eat well and what's good for your body and a negative response when you go out and eat a whole pizza at Pizza or whatever you're you you you won't feel as good as if you have a shake I was just talking about my point was this is my point my point is in all my years I've done it both ways I've done it where I eat shit food and I've done it wearing really good food and when I do when I really good food I have a different body it's that simple yeah it works way better it just works way better nobody before they get into the UFC eats fucking three Carl's jr. you know break bacon cheeseburgers and fries and a large coke you just don't do that because if you do your body's gonna perform like shit you know why because your body's fighting out poison your body's in a war to process all this shit saturated fats and trans fats and that's fats with dicks right Brian yes he said with Chad Frank I said favourites what's I was just kidding about taken out with the transvestite and my friends you know somebody needs to uh somebody needs to create a guide for life and have all these different ideas in there and one of them is gonna be the importance of diet and exercise and even though I know a lot of smart fucking people I know so many intelligent people who are really super creative and really interesting they don't take care of their fucking shell they don't take care of their body man they don't they don't understand and they'll look at you like you're frivolous or like you're you know you're there's a lot of negative connotations like what I'll call you a health nut sure you're a health nut oh yeah or you're an exercise freak well no well your narcissistic cuz the inclination is the implication now I just know that I feel way better I'm way more productive one yeah I'm like this then I'm not gonna have a belly when I'm fucking you know 45 50 55 you know they say a certain percentage of people have chimpanzee DNA I have chimpanzee DNA I mean not just chimpanzee DNA rather Neanderthal DNA there's no question about it I got some Neanderthal in my past there's no doubt about it I like a certain percentage of humans some large numbers yeah yeah we we somehow or another assimilated with the Neanderthals they didn't used to think that I don't know no I think you know that that has to do with what part of environment you know your DNA comes from you know whether you or your family were Sicilian peasants that are carrying rocks all day yeah exactly and and endomorphs seem to be a function of society and diet and and also that one of the things they're finding out is stress from inside the womb if the mother during pregnancy is malnourished in any way the kid has an inclination to hold on to carbs and fats and there haha yeah there's uh there was another part of that zeitgeist thing that was really interesting it was a well a lot of that that the psyche is the part that I watched on watch the first fifteen minutes or so and what was really interesting about it was all the different things they were talking about about health and and and cancer and and illnesses and about people who develop breast cancer there's like a gene that you know a lot of people get breast cancer and they can find that gene and say you are susceptible to breast cancer well people who have breast cancer only three out of ten have that gene seven out of ten don't have that you know and they're trying to figure out well what is it that causes people to get cancer what is it causes people to be to to have violent behavior well well what there are other genes for violent behavior yes there are but you know the realizing people who have been abused a childhood have a different genetic structure than people have in their body their body reboots yeah your body cheers to structure can change your body changes to deal with this horrible environment in this horrible hand do you have any doubt yeah it's like the system is is all set up to respond to whatever is coming make sense though you know it's like talking to John Brenkus who does that show sports science and and they were talking about vo max and they were they tried to tire Cain Velasquez out and they had him running oh it's raised they couldn't get his heart rate over 165 it's a beast no matter what they do it they go you fucked with that dog and some of it is that there's definitely like some people have like a certain genetic structure when they hang a utilize oxygen better but a lot of it it's it's also repetition and practice in your body kids incredibly adapt yeah he wouldn't have that kind of cardio if you didn't train now I mean he's got definitely he's got some freak genetics but guess what a lot of Mexicans do yeah a lot of Mexicans have amazing endurance you know Julio Cesar Chavez was known for barely training and he had amazing endurance like it's some of his fights he like you just commented just beat the fuck out of guys break him down to me he never done never just rip your body Gilbert Melendez is the Strikeforce lightweight champion he's a Mexican dude amazing endurance this kid is he's known for just puttin on people and he has even said that he thinks that part of his endurance is genetic it obviously works as hard as any professional athlete on the planet but but those long-distance runners come from Kenya Peru but that's a different that's no inactivity in Peru I'm saying yeah different activity long-distance running is all it's all cardio it's a different it's a different kind of cardio that you haven't fighting where you if I had a little bit anaerobic all mixed in together that's like real combat like sort of cardio it's a different kind of party it's the rawest was this a girl or a guy that was asking this question we didn't grab her by the the nape of the hair in the back of my neck and you just just gently wrap your cock or on their lips slap and then put it back in the pants don't even ever suck it just put it bugging your parents just just to just now for the fuck out of rowdy girl dirty bitch why do I like what but it's it's just so I gotta it's got a little bit of a boner just now but I'm sorry it's it's literally like it's the Ross form a competition of course guys fight yeah you know um that movie warrior did not get its fair shake you were in warrior and you had a great role as a fun role but that movie did not get its fair shake that was a great movie it wasn't even factual you know the it was silly they fought for two days in a row and it was a crazy tournament but that didn't matter that just the story itself and maybe they could have worked around that where they didn't have a two-day tournament or whatever but it didn't matter though the story and the the movie worked it was a good movie it was it was decent it was great and very few that's on tonight is it on tonight Monday at 11:00 nobody's watching it no but it's a great show really what are the knockers watch it tonight I told you I'll do it I want to play a werewolf man I'm you're going to if we get picked up our talks and they love the idea like how good of the special effects I don't want to play i watch ginger snaps last I'll do it there are somebody told me to rent ginger snaps - it's a good mood werewolf movie it's kind of funny for a long time it's pretty funny it's about two girls that are going through high school and they're they're loners they're kind of outsiders and they're sisters and they're kind of goth and one of them gets bit by a werewolf it's pretty fucking funny there's a lot of good stuff to it up until you see the werewolf and it's like Jesus Christ did you have any budget I mean it's just it looks like I took a balloon that drew a werewolf scary face on the balloon and stuck it in your face like that's the world I'm proud of the show and it's on MTV what time and to be 11 o'clock on Monday tonight tonight watch it tonight schedule it on my phone right now specialist car and I think tomorrow we got Josh McDermitt Josh supposed to be doing it because we started doing this thing from the ice house live at the ice house and it's on it's broken up into two parts one part is on my itunes on the Joe Rogan experience and the other part is on death squad and death squad is the one that Brian runs and what it essentially is is it's all of our friends that have podcast like Tom Segura we're talking Bryan Callen is doing one he's gonna do one now - Sam Tripoli does it all these different people do it and we decided - that would be a good way to also promote death squads so we have it set up I'm gonna do it on that red bands and we start Brendon Walsh this week - I think I want to start my podcasts just gonna be I'm gonna have my guess I'm gonna ask them like can your conversationalist just anything that's interesting to you - sit down talk about you you should have a podcast there's no doubt about it you're a fascinating dude and you know and it's gonna be fun and it helps you evolve ideas and people call you on your bullshit and it helps you it also helps you realize like how many times you repeat the same things over and over again how many how many subjects you obsess on and god and it becomes a normal part of your everyday life but when you start trying to pump that out of the podcast people like I heard that already yeah stop fucking freaking out about the same thing every goddamn week you know you got it yeah well we talked about Occupy Wall Street like three times in a row now but I think we're also doing it with different people just to sort of get their different reactions because I think this is a pretty important part of human history right now I think it's funny that you both said that you really like Daniel date what's his name yeah yeah because it's that comes up with all your friends and I miss you guys all sitting and talking about every time I do knuckles up by the way I can't get you out of my head materials like people what inspires you is not even so much the person but the effort you know like when you see that kind of I love excellence yeah me too it's like yeah holy fuck you go beyond yourself there I don't really like soccer but if I see a badass soccer player and show me a clip online I'll watch him I watched him do his thing did you see that guy by the way in South Africa riding his mountain bike his dress and he got hit by that yeah yeah he got hit by a buck with the horns and then he landed on his head and he was making those I've been knocked out noises that you make when you get were severely concussed that's when you know that's when you know so you feel the weight and power of a 440 pound and running full clip hitting it with it's fucking horns you know fuck and then it just kept running it went boom oh whoops I hit a guy and a bike no big deal an accident or no accident he was running he happened to be sprinting and as they're coming down and he just timed it shitty and slammed into him yeah fuck Africa dude Africa can suck my dick insects the size you're fucking for well how about the parasites forget about the flu insects you can see they're about oh whoops I washed my toe and I actually had a hangnail and some shit got inside of it and it camped out of my body and grew and made a chain all the way to my brain and started sucking brain juice out of my big toe and I went to the doctors look why is my big toe leaking oh that's cerebral spinal fluid what the fuck's going on oh there's a pipeline between your fucking brain your toe created by some parasite no maybe I just made it up but maybe there's plenty of shit inside Africa again Africa twice fuck you up I was I was a kid I was now forget it wasn't it was dark out and they were we were staying in this place where there really grounds there were these you could walk around and I was gonna walk around my father ghosts you know walk around there because this is Africa you see a fence around here there lion just over there you idiot fucking rice you don't have a dog in your backyard in Africa for example we've been banging around the idea of cellphones how when you buy a cell phone you know you don't realize how much fucking slave Labor's involved but how much we were zero karma free cell phone is there a cell phone you can buy where you don't have to worry about the labor slave labor you'd have to worry about the minerals mined under you know treacherous conditions where people know it's impossible it's impossible sorry those minerals they're all from the fucking Congo man and the con that was watching Vice guide to the Congo have you seen that yet they started releasing vice guy to the Congo oh Jesus Christ is out a fucking crazy part of the world that is usually watch more than Joseph Joseph Kony who runs the Lord's Resistance Army about 200-300 like vicious killers who do all kinds of horrible things they just go to they just mask or villages he's a delusional guy with military-grade weapons he's been out there for God since the who to Rwanda Massacre and this motherfucker is as bad as it gets and they do the worst shit in recorded history and it's going on right now 2011 people don't realize that millions of people have died oh my god millions it sounds like an exaggeration civil war that civil war has seen that Sierra Leone Liberia to us to a small extent but and and Rwanda has seen some of the most concentrated and ferocious killing in the history of the fucking world whoever you guys are that do that vice guy to travel all you guys are bad motherfuckers and I would love to have you guys on the podcast if someone knows anybody that knows those guys somebody does somebody knows one of the guys on our message board but fuckin holler at me on Twitter those those guys they've done some wild fucking trips man the Liberia one is a great one Thailand one they went to Thailand and picked up ladyboys whoo yeah they went deep just entirely their hangover 2 right dere exact got no idea I was with Zach Galifianakis and Brody Stevens and we were watching the lady boys and some of them are as good-looking as the girl I was making out with from my earlier story better softer lips and I said to Brody I go dude if you have any guts at all you hope you will take that girl home and bang her I know it's a guy but you don't have a stones of course he didn't do it but she was like gorgeous Wow Wow yeah scary world out there do you like Thailand do you think you'd leave leave the country and me and you and a couple other dudes this is the thing we hit 60 after the kids are grown kids leave the house
