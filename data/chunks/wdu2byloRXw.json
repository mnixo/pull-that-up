man I go dude I was I was pretty fucked up man he goes I look at him cuz I'm thinking is like I can't believe how much more advanced you are than me you know it's like like I cannot believe you mean tolerance why yes like it's like I can't believe I ran a mile and you just ran 40 miles like it's crazy to me and we both finished at the same time and then I go so I'm amazed that he's not affected I can't believe how much that fucked me he goes I almost had three panic attacks on that flight yes it made me so happy that he was all so fucked up and he I was like oh he doesn't care he still goes - right back right back in I go I go I'm glad it's starting to wear off he goes not for me I'm fucked up right yeah his idea of going deep is so much deeper than your idea yes he's breaking World Records on a daily basis all the time he's at the bottom of the Marianas Trench with a shovel he's like there's gotta be a deeper spot this is bullshit and the first thing he did as we get off that was like let's smoke this joint I was like what are you talking about what are you talking about man we're not smoking a job take a break he's a major breaks he's a maniac yeah well he just goes through the whole day like that and that's where you know people would step in and say that boys got a problem yeah yeah because for a comedian yeah it might be the best way to live life yeah is scared on a regular basis and in between laughs and your dick off scared laughing your dick off scared laughing a dick off yeah he um he's the lighting is like even his regular cadence it's so is out of the norm for other people yeah that you see people react to him it's more fun to even watch people like at the restaurant next to us react to him then it is almost to watch him like he's talking and I see them like they're like Jesus like this is like a fucking it's like he brought in a pit bull to have lunch here you know I mean they've never seen somebody so intense and animated and saying these crazy things it's like you watched them react to Joey right right right yeah yeah I know what you mean man he's just it's just they don't come along that often no he's a ray they're like well

I think he just walks away yeah I kill end on a strong point huh you want to kill somebody you invite him over for dinner oh great sense of timing yeah amazing it's it's a stand-up timing that he uses like in everyday lot of your life yeah it's like he's never doing an act yeah cuz his act is its life and his life is his act yeah the way he talks is his act totally that's like the best you could ever hope for the best you could ever hope for is like a merging of your ability to be you off stage and on stage yeah I mean I mean look at like who everybody are a lot of people would say it was like you know a total master comedian basically talks in his voice like Chappelle yeah walks up and is like tells you about his day yeah and that's kind of like the highest form right of being a comma because you're like I'm just gonna this isn't even a thing I'm just talking to you yeah and like Diaz is like a version of that we're like he's just being Diaz we know a guy who was a like I talk I tell the story now on stage of the guy who used to drive us oh my god to the airport Wow this is our driver yeah like a regular guy cuz we got the airport so often we use this you know we found it

like you know get in the back and I was like all right cool we get in the back after thinking like that's where it goes down and Steve's like yo this is white Pete I was like what's up white Pete like and then he was called white Pete because they needed to give him a distinction for his name because he was the only white guy that ran with his crew right and he was like we didn't have driver's

was like what's up I'm white people he talked like Snoop Dogg almost oh right and so we're like all right I thought he was like so we're gonna go get it now I was like go get what like I thought we were just doing this in the car wouldn't go get that sack man like oh okay so we started right we'd go 30 minutes in a car we go to the next town over which is for Pierce which is definitely a shittier place right so we're driving through Fort Pierce and we go from a Main Street to like single lane highways you know in Florida there's like oh yeah right so we're on a busy then we go to a single lane that has like canals on each side oh yeah and we drive it and then we go from that to dirt road and then the dirt road off of that dirt road like we're driving down like this is some Forensic Files shit like we're gonna end up on there's a lot of woods yeah la brush Grove is that kind of shit and I was like fuck man and at this point like I'm thinking about like menace to society and like I want to be in that right now but I'm feeling like feeling really white smelly really scared and so and now it's night and it you know it's like because we came over in the evening already so that's pitch black outside and we're on a dirt road off of a dirt road like you could scream there's nobody gonna hear shit and on the dirt road up a gravel path I see a light and the light is from a trailer so we pulled up to the trailer and we get out and it's me Steve and white pete and we knock on the door the trailer and this dude opens the door and he has this black guy it has like six dreadlocks you know each dreadlock is like a size of like a king size Snickers bar he's got six snicker bars coming out of the hair and why he's like what's up pat pat he's like what's up white Pete and they give each other hugs I was like oh fuck like now this really is like totally menace to society shit right but I'm so truck so trying to be cool about it like so trying to be cool about it and then he's like these white boys looking for a sack and he's like yeah we could do that so we go inside the mind you we're looking for $20 right and we'd like with that forever are you drumming how long is it taking this is at the Trevis point it's like we're already 30 miles south why the city we start why would you just say like nevermind after 10 miles because why does it white peaches sell

walk out they leave me in his trailer with two guns and a fucking message to not to shoot everybody but his mother and I just sit there and watch the MTV Video Music Awards and the whole time like every show that comes I just I'm rocking and I'm actually hoping that it's an intruder versus his mom because I feel like if it's his mom she might accidentally shoot her or how is she gonna react to my explanation like pepper just told me to wait here well he's getting some weed for me but I'm not supposed to shoot everybody but you cool with that she's I yeah it happens also like how are you gonna react to this so I fuck I mean I'm having a panic attack we finally they come back I get back in with a we white Pete he drives us back and I'm sitting up again I'm like what the fuck dude that was the worst that ever like I'm fucking terrified he's like yeah him and Pat Pat Stephen Pat became like best friends so they became like like super close like that was like his guy who cooked and I'd be like no dude I don't want to hang out with that bad at all and like six months later when Steve got his license we went he was like you wanna get some weed today I was like yeah yeah yeah so

again like I thought you just have this shit is so this time we went to this but these the thing PAP a scared the shit out of me the first time but that second time he saved our life actually because we went from his trailer the second time where he jumped in the back went to Avenue D which is the fuckin shitty Street in for Pierce like if you're going to like every city you know you have like I don't know whatever city you're in there like that's you ever seen have you been in a street where you see open drug dealing where there's not even some type of a sudden loss Angeles right but but
