what else could it be you just gonna suck up and have my scab exactly and then while I was uh hanging out taking out the stand comedy club maybe the best club in New York but I'm talking to the owner and Pete Lee this comedian and telling my problem and Pete was like you know I had where is it like right underneath the hood of your dick I'm like yeah right there he's like I had something like this once it was like a penile tear have you done anything like rough lately I was like yeah actually I noticed it right after unlubricated anal sex that's when I first noticed it you like but it just didn't go away you're lucky you're alive I'm lucky I'm alive and then I that's what it turned out to be how do you have unlubricated anal sex that's like fucking hard bro I worked with Rickles this summer oh so great my whole objective of those two days was I just want to be shit on by him I just want I was just lobbing stuff in like Don so uh but we're working together two nights so like you know after that we're gonna know each other pretty well you think when you get back to LA we're gonna hang out don't push it yeah you know that I'm waiting for him right just totally but I like Don we're gonna watch my act tonight I really appreciate if you watch my act I am a little busy and I get very involved in politics in Britain but not party politics but this lobbying for this spend money on the young spend money on education system spend money on inspiration make sure that there's a generation of these great engineers and scientists that the America is currently well leading in absolutely and make sure that they're still there make sure and how do you get them how do you inspire them I don't want kids to want to be singers actually particularly on x-factor I don't want them to be famed when there's a survey didn't reach me I think where they said to the load school kids what do you want to be when you grow up and a lot of them said famous famous what do you mean famous you want to walk on the moon don't you you wanted you want to invent the world's fastest computer don't you do you want what do you mean famous you've got to be famous for something so what do you want make you think wherever's on verge of extinction there's articles written about it out the instances of genital crabs have drastically reduced since the implementation of pornographic visual vagina trimming and penis trimming oh wow yeah because people shave their pussies and not me not you let it wild yeah 1% man's got a half Rho peak in it but then the toys are coming to the change room and instead of looking at they'll come and feel your arms like a horse see how fit you are look you up and down like you're just a piece of meat should I put money on him yeah sure it looks pretty good oh it looks a bit flabby nah a bit on the other guy so they'll just check you out and talk until I come and fill you never touch you touch your belly to see if there's strong stuff these are just gamblers just gamblers and then fucking we're and then at them at lumpini the change rooms next to the toy toilets as well says they're coming in for a piece they might come in to fill your ass why yes I see what kind of odds you got pretty much pretty bizarre so a lightning bet is you assign a number and amount of money to each point that the bet goes over or under which means if you lightning bet $1,000 on an over at 180 once you hit the over I get the chills and once you hit the over every single basket that gets hit in the game you win $1,000 every from both two as both teams on a basket from the field is 2 grams Oh a three-pointers three grams every single bet is housing so like the shakes you start to get while you're watching or literally like they're visible it's almost like you know you're having a connection and you have drinks maybe cokes or them won't calm you down and every time a shot goes up it's like and to me it's the purest form of degenerate gambling I've ever seen I brought you something oh those yours do you recognize those reading glasses do you recognize those no I don't you sure yes I think you left those bitches at my house in like 2009 huh uh I think Weesa Loeb left these at your house not your house in the nine the mouth yours I'm confused sure I'm pretty sure yeah I do thanks brother Adam Carolla's gentlemen in a long-running tradition of people leaving shit behind on the podcast Anna Crowe has left behind his glasses oh my goodness Adam I have your fucking glasses it'll talk to you when you're surviving be cute is your spirit animal food and plastic and then eat it and then poop it out and eat it later like I'm take the plastic off need it what Jesus Christ it seems like it could work that's a technique I've never thought I mean if you're going to be like on your own for five days you can eat a bunch of food but wrap it up in plastic and then later poop it out then uncheck it out but then how would you get the nutrients from the food in the first place with your stomach in a piece of black what does this poop it out understand like it and then you poop it I like before you leave for your trip go don't go get stuffed like yeah awesome market or something conversation throwing that's where your poorly thought-out ideas and then too don't tell him stop can't can't tell guy to eat his poop no no he poo I'm saying like eat like a big meal before you're about to leave you Johnny Appleseed would eat his own poop yeah it's called the easy spout second harvest in the Native Americans they maybe take a bunch of like protein bars wrap them up in plastic eat it and then poop it out in a couple days then unwrap the plastic what kind of shit are you really think a fucking whole protein bar in some kind last Dickens make it through your digestive tract and why I just like carry the bars in my backpack and just eat them three days that is later porous understanding of the human digestive tract ever exhibited on a podcast I was trying to figure out what you were saying I thought you're saying eating poop you're not talking about a little baggie of heroin that a drug mules right that's what I was thinking like I'm never gonna make you survive you'll get another hours worth of energy from that little heroin bag what about petite filets hey hey doubts is wrapped in plastic you're gonna die how long has hung kapal been around for well he started aanchal Paul started I've been doing character for years in relationships long before I did him on the radio I didn't to annoy my girlfriend's I mean he was uncle Larry many years ago there was Roger Davis or Roger T and uh this is long before chip there was Roger and Roger had a brother Lester who was burned in a fire and unless it was you got a whole time like all-zero line Lester was burned everywhere but his knees and his toys wear knickers to show off his legs was a whole thing an Uncle Roger an uncle uncle Larry and then emerged into chip who my girlfriend hated so much uh-huh and chip became the fucking uncle a chip would embarrass people I did that literally before I ever thought doing the radio I would be out with girlfriends and embarrass them by doing that like we I'll just be making bad jokes in the cab and my girlfriend uh you know a Jen and even golf a girl just goes just shut the fuck up it's not funny and uh it made me so ha ha ha happy and what this is what would drive Jen crazy we'd be like a really nice steak house and the way to attend over and she would order like the salmon and then chip just goes how much is that it would ask the waiter right she was like do you know how it is that people think I fucked that guy people think I'm fucking this guy wasn't going to talk about the so-called philosophical issue of how long one we want to live I find it quite remarkable that people worry about this simply because it's not the way that people actually think about anything else when people ask you these things else I don't say okay take yourself back to the first time you got laid oh yeah all right now don't go think about what you were thinking at the time were you thinking oh my god oh my god I have to get this person into bed right now because I've only got another 60 years to live so I mean it's just ridiculous that the difference between the feeling you get when you hear oh it was brain damage I sort of had that feeling about everything you know if you if we if he gets a brain scan if he goes to trial now he gets a brain scan we and we find that his brain is just massively damaged in all the right areas that would have eroded his impulse control right that would seem to let him off the hook a little bit he would he would look like someone who was unlucky more than he would look like a bad person right and I sort of see bad people as unlucky too I mean I recognize that there's certain people who are quite classically bad people they're Psychopaths who you just not only can you not rely on them you you can rely on them to be bad actors you know so you have to you have to be in a posture of self-defense with respect to these people but I do view them as unlucky on some fundamental level and and hair was more of like an eyelash for the vagina for periods and stuff so it wouldn't get everywhere and that's why girls are that's not what it is the the butthole hair was always disturbing though yeah nobody ever liked the Buddle hair because some girls just did not know what they were doing when it came to wiping and back then nobody had a bad day and nobody had baby wipes it was toilet paper sometimes some of its stuck around they get a little ice about sex jokes for a little GI Joe figure super tightly rolled up look at this is hilarious boy this is so bizarre watching Kevin get out of

just wait I'm gonna give you the this is interesting oh so he's he knows he's go ahead it's freaking me out look now we got the bar oh no it's hard watching us watching them this is fucking strange I think we can time-travel somehow I think you just did look what we're doing here was showing his dick again back to his table dick Joe's got a full head of hair what's good this is also bizarre it's like a mailbox or whatever that maybe was my voice just got deeper just Ginger's trying too hard Ariana's got a straw hat on Maryann is she's the girl in the barn giving out hand jobs no no no you

Howell you gotta bring her a lot of jewelry but you marry her oh look at that yeah look at Mary Ann's body in that house holy shit she had that 70s body - a little wider in the edge a little thick at the top of the leg but the flat ass belly with the recessed belly button oh my god any shots of the feet Joe Walsh is first of all an absolute king like let me tell you is one of the nicest guys I've ever opened for he's like so cool you think he'd be Joe Walsh like hey I'm in the Eagles who the fuck are those he it wasn't like that at all but we were eating a deli tray and he comes into the dressing room and he says hey don't eat that shit and we're like what like uh you you don't know what's in there man you know it's just a shitty deli tray don't eat it he's all I got sick before and I was like oh really and he goes yeah let me tell you he gets after he was out of the Eagles he had a real low spot where he is partying hard and cancelling gigs all the time so he cleaned up and the manager said we're booked a tour but if you cancel one show all the shows will be gone so the first night of the tour he's backstage eating on the deli tray after soundcheck and about a couple hours later he gets mad food poisoning and he starts just shitting and and shitting and he's like what am i I got a cancel on the manager goes you cancel this gig the entire tour is going so they go to Kmart or whatever was open and they get the rubber fishing waders he puts them on the ones that go up to your tits then like we river runs through it fly fishing yeah he gets on stage and just starts going at it why he's shitting like every couple like every few minutes is shitting into rubber rubber wettest then he said mid-show he didn't expect this but the heat from the lamp started burning the the diarrhea acid on his legs it was like I know I looked at Joe Walsh we were wearing those because he wore weird shit all right like there's a wacky show tonight shitting himself with where's our cuz sometimes mean regular fresh like Oh tell me your fart smell like sounded like last night I thought yesterday I you know when you stay away from seafood for a while and then reintroduce it there's bacteria in like you know that's different even shellfish and sushi and I I thought when I yesterday when I farted it sounded like somebody was throwing up like the fart sounded like a guy going ah you know I've only shaved my ass once yeah in my lot but once I did oh my god my fart sounded so different really oh they were like wet and sloppy as a hair kinda different oh you're you're the hair in your ass literally changes the way your fart smell or sound rather right smell they smell the same but they sound different my plop plop something tells me King a stripper doesn't shave that's a whole new hair you could get intense a whole monster come that guy he magic dating that guy no he doesn't have a girlfriend never girlfriend no he scrapes up is YouTube like add video money then then he gets a hooker and she's known that farts on her that's like no I hate it fucking loser my videos I'm poor people oh you wouldn't even be him right well what no you don't and then you come out of it and you slowly come out of it and you were like noise cancelling headphones I'm just in a doctor's office like in a weird not even wear like those like 1970s doctor's offices that you see in LA like just sort of a shitty elevator and whatever so when I came out of the first one I was like it was rough because I I didn't know I was going to trip like that and be I had been I didn't get a ton of sleep the night before and so I was and I'd flown that day I was just kind of groggy and and I felt really shitty and it took me like I was like after done I probably laid in the bed there for like an hour so I was like I can't do shit right now like I can't I could barely stand so the first day was rough and and that night I still felt shitty that night I was like I don't think I'm gonna do it again like that was too rough and um then I woke up Tuesday morning and felt fucking great I was like uh I got to do it again 666 podcast dunk and he do it ever you want it could be only one for the 600 always being that yes you did you ever have a girl you dated kill herself no hey should I put that fucking helmet dratted where do you fucking dick hit yourself you should kill yourself the first time and when you get to your destination I'll say Kieran yeah she was cool smart Oh school she was he well I did know she was cute yeah no she's alright smart girl I wouldn't go with fucking great with the greats and tents latent it might be a little time too much of a big word do I be a little hyperbole they're never seen one reports about that fuck oh I haven't well I got admit if I I swear to God I have never seen her not one you never seen her worked not a while dear you not do reason I wear it for that episode yeah well I know she's my winix I know dancing yeah she does some heavy shit too Oh almost too much we okay well that can't be well on my podcast she said uh her skin was bad because she was taken in her burn table said I think you're taking in too much testosterone too many loads yeah Jesus Christ or on your hands Brendan are you jesting you imagine have you taken so many loads that it changes your biological profile can you imagine for just Dana girls check out my fucking face keeps breaking out what's happening these fucking guys busting all over my face man she's in her urine Jess so much cum in her body probably anally a lot of it yes and go really horribly I don't matter it doesn't make that noise when I'm coming unless I'm farting dude yeah I've never had that choice go something hot about that there's some hot about that though I I would agree with you with AUSA hi great I like a turbo slut and say yeah but with will doom they're both like contact us I'd have her print up that shirt I'm Emily I'm gonna side with glitter I'll make your shirt also look very similar to - tag - why don't we make them oh we're terms but yeah the market gonna have to know it's not not at this show I thought I met a woman at one of my shows in Brooklyn she had no hands or her feet what happened to her well she came up to me after the show and she like wanted to like give me a hug she's like you're so funny and she had like these stubs and she said you remind me of the girls who did my nails when I had hands and I was like whoa shit so much today it was like racism mixed Korean Vietnamese what the fuck ho I was like I was thinking like I wouldn't bring it up if I just met her any other way right but since she brought up her hands I was like what happened to your hands and she said that she had something wrong with her appendix went to the hospital and the doctor put the wrong name like mixed up her charts and they amputated her hands and her feet I when she was only supposed to get her appendix taken out or something very minor what yeah like I did my friend sam cedars uh podcast a couple weeks back and and he said i don't want to give away with the movies I said listen man it's not that kind of movie and it hinges largely on the fact that I survived rapes as a child well like I heard from several people that you know you really should have had a trigger warning on there and it's like what the fuck do you think I was doing what the fuck do you think I was doing when I said it hinges largely I was warning you that what it was about right there but someone has empowered you to have a way to take issue with me because I'm not completely basing I'd like you know the whole world isn't based on me even though I got rape when I was four years old everybody shouldn't be thinking in terms of that all time because they've been through their own shit and they're dealing with their own shit and they're trying to survive so if I can make them more sensitive this issue if I can show them that it matters to them that they deal with other people have been through this kind of trauma and we want to reduce it as much as absolutely possible that's good but after that if I'm going to find a way to set up a situation where I'm always the injured party and that prove again and again that I'm persecuted and no one's thinking in terms of me then I'm never going to get fucking healed I'm never going to get fucking healed so what I did was I went out and I try to help other people when I help other people I realize how far along I've come and I realized there's really something in it for me to do that it's not like I'm this altruistic guy it's like I'm saving my own life like that AOL investigation that took such courage to do it know what would have taken courage was turning my back on those kids and walking away oh I don't want to know what's going on in there how would I live with that guy how would I live with myself then but they you know like I is nice everyone said oh gee that what he went through when he was doing that investigation what about the kids in the fucking pictures that's what I want everyone to know about thanks for caring about me but it's the kids in the pictures I give a shit about it's the kids that are suffering right now somewhere within the sound of my voice someone you know I mean in this broadcast like where this is on someone in the next apartment or wherever some kid it's going through this shit have the courage to know about it that's all I ask you have the courage to know about it and save the contemporary children so you don't have to deal with a bunch of fucking maniac abuse survivors with God that's all and if anybody can defuse the turnaround scape guys coming in now Donna everybody agrees I don't know anybody who doesn't think that these shootings are the police shootings are horrific but to interrupt a guy who is easily the most liberal that's what I'm saying out of all the candidates for president a guy who is the most diverse a guy who March when Martin Luther fucking King yeah he marched in the civil rights movement he's been a civil rights advocate since the 1960s and they interrupt his presidential speeches you don't have a theory that a lot of these a lot of these folks you know are the Che Guevera wearing t-shirt wearing guys right they want to feel part of a greater cause yes so even though many of those have passed them by they've been one I mean - civil rights I mean of course there's still racism but in terms of institutionalized and Democrat ISM we certainly are much better than we were fifty years ago but yet you know they're young kids they're Revolutionary they're wearing Che Guevara you know viva la revolución and they have to engage in this kind of behavior thirty years from now they'll watch that YouTube clip and they'll think they're a bunch of buffoons well I think anytime you could spend resources on something that's going to directly affect the youth of society and sending them a message about what is right and what is wrong hmm you know having grown up in a sporting household myself three daughters which you know played sports growing up and I look at kind of what I went through and what my daughter's have gone through in the life's lessons that you learn in sports that transcend sports and learn how to work under pressure how to work you know as a team how to individually succeed there's so many great lessons to be learned the health aspects of you know being healthy and working out all of a sudden you introduce into that equation number one breaking the breaking the rules and so there's you know the ethics to look at surrounding it and number two you know ultimately there can be risk and health consequences with using these things especially if you're young doing that so you know again going back to the message I think that it's sent to our kids and two parents with where I think society was going back then with the pervasive use of drugs and sports I think was a positive one is going to benefit people positively and I think it did it did have an impact how much does that guy weigh about allsey rather I'll find his stats but yeah I find his dad's if but if it depends it could be like five seven and he'd still be 230 pounds built like that he's a fucking giant he's beautiful you like it six feet tall 220 just an ape filled with fucking testosterone and fury god damn that's an athlete that's about as strong an athlete as you get human beings they're like you know it would have made a great slave auctioneer back and this is just a stat that that I liked it some that grips my heart so that's why I want to say it now but I'm man I think I looked it up right before I got in in here and it was around 11,000 people that Ebola took took out 11,000 people that's a ton it's a ton it's a brutal crisis but I just remember the uproar that that in the fear like the outcry that happened publicly all over the United States and only a couple people got it here now and then and still that's terrible but whenever I compare that 11,000 people total in this a bola crisis and then the stat for children and this is on water fors website and stuff and on ours and dude it's what I want to fight and let people know because there should be a real public outcry and uproar that 5,000 kids 5,000 kids under the age of five years old die every single day every single day because of dirty water because of waterborne disease because a waterborne illness that's a legit stat for like UNICEF or one of those like legit places 5,000 5,000 a day it's like it fluctuates from like four thousand seven hundred or something to five thousand a day and like for me man I've held two of those children you know I've I've dug the grave I've had blisters on my hands I've had a little dude named Andy buh is blood on my hands and like like bro it it's it wrecks me and like that's why I'm so passionate about this thing and like I come back in like I get it a bull is terrible and we need to knock it out because it can take out so many people but why why are people not like why don't they have their eyes open their ears open their heart open to hearing about 5,000 kids dying every day up in to the funeral of five other kids I've seen the grave of nine or ten others besides that like and these are just among the pygmies I've been to the I've seen the funerals going on of their oppressors like the the slave masters in the muck Paulo the non pygmies that surround them their kids are dying too dirty water and it's not I don't I don't mean to go crazy but no it's not crazy at all it's an that statistic is crazy most adorable nicest people in the world but you look at that you said bro do you not like the word world he'll like world is that hey say world how do you say it wo rld Debbie wider put the R before the O it rolls off the tongue easier then go in world world world world world how do you say it world no no you don't say it like that I say world how do you say it world no that's the right way that's why I say no you say bro love how does he say it Jamie you say Debbie rlz T is that I can't be it's the best thing in the world world world okay keep saying it like that we're good no that's what I say no you don't you say world like world world no you doesn't even say world world this is world WR o LD that's a nice a world world best thing in the world rod won't doesn't matter if you are do nothing bitch all you do is spend somebody else's money and try to look pretty like that's all you do is you use stuff up you use up resources and you give nothing and so you're pretty much a drain on society that's what I think they they don't think it that way they think what they are is something that all these men want to fuck well so in in working really hard to attain this this appearance all these men want to fuck that uh what they are they've created capital they've created like a need for this I was just brought up to think that it wasn't your mission in life to be happy it was your mission in life to leave the world better than how you found it and by being a cum bucket you're not gonna do that so I go to Chicago and it's Italian I'm not going to use any of real names because if people are still around so we're doing this thing it's at a golf course and they say to me listen there's a priest here okay so keep your act you know

on the sport yeah here in Ronda really pisses me off a valet detail veneers in the fucking president I wanted to rape him so bad of course I wanna kill my own back you know a car you can blow me like a cup of hot soup you son of a bitch below me like a cup of hot soup how's that work you blow on a cup of hot soup is that what it is yeah okay I don't but if he just blows you like that that's why it's confusing the vernacular is really odd like blowjobs I don't understand whether oh very can blow me like a cup of hot soup first time first time there you go yeah I've never heard that one fucking around that's the destination of the species the way that men and women interact with each other is becoming poisoned by these people you grotesquely underestimate their influence if you write them off as a few mad crazies in Student Union's they are also made the rate law but they have gigantic purchase on on the media and therefore on politicians well they certainly do when it comes to schools look at the school using the legitimate issue for even for women getting getting a sexually assaulted on campus listen though your president is parroting these myths from the DC area yes Obama has repeated the sexual harassment myth Obama has also repeated the wage gap myth you're dismissing these people are sort of powerless fringe crazies the President of the United States is repeating their talking points don't tell me these people are influential it's nuts well that's a different thing isn't it I mean when the president the president is really just a guy who's supposed to parrot what everybody else sort of already believes anyway and if that's what the progressive Democratic person you think a Republican president would be any different there'll be a lot more Jesus talk what else would be there from would tell the truth Trump would tell the truth I really like Trump or is it a troll no I accusing me of trolling what a horrible allegation I don't I don't know how we got from bethe comedian skull-fucking passed out girls to this but I'm trying man and men are different uh that's the big picture and feminism is something that's created by men as a false narrative yeah women have bought it hook line and sinker where they really should be at home protecting those very very valuable three years from 26 to 29 before their ovaries turn to sand it's um it's funny that you're being sarcastic because I'm listening you're going yes well done just keep on their feeling is understanding go on and deeply yet letting go deeply and letting go deeply in letting go 10 times more deeply in letting go deeply in letting go I'm gonna time it letting go deeply in let it go give it fully take him in letting go take a man let him go take a man letting go no hesitation I do this with Overeem as well and he feels wonderful yeah I'm everywhere like this says son I mean something else word like people are like that not people one guy I remember one guy like shit on the fucking ground and was like breakdancing in it like trying to like I mean it sounds like I make it up I swear I'm not dude he was his goal but to like spirit around it's been spreading out as much as he could and this is in the room with you no no that was in the hallway I was in the hallway as another dude its breakdancing on its own sheet yeah I mean it looked like his breakdancing but he was like he took a shit he's trying to smear it around as much as he could so it just looked like you expect answer I mean they had me in that and and because I was some guys are telling a story it's hilarious and he's like she came up to me and started mad dogging me and I was like what the fuck you looking at I paid for all that shit and you didn't say none of that you just said I was like that I had that look on my bread but I didn't say shit and if you don't question did you actually say that you're like no I was lying thinking I wouldn't ask you you would have made it seem like you this bad motherfucker in this story saying the reason how do you say shit and I was like fuck you have that shit you said that no no I thought it like I thought it fuck you and all and where you came from bitch did you actually say to him no what happened particularly in the Academy and I was teaching philosophy in the 1980s and the chairmen of my department asked me to teach a course in feminist theory and I thought fine I'm a theorist I'm a feminism I sent away for the textbooks I was shocked by what came through the mail I spent the summer reading these books and as a philosophy professor of many years I thought there was a sacred commandment about college teaching thou shalt teach both side to me it was my job as the teacher to take my views about the world and in and implanted them in the minds of my students I wanted to give them the techniques to make their own decisions and you do that one way to do that is to give them the best that was thought and said on both sides of a contentious issue well these textbooks were not like that they were a series of mutually reinforcing readings and it was a conspiracy theory about the patriarchy as buttressed by inflated statistics so I after spending a summer reading this books I wrote a paper and and gave I went to the American Philosophical Association and presented it and I will tell you typically at the American Philosophical Association if you give a paper people are it's very combative but then you go out for drinks well we did not go out for drinks I gave this paper women mostly women in the audience were hissing and booing and I was excommunicated from a religion I didn't even know existed a church of feminism I was I was a considered a that I'd committed an act of heresy what Graham and I are talking about actually presents a possible solution to what could have brought this planet out of the Ice Age something on a grand cosmic scale and the other point I think I'd like to make is that we have to really to understand our planet as a system we have to realize that it's part of a cosmic ecosystem and the cosmos has been a much bigger player in what's been going on down here than has been a previously understood or appreciated and I think our ancestors probably did under they did understand it they focus on back then there was all that what were you wearing what did you think was going to happen I mean it was really uh it was yeah dude it was I mean all of that that frat boys shed all of that reputation was earned you know just some of this dude I I've talked to guys like 10 years older than me and they tell me like half the shit that they you know not have to ship a sizeable chunk of some of their stories with the hazing and shit they did with chicks and be like dude you guys would all be in fucking jail for a long time yeah yeah like the 70s those guys that came of age in the 70s yeah I remember how god I'm not coming I got name name that no one huh night I'm riding in the car it was me and another comic and this other comic who was older and we would drive in killing time we started telling pussy stories dude and this guy's stories every fucking other story mean the other comical look at each other like doing what the fuck I'm one of his stories ended with yeah there were a lot of knows that night it just like dude what up we literally changed the subject Jesus Christ yeah and he was sitting there laughing because like to him it there wasn't that was what was done so you know uh I I don't any anybody that says from back then that that was done to them after just listening to that guy talking about the 70s on my Jesus Christ the 60s were like so I believe you know all of them dude it's very strange like girls are joining and they're getting killed you know the one one of the girls recently got beaten to death and one got murdered it's like what is going on I thought those closeted homosexuals at first I thought all their turrets were what I thought they're all just closeted homosexual can I come after you Bert Kreischer don't sink am I worrying about calm you worry about calming essential but you're not worried about saying that that's right that's hilarious now you've been drawing Mohammed the whole time that's hilarious you don't hear a lot of like like like homosexuality so kept down there like maybe they're just guys that are fucking no I don't think that's what it is sit in a cave like hey Ron I'll blow you and the guys like what I'll blow up let's go blow each other oh no I had Jeff Novitzky on the guy who busted him mm-hmm and um after he was on uh Lance contacted me and I had a conversation with him on the phone and Lance Armstrong contact yeah he may or may not do the podcast he wants to tell his story by and large people can have the perspective that you have they can say well looks to me like everybody did it so okay then they can look to the line and they that's where they really start to not like it they say this guy lied to us repeatedly but of course you get you know my there's no defense to that but if I could if I could share any personal insight I mean once you lie once you just keep lying you keep lying as if I'm gonna sit here you know this is 15 years ago and Joe you're a nice guy yeah I mean if I was on this podcast I would have lied to your fucking face a million times just so you know I would have just show you now just so you know but that's not a surprise to you ran buddy else but but once you're in there it's as if I'm gonna go you know this this guy Joe seems like a really nice guy I think I'm gonna be real I'm gonna be honest with him too much money there's no way you can't was that yes so I was I was stuck for lack of a better word in that and that distant that lie or that deception but then the way that I took my competitive nature which served me well in training and in racing and took it into the real world took it into a press conference took it into a personal relationship took it into former teammates my relationship that would that's the part where people go okay fuck this guy forever right I'm done and so that you know you got sort of three phases none of them are good but as it got further away that you know lack of respect for others is the thing that totally fucked me and you know to that I would I would say to anybody that I understand and and I may be in their timeout forever I have the only thing I will add that may sound like I'm trying to defend myself is I've I've tried to make amends with all those people
