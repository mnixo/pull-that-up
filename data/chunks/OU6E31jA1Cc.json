- one yeehaw hello Anthony Jeselnik how are you sir great Joe hey buddy are you fully committed to the beard now yeah I want to keep it as long as I can are you a mountain man oh you know as trim if Jim a little I trim it a little bit I just like the lady who cuts my hair trims it every look for weeks when I go in for a haircut but I don't touch it at all I'm afraid if I tried to trim it I would just ruin it no but I love love having a beard why do you love having a beard it is like it's like sunglasses for the bottom half of your face oh you know what I mean hide from the world kind of yeah I'd like make it chills me out a little more mmm yeah especially on stage like when I'm under the lights you know and I'm my lip would study a little bit sweating and I'm thinking about my lip and I'm like should I wipe this should I move it then I start to sweat more but now that I have the beard and mustache my lip gets a little sweaty you can't tell so I don't get more anxious mmm interesting yeah so you used to like think boy there's a little couple of beads upper lip yeah and I'm like can they see it why is it like that too much if I'm wiping like I drives me crazy you know it gets me boogers if I think I have a booger lips like what is going on with my nose what is that is that a booger shit can they see that oh I check for sure before I go in but I'm so animated and I'm always yelling and screaming I'm always worried that something is like hanging off the tip of my nose yeah I'm the people in the front row can't even enjoy like what the fuck man your nose bro I've never had that I've had like definitely a fly down situation oh yeah never never like a booger that ruined the show there's are two things that people love to laugh at your fly down and if you put a beer down on stage and the foam comes over the top Google your beers coming yeah those are those things mm-hmm high humor yeah high humor sweat like like weird sweat stains like when I've done special speaking which Anthony Jeselnik new comedy special comes out tonight I hear yep this evening midnight I guess Netflix does it yeah ha yeah I did very excite while I've been seeing your set it's fucking fantastic thank you.thank I think this is the best I've ever done so I'm I'm pump four it's a beautiful thing about comedy man keep working keep paying attention to it you get better at it you know really I mean Dom I ran and I had this conversation just a couple of months ago he like jojo's I've never been better he goes I'm fucking it a thousand years old there's never been better at comedy yeah as long as you don't quit yeah I know you don't you don't ever get worse I don't think right you don't as long as you don't give up because some guys don't quit but they give up exactly yeah they just go through the same material every single time you know what are you doing here you're just like you just try and get out of the house you're not trying to get better a little of that yeah yeah it's like if you're not right it does I guess that's the difference between also guys who put out specials or I say women too oh and people who don't some people just don't put anything out yeah yeah once you put it out like I put it out because I'm like I'm done with this now it's getting boring it's not gonna get better it's good as I can make it but because of that then I have to come up with a new hour you have any specific schedule you like to follow - right if I'm correct I try I did I did a year in LA like at the store every night you know and like once a month I do largo and try it all out at once and then at the end of that year I about forty minutes went the clubs for a year every weekend for a year and then once that I had the hour after that then I did a year of theatres I mean at the end of that year I taped the special and I was done with it so you're on like a three year plan pretty much yeah and that might change you know as I've gotten older the idea of a four year plan sounds a little bit nicer and you've other things going on that that it's not as I'm not as worried yeah yeah yeah I was trying I think two years seems to be right for me but it might be better to give it a little more time right just a little more time to tighten things up and polish and you know add layers and extra punch it's like you know those guys like and when I started out in Boston there was guys that had been doing on the same set forever and there's pros and cons to that and the pro is goddamn they had that shit down tight where it was just punchline rapid punchline pause punchline they knew the the economy of words was perfect there was no no fat in the bits they had they had tightened all that stuff up yeah my one of my biggest fears is like taping the special and then coming up with like a great tag yeah I mean like that I want it to be done when I shoot it because that feeling is awful yeah it's the worst I've done that yeah so by sucks it sucks I once went back in my last special thoughts and prayers I ADR the line I like walked offstage and was like oh fuck I should use this word and I just occurred to me in the moment that I was using the wrong word so I went back and ADR didn't you can obviously tell it's like maybe talking and then it's like clearly a different like a different voice just one word but I had ADR stand for I know what it means but what does it stand for Jamie knows he's an actual audio guy automated dialogue replacement why it's automated is lost in my head forever but that's what it means Wow okay I wouldn't have guessed that in a million years I would have never I knew what it meant I've done ADR yeah I did it like Fear Factor like every episode I had it do ADR it was the worst why did you because you were just mispronouncing names or you were it was usually because they wanted to tighten segments up like you know we would film for three days and we'd have to slam that down to 44 minutes and so sometimes you needed brevity or sometimes they needed clarification for certain things like like we would explain the rules to them like very specifically and they would have to read these rules and it took a long time but then like sometimes in the moment like on television you wouldn't explain it as clearly like while we're filming like we would we'd show them like this is what you have to do this is what you have to start here you go from here to there but sometimes when you would want to put it on TV you want to be more precise or more concise yeah so I would every fucking week I'd do ADR I hated it you did it seems like it would be fun like actor Fear Factor but just ADR seems like easy it's relaxed you're just in the booth yeah I was boring no I didn't like it ya know the fun thing about Fear Factor was when the checks came that was a fun thing and then when nice people won that was fun too yeah those those things were fun but really that was that was a great job but it was a job it was like a job but like you know if you had a great like yeah I really like working here whereas you don't really say that about stand-up no no don't think about it as a job it's just fucking fun it's awesome oh absolutely absolutely it's a get to do yeah I get to do yeah that's my new thing is I get to do versus have to do how long you been doing it now almost 17 years Wow yeah not crazy to say it did this it blows me away like 17 years just seems like seems like forever and I had had it my head like 20 was an important number like when you get to 20 that means something and I've I think I must have made that up like people say 10 years is a big deal yeah but 20 doesn't seem to like I thought that was like that's when you're really relaxed 10 years seems like you're a pro when I see someone I'm like Alan you'd be doing it 11 years all right I buy it and when someone says six years on my good luck mm-hmm you might quit yeah I hate the people who are like I've been doing it for like 12 years ones last time you got on stage six months ago oh I know you started doing stand-up twelve years ago yeah you've not been doing it yeah you go fuck yourself yeah yeah if you're not if you take those people that take like giant chunks of time off and then come back mm-hm you know want to go on the road with you like hey man yeah second that you know that's not how this works you gotta be you got to be putting in the work yourself otherwise what why and why am i doing you a favor yeah well it's just it's one of those things like if you wanted to run a marathon you have to run all the time mm-hmm or you're gonna be really hole-saw really sore and tired when it's over you know you're not gonna really be able to do it you want to be able to actually do it and really run mm-hmm this is same would stand up for whatever reason it seems so fucking easy when you're watching well yeah when you're watching someone do it it seemed this is one of the reasons why everyone thinks they can do it because it's just we're just talking what it's not like we're doing Cirque de Soleil up there mm-hmm and some people like oh that's not that funny I could be not that funny it's not that fun that big a deal yeah you could yeah maybe uh-huh yeah when you started out word you would say did you start in here Los Angeles did you really yeah what was your first club I my first ever show was at the belly room in the Comedy Store yeah I took a class Greg Dean I was working at Borders Books and Music was my first job in LA remember that play like that yeah big bookstore and I just found the thinnest book on stand-up comedy that they had and bought that and read it at the end it was like this guy teaches a class in Santa Monica so you went and people are like I surprised that I took a class it's like the class didn't teach me how to be like this it just kind of gave me the courage to go to open mics and and and I don't think I could have gone to an open mic I was too scared for that I was like 23 but after the class you know I had a seven-minute set that I would go and go and do what did the class teach you like how they how do they start a class huh if like there were two sessions it was like it was like beginning and advanced and they would talk a little bit about joke structure they would talk about like simple things like taking the mic out of the stand you know like but be careful cuz some people walk up and they take the teeth out you know what I mean like things like don't run the light show up early like things that were just may not have been common sense but it like it gave me comfort to know the rules so that I could try to break them you know later on and then did a set at the belly room like with a bunch of other like people in the class who were all terrible none of them are doing stand-up anymore and I like killed like I thought I killed I had the tape I send it out to everyone and one of the jokes from that first set I ended up using in the Donald Trump roast reels I was like oh wow maybe there's like some gold in there and I went back you know ten years after I did it and watch the set again and had a panic attack watching myself by the way it wasn't my head it was not what was on was not what was on screen it was bad do you think that's like just like psychological protectants that you throw up I mean what is it that makes you think that you were better back in the day I think it's exciting it's excitement right I know and just being stupid you know like when people get into Stan later on in life I'm like I don't know if you can do this because you have to kind of be dumb enough to go through the things you have to do when I start out but I'm glad I was 23 when I was running around to open mics and not knowing any better that's a really good point yeah yeah I was 21 I was really dumb yeah did you just went right to an open mic or yeah well I went to an open mic to watch first and that's what gave me the courage to go onstage because I had always thought like stand-up comedy was going to be Jerry Seinfeld or Richard Pryor and if you go there like you know and I had wrote a bunch of stuff and I practiced a bunch of stuff into a tape recorder and it was terrible but you know it's trying to say it like a comedian but then when I went to an open mic and I realized how bad some of those people are I was like well I can be that bad I can do that I know I could pull off what they're doing yeah there's something about like performing for comedians that really angered me like if an audience wasn't laughing I was like all right whatever the comedian's it's like no you guys should get me really ticked me off that I didn't have any friends in the open-mike community that would laugh no I didn't have friends at all like I would I was just the guy who showed up and and did a set and we just get angrier and angrier so I would like because I was mad at they didn't they didn't get that I was funny you know it was like it's my job to prove it to them I think these people should understand that I'm that I'm funny that something about if a comedian that doesn't like me or doesn't like respect what I do I'm just like I can't believe you're comedian like I really feel that way well that's a funny way of looking at it well it's one of those things where you want to be good so bad you'll sort of convince yourself that you're good or you convince yourself that you're better than you are like I remember the feeling of being at an open mic night and not being sure whether or not I was going to go onstage or not having a spot and watching these guys go goddamnit I want to go up there if I got up in front of that crowd right now I could kill mm-hmm you just convinced yourself that you were good yeah I mean I knew that my performance was bad I knew I was like funnier than what I was putting out there and that was what frustrated me and say I've got to keep writing new joke to get to to be able to prove myself you get to your potential exactly yeah yeah that's a it's a it's an interesting thing because it occurs in almost everything that's difficult to do is like you see the path you're like okay just keep good like martial arts for example it's perfect perfect examples like you'll practice with a white belt and you kind of think look I kind of get this I'm gonna get good at this how many people and then you'll practice with someone who's really good who does it every day and there's a black belt and you just feel helpless and you feel like goddamn and I'll never get to that spot mm-hmm and that I used to feel like that about standing up there was a guy when I first started out he probably never heard of him but he's one of the best comics of all time his name is Teddy Bergeron and he was a Boston legend he had a problem with substances to put it mildly and he what his timing was impeccable he went on The Tonight Show like back in the day and he would play piano as well and he had like like the ultimate set on The Tonight Show I mean just fucking murdered sat on the couch with Johnny I mean and just was killing it and just super Lou and then went off the rails like the pressure of success and everything and pills and booze and whoo yeah the whole thing but when I was an open mic or one of the early early sets that I did I remember I did a set and then he went on you know there was a bunch of open mic errs and then some professionals would hop on and do like 5 10 minutes and he went out but did that and he was so fucking good and so polished I almost quit that's like I was like what am i doing I'm terrible I don't have a point of view I don't I don't have perspective I don't have that kind of timing I definitely don't have that kind of swagger like he had a like a casual swagger you know on stage did you have like an idol like somebody were trying to be as a stand-up um like in the beginners are probably a bunch of guys I sounded a lot like Richard Jeni in the beginning I was kind of stealing like almost stealing his timing then I realized at one time one time I was on stage and I heard myself sound like a man I was like all right I gotta fix this yeah you know I did that with it with Dave Attell in New York I did it I would run downstairs and watch @l set and then one day I caught myself not doing one of his bits but like one of his mannerism kind of things yeah it's just fun to do and I felt I was like I got to stop this and I went and told SD at the woman of books the Comedy Cellar I was like I got to stop watching Dave Attell and I said it like I confessional and I thought she was gonna be like you're not real comic then everyone watches to tell and she goes good like more people should stop watching Dave Attell like people are just ripping him off and I understand why but he's got such a bizarre sense of timing and it's so infectious yeah oh yeah just so it was so fun he's on him to watch I've known Dave for like 28 years I think and he's always been like that he always had that very strange way of talking yeah you know oh it's a box I've known him maybe 10 years and I don't know him at all you know I mean we've like talked a couple of times but I don't know anything about the guy yeah and I think I met him after he had quit drinking so he was a different oh yeah oh yeah I knew him in the heart when he was on that show insomniacs and he was getting blasted out of his gourd every night every night he was going these places and it was killing them yeah and he stopped doing the show for that very reason cuz everywhere he would go it'd just be shots shots shots and and then he one time ran into at the improv and it was like 1 o'clock in the morning and I was headed home and he's like hey is there a after party where do we go I was like where do we go like go home go to sleep yeah and then the next time I saw him he was totally sober he's one of those guys though that got sober and didn't stop being hilarious no a lot of guys do yeah oh yeah sober up and then they become annoying mm-hmm and then they want to talk about their sobriety but I cannot stand I can't stand recovering addicts but not they drugged them yeah man they're worse than people who just find yoga mm-hmm they just won't shut the fuck up about recovery yeah I'm guilty of that with many things I know if I get into something I can't shut the fuck up about it but I get it you know for them it's like this typical moment in their life we're all sudden they have their shit together and they just want to talk about all the time the thing that drives me nuts though is when they judge yes if they always get a little judgy that I go you sure like do you need that last drink and I'm like yeah I do and I can handle my shit so hey I'm super sorry you got that fucked up Jean yeah yeah whatever so you went too far with it but I I've got it under control I like being a little buzzed like it mm-hmm and I'm luckily the drugs in the in the drinking that I do it's uh you know I if I'm gonna drink I drink high quality stuff smoke a little weed but the other drugs don't really do it for me have you fucked with the other drugs tried just about everything yeah and it's just like not from me like I've done cocaine and the next day been like I just feel stupid like I feel like everything that came out of my mouth last night was dumb I feel like hell I enjoy weed chose me out like beer and wine and and in vodka and whiskey I have not done a lot of things I've never done masculine or peyote just basically I think they're pretty much the same thing I've never done coke I've never done meth I've never done any real and feta means I've always been scared of those though because those the ones that I've seen people like really lose their lives for yes yeah I don't mess with them feta means at all and I don't enjoy it someone who grinds their teeth you know like that that's that's awful and I found like with it's a comedy you can't be funny on cocaine at comics who do do cocaine and our flame yeah because I just find it to be like you're not I can't laugh at anything and I can't like I'm talking too fast my timings off and like I'm not thinking in a funny way but I've always been surprised the comics who have coke problem yeah Joey Diaz talked about that cuz Joey Diaz did coke for years but he doesn't he's never done coke and I said she goes he goes every time I tried it I was fucking terrible he goes it takes away your soul ya heart you got no heart when you up there yeah you know they I guess again I've never done it but uh but I didn't get is just I get that whole speedy thing were you just like your sense of how people are perceiving you is distorted timing is distorted yeah like I don't even go onstage hi I may have a couple beers I'd only be slurring in smoke pot at all that day it's a worse show for it really yeah wonder why that is I think I'm just in my own head you know I make it makes me want to get through the set as opposed to being present and enjoying it like I just wanted to be over so I can go chill out hmm you know it's only on only with weed one of my favorite things to do when I would take guys on the road means get him so high that they could barely talk and then put them on stage that's the first the first two guys I would open for on the road it was Doug Benson and Brian Posehn Jesus Christ and they were like they wanted to smoke all day but I was like every time I was a feature act like most every time I was a feature act I was terrible because I thought like I have to smoke these guys they won't take me on the road but I'm like barely getting through this half hour yeah and I'm terrible it's not a smart move for someone who's just getting going to be that high on stage but one time I did I was uh I I really didn't smoke pot I was 30 like really smoked pot but I did it a handful of times when I was younger and one time when I was like 21 I was living with my buddy Jimmy and him and one of his friends came over and he had pot we smoked some pot during the day I think we had a barbecue or something and then I had a gig like six hours later I was still high and I remember being on stage and and my timing was excellent and I was so locked in and focused and I remember being terrified that I was gonna be terrible terrified but I really nailed it for whatever reason but then I never did it again and I was like boy I got away with it you know and then I started smoking when I was thirty and it kind of changed my act like it made my act from like it made my act more introspective I started talking about weirder subjects and more interesting I started talking about things that I was actually more interested in did you start to write on stage more when you were high on stage yeah I have always have written on stage a little bit but mostly mostly like tangents like I'd go off on a weird branch if I knew how to get back to the river right Oh take like a weird stream off to the right and then just long as I knew how to get back to the river of whatever the fuck I was talking about I'd be fine but when I'm high I'll just let go wandering through the woods like I'm not even concerned about the river oh my god you know there's the river of thought the pattern that you're following but when I'm high I'm like what but who the fuck wants that and the why why would you be that person and then I'm thinking like I remember when I was a kid and then I'll just like out of nowhere have this idea and I'm hoping it's gonna go somewhere and those moments I feel like they're like it's like foraging for food like occasionally you find it like if you go out looking for mushrooms you don't know where they are you might find edible mushrooms hopefully you're gonna find them again sometimes you won't sometimes you come home in an empty basket but sometimes you get them and the only way you find out is if you forage and that's kind of what it feels like when I'm high on stage it's like okay but then I'm also really worried that I'm gonna be boring like I want to be I know these people paid to see I know I'm trying to develop material but I also know I'm entertaining these people in the present so it's like a fine line yeah I don't have that confidence to waste the audience this time I'll see Chris Rock yeah a friend of mine and he'll go up and just like with nothing yeah and just sit there and look very comfortably for 45 minutes and just and just and just kind of talk and look for things and has no problem with whatsoever now this is what else he'll go what else what else no like stare at the sky look at the ground I can't you know was the master at that was Damon Wayans oh my god ooh a lot of people have forgot a lot of people forgot was one of the fucking still is one of the best comics ever Damon was a goddamn murderer in the 90s oh I love firming up but I remember going to the haha cafe they would do it like a show every Tuesday that my friends would run and Damon Wayans would always drop in and do an hour and ruin the show he would have no material and he would just attack people in the crowd by the time he was offstage like the audience was furious like they were they went crazy when he came out and then by the end they were just like why is he doing this to us he'd be like we were like oh fuck Damon Wayans is here really looked up to as a kid and like loved you just like oh man this asshole again wow that's crazy I wonder why I was doing that I guess it's probably because he couldn't do it at the store anymore yeah what how many years ago was this god I mean at least at least 10 12 13 years ago yeah see that puts it that's that makes sense right because that's around 2005 yeah that's like probably he stopped going to the store the store probably tightened up the way they used because they used to just let anybody just drop like Eddie Griffin would drop in wasn't on the wasn't on the schedule he would drop in at 9:00 p.m. and get offstage at 3:00 a.m. and that was real yeah yeah that was real six hours and and then when he was done he was like who's next who's next six hours what's the longest that you've ever done I think an hour and 40 minutes maybe a little longer I don't remember but I think an hour and 40 minutes probably the longest I've ever done yeah yeah but that's too long too long yeah an hour and 20 is more than anybody should ever have to hear you talk yeah and even that it's like pushing it what I like I like I like to do when I do like a theater a to an hour or an hour and ten and I just well I just want to just start and then finish just come on go ready and then for one hour I want everything to be tight and concise and I would way rather have an hour and 10 minutes that people really enjoyed versus an hour and a half were there like an hour of it was really funny cuz then that leaves you with this even if it's the same hour that extra time I also just think the audience doesn't want to see more than an hour of comedy no and it's like like people work I did three hours the other night like wow like the audience must have hated it like Chappelle used to drop into the cellar he and like Dane Cook were going back and forth like who could do the longer set long ever world record right they had like World Records yeah and then I think Bob Marley eventually broke it or something marlee from maine yeah yeah I didn't he do like two days on stage and but Chappelle was down there one time and I was like oh I'm gonna check it out and it was like almost unwatchable yeah cuz it was like the pacing that they had that you have to do in order to be on stage that long and he was funny but he would be like not funny for long stretches than a big punch line yeah and then back into it you're like all right like I was when Dave was on hiatus right that was when Dave kind of like took time off a comedy for a long time he cut I mean kind of like he was doing specials but I think he was doing like surprise shows like he was always always kind of on tour in weird venues he's still doing that now he's not always doing like big big giant theaters so like he'll just want to book like a 20 seat room yeah and make his agents crazy well he's been doing it he's been doing the lab at the improv that little tiny room which is what 50 50 seats maybe yeah he did it Aziz did it that's a that's a place where comedy dies that little fucked up room I have always hated that room that room sucks every dick on the planet when people are like oh you can try it new stuff it's like I can try the new stuff in the main room yeah for a good crowd like why do I want to do this little terrible room I don't know why it's even there well it's a weird one was cuz the belly room is perfect the belly room works yeah but some works for some reason that lab seems like why is there comedy here what is why is the door right there why is this tree right there what is this yeah what is this here what you got going on here everything about it it's bad yeah like I I was trying to tell them I go turn that into the comics green room like no there's good comedy there I'm like shut your mouth you shut your mouth you turn that into the comic scream room yeah they used to be where the bar was right now they used to be like where everybody'd hang out before the show it was great it was great and he'd go in the other room to go onstage and you would go from that part to go on stage now everybody goes from the front door to go on stage so you're trapped in that little hallway like where the fuck how do I where do I hide yeah yeah there's nowhere to hide that's why I love the stores so much you know there's so many places to hide but the store has that little problem with the o.r like when you're right before you're about to go on stage you're in the hallway and yeah I don't like the hallway but I like those seats on against the back yeah just for comics do yeah and I sit there and go over your notes and yeah I love that back bar yeah Akbar is my favorite the back bar is the shit the the secret comedians bar yeah I mean that's just what they've done in the new this new generation of managers and the people that run the place now they've sort of like really paid attention to like what what's gonna make these guys happier what's gonna make this better like you gotta give them a place where they can hide so giving that back bar and you go to the back bar any day it's filled with people just hanging out talking shit and like it's fun it's like a fun play I go there I gravitate and I get into the back here I'm like oh look at all these cool people yeah that's a great spot to hang out it yeah yeah they did that they added security they did it so it's it's night and day to the way it used to be I never used to go there I didn't like hanging out there I didn't like any part of it and then once once the new management took over I was like oh great like I once did a show there I did a benefit there was a kid who died I forget his name he was a comic died in a car accident and they had like a benefit for his family oh yeah that's Josh Adam Irish friend Angelo yeah yeah I did not know him I didn't know him either but by seems like a fan of mine and I was like I was like his favorite comic that they could get and I'm like I'm on the marquee it's a sold-out show I have a great set I walk off and Tommy comes up and he's like the old manager is like ant that was great man we got you got to get you around you get you guys start hanging out you know you got to started hanging out and doing you know doing the open mic and stuff and I'm like to me open my name is on the marquee right now you just watched me headline this show like what are you talking about and I then that I don't never saw him again next thing I knew he was fired and they were like what can we do to get you back here well that's Adam you know right Adam get the same thing to me he told me that Tommy got fired and came to visit me The Improv so you were gone seven years seven years from the store yeah and then when Tommy left they brought you back in yeah well there's two reasons one I had to go physically to the store because Ari was filming his Comedy Central special and is like that he's a you know Ari's just one of my best friends and I knew him from the time he was a doorman and I knew that him filming his special affair was so important and there's no way I was gonna miss it I was like I have to be here like I have to see this at the store so I was like ah fuck all right I gotta go back and so I decided to go back I think he was filming on a Wednesday what what night is gross battles on Tuesday right so I went down there on a Tuesday so let me go down on Tuesday just to see what's up and I went to roast battle and I was like holy shit this place is electric this is crazy like the environment is so much different it's so creative and the the night that I was at roast battle was fucking fantastic it was so good there was so many funny Roasters and I remember thinking wow this place is just different man it just feels so much different and it wasn't like it is now like now like you'll go on a Saturday night they'll have six sold-out shows they have two shows in the belly room two in the are two in the main room everything sold out and packed with headliners and it's chaos it wasn't like that it was still sort of shitty like in terms of like the numbers but the vibe and the creativity was way different and the new guys and girls that were coming up they were fucking good man I was like wow this is a different vibe I'd been gone for almost a decade yeah so that brought me in and like I said I had to be there for Ari there was no way like there's no way I could miss it I had to be there so I'm like all right I just got swallowed and that was probably what Adam for sure helped but I might have stayed away forever if it wasn't for Ari I just had to see it you know do you like roast battle do you like judging that I get I cringe sometimes because they're so fucking me yes yeah sometimes people are so mean you know but I do like it I do love the writing aspect of it I love the fact that it's a joke writers form but I don't want to name any names or there's one comic than I'm friends with that does really well on roast battle and I said hey man how come you when you roast you have all this good new material but you're doing the same stupid shit when you go onstage all the time like you were doing the same set for years you're not you're not advancing because you're not writing a lot but you're writing a lot when you write for roasts mm-hmm I'm like you should treat like your material like the same way you treat your material when you have to roast like the thing about the roast is like say if you are gonna roast with Tony Hinchcliffe you guys know each other you know who you're writing for all right Tony what does he look like you looks like you know you start fucking around with all I know this about Tony and that about Tony this is gonna be funny and it forces you to be creative whereas I think there's so many guys that they they develop a framework of a set and then they just kind of like that that is their comfort the comfort is in the fact that they know even if it's not good they know that they can go from this to that and that to this and they know where they're going and they don't they're not lost you know and I think that the beautiful thing about the roast is none of that material you can do in any other place you can only do it right there so you have to work on them and so often times you see like what Comics capable of when they're roasting versus what they're doing when they're actually doing their real set which seems stale yeah yeah I feel like it's almost I agree with everything you're saying that it's almost like it's not beneficial right to be like a really good at roast battle and not as a Stan like it takes it can take away from stand-up and people think it's like this this path to glory and I'm not sure that it is no I don't think it is I think it's a good exercise if you're if you're treating all of your comedy the way you treat the roast battle like you're always working on it but I think there's a lot of guys who just aren't working on I think part of our problem is there's no other art form like stand-up where there's like you were telling me you were saying how you took a class to learn to get on stage but you were quick to add and almost every great comic does this that you really didn't learn anything in that class but no but it got you to the stage that's weird that there's nothing like the best education that we have is talking to each other like how do you write how do you do it and I'm always I've been doing how many 30 years and I'm always like how do you do it what are you doing what are you doing this way are you doing it that way what are you write it do you write it out like everybody's got a different thing like bird doesn't write anything out just his notes and works it out on stage you know he writes it he has these ideas in his head and then he rants and you know he uses his podcast to develop a lot of his material because his podcast is unique in that it's just him talking mm-hmm but everybody's got a different thing and there's no one who's right like now no one no one's right I let this was it Stanhope who said that if you tell if you give a comic advice you're just telling them how to be more like you mmm you know that I kind of agree with it you can say like write more get on stage as much as you can you know that's important but there are things even in comedy that like you hear early on the it takes 10 years to understand yeah you know like I remember the movie um the movie comedian with Jerry Seinfeld was like a huge influence on me and there's one point where just Seinfeld is kind of depressed and he's like conk wins like what's the matter he's like I just don't know when I'll be back you know when I'll feel like I'm back again with this new material and Colin Quinn says uh when you're on stage and you're killing and you're miserable that's when you'll know you're back like we just look great I'm making these idiots laugh inside I was dying laughing and I was like I was saw that and I didn't understand what he meant and now I know exactly what you know well if I could go back to when that was filming I would grab orny Adams and go don't do it don't let them do this to you man how long you been doing comedy don't let them do this they're gonna put you that they're doing this to make Jerry look better don't let him do it mm-hmm I mean he must have thought it was like the biggest thing in the world for him yeah and I'm so mad like I love that movie I watched the DVD once a year and there's no orny Adams commentary track they should give him one I think with no reference it like in the other comment the big Oni will talk about this in his and I think he was so angry with the way he was portrayed that he refused to do what I was given here they portrayed I mean they they just edited him the worst aspects of it they didn't want to give a nuanced perspective on who he is and what he's doing they just wanted him to be like the young guy who's trying to figure it out versus the old you know legend mm-hmm mm-hmm but they would like my friends would use him as an example like if I was like acting like a jerk they Beck you're behaving like going yet like you need to like I came in second and like a comedy competition and I was mad about it and they were like don't be like warning and I was like thank you got it well he's doing great now I mean or he's doing fine but I don't met him a couple of times he's in he's a knight he's always been nice to me nice guy I once did a show at the improv where's years ago and it's an 8 o'clock show I'm not I'm not the headliner the owners going on after me but it's like I'm the biggest name on the on the marquee and I get there and there's six people in the audience and two of them were like friends of mine would never see me perform and I was like this is humiliating I was like what I'm like yelling at the staff I mean how do you have six people here at 8:00 p.m. on a Friday I go to the store right now and it's the five rooms were sold out like what's going on and I get on stage and I'm so embarrassed my friends who see me that I'm yelling at the staff staff members are walking by time screaming at like yelling at the sound guy don't even I don't even do a joke I like put the mic down I'm like fuck this place I'm never coming back and I leave and I see my friends a couple days later and I'm like so sorry about that like no you were funny look at the guy who went after you that guy was angry sound guy for 15 minutes like what the hell did you do The Improv had those dark moments they still kind of do sometimes like sharp did a show there recently on a Friday night it was 25 people in the crowd I live I blew up at like the new booker that i called me up and like we would love to have you back as we see at the store what can we do to get you back at The Improv and I'm like email me once so once a week and tell me what spots you have and I'll tell you when I can go like all right like I'm booked for a Wednesday I see the lineup it's like me five people Tiffany Haddish I'm like great should be good show day of the Improv emails me and they're like listen Tiffany Haddish wants to do an hour and she wants you to introduce her so it's just gonna be the two of you guys no emcee and I'm did you just bump me down to opening act like without and not asking if this is okay just like you're now the emcee going up cold that I was and I'm like alright I'll be there but know that I'm furious and they're like why didn't you just cancel and I'm like because I want you to know how mad I am never coming back here and Tiffani was great that was nice to her but I was just I couldn't believe that they would treat me with like that I'm there tomorrow night at the improv I'm there all the time yeah you want to do a set maybe sold out actually I got I'm going to dinner to celebrate the special dam yeah it's good if you catch it with a packed crowd it's just they didn't have the right approach to marketing yeah that's all it is but he used to when I first started that was the club yeah you know well that was where I went when I left the store when I left the store for seven years I did my sets at The Improv at the ice house haha I did just anywhere else but the store Laugh Factory no no no never they film you yes yeah and they put people up and they put they've done it with me they put your shit up on line and they say they don't do it anymore but that's too late you can't just do that yeah and their attitude about it was very disappointing like when I told them that I wanted them to take my shit down they were not they then weren't they weren't understanding or apologetic until it became a big deal yeah like big deal like you know like how to get other people involved mm-hmm it was not good it's not the wise to think that you could just film people and put them online when they're working out for free yeah and I know yeah especially like a guy like you who's going to do a fucking Netflix special so you're gonna release this stuff and put it online long before Netflix gets a hold of it and the attitude about it just wasn't good I mean it's a great club I've worked there many many times I just don't do it anymore yeah you know it's just get it together you know this this is the fucking big leagues we're in Hollywood this is not like some fucking shithole comedy club in the middle of nowhere that nobody goes to this is on the Sunset Strip this is in Hollywood and you're doing that like what do you guys what are you doing yeah he couldn't trust him it just was ridiculous but it's a great club me go there you'll see great comedy it's it's a fucking killer setup you know it's there's a lot of the pieces are in place for it to be amazing yeah I was going back for a little bit but they would like they would use me to promote the whole show it's like you think as if it's just my show all right I'm just doing 15 minutes and making the same money as everybody else on the lineup like if I'm at the Comedy Store it's like me you D'Elia Sebastian like you don't feel that pressure right and we're all in it together kind of thing that it's seeing enjoy the store a lot more than it just with the way they promote yeah I feel less pressure yeah the quality of the comedy is better and at the store and this like there's something about that that I think is like one of the things that's happened from the 7 years ago or the 7 years when I was gone versus now which is I've been back like almost four years would be four years in November or five years November is that it's better for me to see guys like you and to see guys like Neal Brennan and and all these it's just working with killers just just this lineup of like where I know that if there's 400 people in that audience they're coming to see everybody they're not just coming to see me and I think that's that's critical for developing material I think it's critical for putting piecing stuff together and and putting an act together it's like I need a balanced audience I don't want to perform for the the converted you know exactly like if I feel like the store is like a gym yeah where you're working out we're like you're not getting the same I don't get the same laughs at the store that I do if I go to Largo and every single person there has paid 30 bucks just to see me so they're like it makes it easier but because I've worked at the store like you it's like I've earned that at Largo yeah you know but you but if I just did Largo all the time and that was it I wouldn't be as good you know you need to kind of you need to suffer a little bit there's so nice at Largo mm-hmm I did law I did Whitney show at Largo and it was it was so so nice and then uh I did this bit about mocking feminists and I could say like I don't like feminists for the same reason why I don't like white people or only in the white people like I like people who like everybody like I'm not interested in anybody who's really only into one thing you know like come on stop yeah it's nonsense you're like I do women need equal rights of a fucking course of course yeah but I want to hear you talk about it all the time it's annoying yeah and you can see like the the tightening up like someone saying that they don't like feminists like it's like oh you guys are indoctrinated I see what this is and so then I felt like and it helped me actually develop this one piece that I was doing and that the like sort of around it rounded out this one piece I was doing because I was trying to figure out a way that I could explain it to someone who might have a preconceived notion about Who I am like the to say it in a way that makes people that were hesitant laughs you know I mean versus savages at 11:30 on a Saturday night that are hammered mhm mm-hmm yeah so Whitney Cummings crowd wasn't endear anti-feminist they laughed they laughed because the punchline was good and I had a place to go with it and the place to go was ultimately mocking men's rights activists that was the the the real thing was the the this the set up for that joke is I don't like anybody's into one thing and I go but what drives me the most fucking crazy is men's rights activists I'm like every men's rights activist I ever met I just want to grab and go dude we got them all yeah we got all the rights yeah we got them all I can't believe that's a real thing what's a real thing if you get divorced and you have child it's for child custody those things are those things are real like guys really I know men who have gotten really fucked over in divorce where their wife hired a fucking killer lawyer and they dragged them through see the thing about and I learned this from Phil Hartman unfortunately before he died I was trying to tell him to get divorced and he I said just give her half man you'll make more money it's not half he goes it's 2/3 it was the fucking lawyers take a third it's a goddamn scam you know he like he was furious about it because apparently he had been trying to figure it out like how to do it but I had a friend whose wife ex-wife dragged it out on purpose because she wanted him to pay the legal bills so he had to pay for her lawyer he had to pay for his lawyer then he had to pay for all of the times that she decided to change the goalposts and Moo and renegotiate like there's no no one can say that you can't renegotiate so she would just renegotiate and just drag things out and her her goal was to try to drain him financially mm-hmm so she was doing this on purpose like targeting so he was essentially paying for the general of the army that was plotting the murder and he was slowly going crazy and I was watching my friend go crazy and it took several years for it to be completely resolved and he's still paying her he's still but he's been divorced for I think 12 years now and he still pays her she they didn't have a child and he has a family now he's married with children now he and he still pays this person still paid like he fucked her so hard she can't work 12 years later yeah it's so that's where men's rights activists have a point because if you're in a state that's particularly progressive or liberal in regards to alimony and child support the only love the only thing that we win on that is like Tom Arnold like we got a one on the board for Tom Arnold when he Devore but the problem with that is I love Roseanne more than I love Tom Arnold no offense Tom but I do you know so like it bothered me that Roseanne had to pay him like bro get the fuck out of here you can work like why how come we you with a successful person if that successful person says get fucking kick bricks get out of here you have to pay them DEP that person has to pay the person they're getting rid of yeah well oh he's used to her lifestyle what that's that that I'm used to it is yeah it's the only thing that makes sense is child care that makes sense and like hey who this person is taking care of the children they're your children you guys had these children together you have to contribute to the the money that it costs to raise a child 100% I get it what I don't get is alimony I just don't get it we're not together anymore know how we were before we were together and you didn't have any money and then you met me and now I have money and then you you got used to having money well you're gonna have to get used to not having money yeah because now you don't have any money because now we're not together anymore or like a year maybe you know what I mean like let her take some time to get back on her feet but be a prostitute or anything yeah you don't have to be a it's just bitterness it's like I want to take you for everything that I can like one of my friends was going through a divorce he was like all my friends have gotten a divorce 80% of them if they have kids the wife accuses the husband of molesting the kids just for visitation you know just to like for negotiation yes exactly well the lawyers are onto that now you know I mean this is actually something that my friend was warned of when their him and his wife were splitting up like is your wife malicious will she you know make some sort of a baseless accusation and he's like how so and then they went into that yeah man there's evil people out there that and there's also this thing that happens when people break up with someone if someone doesn't want to be with you anymore someone that you deeply loved and cared about you want them to suffer that's weird it's weird I mean it's normal so I guess it's not that weird but that the evil vicious jealousy you know you see that vicious jealousy and chimpanzees like one of the things that chimpanzees do when they attack people one of the things they attack people over his unfairness like there was a terrible story about a guy who had kept a pet chimp and then brought the chimp a birthday cake on his birthday Brian Posehn has a whole bet about it do you does it does yeah and the other chimps found out that this chimps getting a birthday cake and they saw it and they weren't getting any cake and they were fucking furious so someone had inadvertently left one of the gates open so the chimps got out tore this guy apart because of a birthday cake but it's that thing it's not like it was affecting them I was like he was doing something bad to them so they got out and killed him no they ripped his dick off because they didn't like the fact to give the other chimp a birthday cake so his dick took his fingers took his feet yeah yeah yeah Posehn spits so funny is like the the worst thing about that story for that guy is that everyone's gonna want to hear it forever because it starts with so I was bringing a birthday cake to a chimpanzee and like you got to get the rest that but that that anger and jealousy like there's evolution there's an evolutionary basis for it oh is that what he looks like now oh my god it's tough his fingers are missing his face is missing he's got one eye his nose is gone look at that frown Oh Wells face is ripped apart I probably stitched it together that way awful yeah it's fucking awful man yeah you can't own a chimp crazy assholes they're the most vicious of all the primates next to people I'll take good for like you can put like trained em like the first like five years of their life and then they forget everything they just decide they're gonna fuck you up yeah and they're so strong what does that one doing is that the chimp no no but it just popped up in the same group of pictures issues hairless chimp look so there's some mean such a it's such a mean species you know there's a problem with colobus monkeys in parts of Africa where chimps live because they've eaten so many colobus monkeys that they're the populations down 97% yeah they rip them apart and eat them a lot more than alive are they tiny cups monkeys it's not big not big enough to eat but uh is it David Attenborough documentary from the 90s where they first discovered that chimps eat monkeys they really didn't know they thought the chimps were basically herbivores and then they got this video footage of them hunting these monkeys and the way they would Corral them and beat them through the trees and catch them and this monkey screaming while this chimp is ripping it apart from the hips by just chewing it pulling it apart from the he's like and he's like basically ripping his legs and his ass end off I'm just eating it alive goddamn they're fucking mean and they're fucking mean it's a mean animal but the wood but I get the fact that look everything's mean in the jungle there's big cats and poisonous snakes and spiders and it's just a hard hard hard world but the thing that dries that gets me is the jealousy because I don't think other animals experience jealousy the way chimps do if this is that it right there from the attenborough the end of the clip where they actually caught it yeah so that's a monkey in his hand yeah dude the videos of it killing it while they're pulling it apart like wah but that jealousy that I want you to suffer I didn't get that fucking cake oh you don't let me have that cake I can't get any cake I'm gonna pull your fucking dick off on it bite your nose off like that that is a as a strange trait for an animal to have oh yeah no I mean I think it's a terrible trait for a human being to have oh yeah yeah yeah it's something you got to work on but when it comes to divorce like that's that same thing it's like that same I want you to fuck and suffer or I want to pull your dick off and that's why you know people hire hitman and shit to kill their ex-wives and killer ex-husbands well yeah people don't get less crazy as they age you know no time to get more because then they've realised it's almost over the rides over and now you know you know 65 year old lady no one's a fuck you and your 65 year old man don't want to fuck you either and now all sudden you guys are battling you know yeah battling over finances and this and that I can't be the best years of my life oh that's my favorite I did I did a girl want someone we broke up she said I wasted all this time with you I said oh like oh I thought we were dating yeah I didn't know you were investing yeah yeah yeah I wasted it oh you wasted it well I guess every relationship when it's over is a waste like what that's so bizarre yeah bizarre way of looking at it yeah enjoy the present enjoy the time you had together yeah but if you thinking about in terms of like hitching a ride on a successful train yeah if your goal is to get married and you're with someone for five years and then they break up the oh you know I should've been with someone else yeah you would have married me now I gotta find someone else yeah the jealousy thing about the breakup is so it's so normal it's so hard for people to not be jealous like no very few people ever break up and go hey man she's cool it just didn't work out I was a dick she was she needed some growing we need we both needed time away hey I wish her well I've never really gotten jealous like I always like when they move on you know what I mean when I'm gonna get a new boyfriend you just like I'll thank God that's cuz you're a comic you have opportunities yeah yeah but it's like it's like you're not their responsibility anymore yeah I mean they can still like if they're single they can still call you up you know in the middle of the night yeah still get mad about things like still let's talk about this again once dating someone else you're like alright yeah you're someone else's problem now the best is when they have a kid with someone else you like yes mm-hmm that's over baby never talk to you again I'm free yeah it's interesting that it's it's a it's an interesting thing when you decide to touch naked bodies with the person right you like create this bond by doing things with your bodies and spending time together and then you separate but you're always gonna have this yeah but I used to touch naked bodies with her you know yeah we used to get together and we used to do things together we don't do it anymore but I did it I did it back in the day I got her naked and we got naked together yeah history yeah its history it's weird you know yeah yeah shouldn't ever forget I won't either we touched each other yeah I like the idea of like relationships looking back fondly on relationships I never felt like I wasted my time the people that I've dated that I'm like probably shouldn't have done that but but for the most part I try to have good feelings about it you don't you want to hate I got a period of your life now it's pointless it but there's lessons learned those ones that I've had that we're like oh that's how you know like what when you date someone and it's cool when they're they're good you get it like I did this girl a long long time ago who's super negative just super negative all the time and then I dated this other girl right afterwards who was not negative at all she was always laughing about stuff and joking around no matter what like even it like her car getting an accent she'd take a deep breath and go well that car's fucked up and she would start laughing and I was like oh this there's different ways to handle things like if you get stuck with your high school sweetheart and and she's a pain in the ass forever like you never understand like there are the exact same circumstances one person is going to handle it differently and if you're with that person it's gonna be a totally different experience where it'll be a bonding experience versus them whoa is meaning for the next six months and bringing it back to I can't even look at a tourist because it reminds me of when I done that accident like fuck that was a year ago I like when people are together for a long time they break up and then the guy gets married to the next woman he runs into instantly instantly it's like he just like found the opposite of what he'd been dealing with and was just like so over the moon about it yeah they had to marry right away that happened nobody montt he did an actress and then it was just you know just brutal everything was career this career that was about her career was trying to help her career and and then they broke up he's like I'm never getting married again a month later he's with this new chick and he's living with her two months later and then he's married six months later I'm like what happened he goes never ever realized it wasn't that I didn't want to be married he goes I just didn't want to be married to her because I've realized like there's some people out there that I get along great with yeah and if you don't if you don't bail on a bad relationship you don't know that there's you can be and you are gonna be different that's the other thing like your D I'm different with different people you're different with something like you react better to certain people and certain people's personalities you jive better with them you have more fun with them it's more entertaining it's and you get like reintroduce yourself you know the other person knows you for this like five year period of time when maybe you weren't at your best yeah you know and like you've already used all your tricks you know I mean like if you give a girl diamond earrings you can never give her diamond earrings again for as long as you live you know I mean it's like that present is over right for now and then when you get this wound with someone new you can you know it's a clean slate right you can impress them yeah they haven't heard your fucking dumb stories all right you can like you can think I'll listen to this well I always tell guys strive to be the person you pretend to be when you're trying to get laid if you can be that person that real person all the time this is very difficult to do but if you can be that person most of the time if not all the time you'll have a better life yes I would agree with that yeah but it's fun to try to impress people it's when you meet someone like boy wait till they see how witty I am yeah yeah it's weird like with me I'm like I don't like when someone just into me just because they know who I am it you're a famous comedian I'm like a little annoyed but if they have no idea who I am I'm also a little annoyed you know it's like I think that this dish should be perks to this yeah I'm missing out on yeah did you not Google me yeah yeah he's not a comedy fan what but hey from another country what's going on uh could you imagine dating someone who didn't like comedy Anthony I love you you're amazing but I don't like stand-up I mean if it was someone who just like didn't like stand-up I thought I was great I could handle it yeah they didn't like stand-up in general but they liked your material in particular do you watch a lot of stand-up me yeah I watch it at the clubs I very rarely sit down and watch a special yeah it's true do you watch the special ever okay like right now I'm working on it and trying to put together a new hour so I'm trying to go back and watch stuff but for years I didn't watch anything but like it's funny I feel like the three comics that I watch are you - Lia and Sebastian because I follow you guys at the store so it's like I'm in the room sitting there and like you're the only three that I watch like I could like for her I could like recite your act word-for-word and I don't watch anyone else it's so funny to me well I think it's great to be again at a place like the store where you can see all these different styles and all these different people doing it and you also see how we kind of influence each other in the slightest bit and you know that we're all working in these really hot rooms or it's all packed and but I think it's good to sit down and watch you know John Mulaney and when he did his what was that where was his Radio City producer Radio City or you know Dave Chappelle wherever he did his he did his in DC I think right but the big one wasn't in DC last one I think was in LA it's the last one well he did the store with the belly room with a little one of the room he did the other one he's wearing like the military shits with a see on the oj thing with oj that was in LA and there was one in Austin they may have been one more in DC I thought the most recent bigger one was in DC but he either way maybe you're right well Jamie I'll find it but it's I think it's a it's good to see you know it's good to see how different people do it I always enjoy watching Katt Williams particularly in the beginning because you know like a lot of times he'll just run out on stage and like he's running around on stage for like five or ten minutes before the fucking first joke comes out and he's pointing at people the audience is sweating and going crazy it's and it's so different than the way anybody that I know does it it's good to see that - yeah he I think the most discussed stand-up special over the past year was not in a net it was Katt Williams his bad did you see it yes the one he did from Florida where he was up with ten minutes of Florida material about 15 minutes of Jacksonville material that is like apparently destroying that we just I couldn't get enough of it we watched watched it a hundred times yeah but it tapered off pretty hard oh yeah yeah i tapered off real hard when he was doing the Trump stuff it's like well this stuff is like half-baked yeah it looked like it looked like he had a bit that they like made him cut and so he had to just like do the hour anyway that's where I assume having watched it okay how'd they do that though they don't tell you to do shit they don't tell me to do shit I don't think they're gonna tell him to do shit it may have been like this is someone is already a bit do you know what I mean this simple as that I don't know it seemed to me that it was almost like he had some shit to say but maybe hadn't been doing a lot of stand-up you know like I don't know how much that guy works out I don't see him anywhere no I always wonder about those guys like the guys who you don't see in the clubs you know like Bill you know bill bird saw a special one day and we were doing a set together at the Ice House and he came into the green room like frothing at the mouth and he's like he goes the the fucking guy I forget I know who he's talking about I'll tell you later but he was like the fucking guy doesn't do the clubs anymore there's new clubs he goes is watching this cringy bullshit and he was like angry and it was like you got to do the fucking clubs yeah people get too comfortable you know it's just it's only their fans there's preaching to the fanbase yeah I got like Bill Maher who's not changed in anyone's mind just like people are people are applauding they're there they know they're gonna apply before they even get there yeah I would never do a comedy club he's in the comedy clubs at all no I'm sure he does not yeah yeah I think you I think you really have to yeah no I think so too yeah well he's in this weird category too right where he's not just doing comedy he's got to do everything has to be political mm-hmm cuz this whole thing is about political shit like his show his persona who he is mm-hmm you know he donated a million dollars to the Democratic Party like he's it's all politics all of it and I can't stand political humor just because it's it's so easy you know you're either you're either making everyone mad or you're making everyone really happy but it doesn't really matter like what the joke is yeah you know yeah yeah yeah it's uh and then if you're doing stuff about like the Speaker of the House okay so the Mueller report it's a fuck man like now yeah you know who's like super deep into politics on the right is Nick DiPaolo like every time I talk to him yeah and wants to talk about the fucking steel dossier yeah yeah yeah let's talk about all this different all the shit Obama did well how about when Obama did this well yeah how do you know yeah I don't even know this I know the knowledge of it like I once got a phone call before the last election like you know a year ago and they're like we want to ask you about like how involved would you say are you with politics and I'm like very action I'm pretty passionate right now and I'll inform did you say you I'm like I'm at I'm very informed and I'm like okay and they start asking me questions and I did not know what the fuck they were talking about like I hadn't heard of any of these things any of these bills like I have no idea I have no idea what's going it's like the difference between a casual sports fan and someone who really understands all the drafts and all the picks from different colleges and with this guy's got potential and this guy needs to work on his defense this here's our forty times yeah yes yeah the people who know the combine numbers yeah a benchpress 225 47 times oh yeah there's people that know that stuff and it's exhausting because it it's so involved like you have to if you really want to be paying attention to everything that's going on with Nancy Pelosi you got a you got to be paying attention that all day long mm-hmm and most people that do that they're nuts like you're it's just us it's like sports it's sports but in a different way like you're just this is the thing that you're wrapped up in mm-hmm although it does shape our world you know yeah as like right-wing comics go though there's not a lot of like nichts apollo's the king cuz he's actually really fucking funny mm-hmm like he's right-wing as like a person and and you know he's conservative him but he's also a great stand-up comedian but did he get more right yes as he got older yeah so he hasn't always I remembered the Paolo he's one of my favorites you know when I would see him on TV as a kid and I know him a little bit now but the the the right things seem to come up more and more in the past 10 years yeah he was always an angry guy but he became like an old angry guy that's really into politics as he got older yeah yeah I mean I guess part of it is like it works form like it's people love to hear it like there's not a lot of those guys like who does the right have to Bank on in terms of like comics that they could go see at Tim Allen barely does he do stand-up anymore I think he does like I think goes at the Laugh Factory does he thanks yeah okay so maybe he's one of those guys like what was last time you want to say six months ago you know I mean yeah you know I mean I don't I don't know maybe I'm wrong but who else okay so you got Tim Allen and Nick DiPaolo there's got to be more there must be I mean Norton kind of leans right a little bit more libertarian but he doesn't do a lot of politic jokes he'll talk about it but me the fuck else there's like no one but if you wanted to do like left-wing convenience you could start with Michelle wolf and work your way up oh yeah there's there's millions of them Michelle wolf wasn't even like left-wing I think the Correspondents Dinner everyone's like this is a star-making turn and I think it almost ruined her really like yes because her show Netflix was called the break like it was called the break it was a a break from all of this and just talk about like other things going on in the world we don't need to be focused on politics and after that after the Correspondents Dinner it was like the opening show was like her going after Sarah Huckabee Sanders and you're like oh you you got forced into this you know you found a niche yeah yeah it's tricky if you find a thing that like works and then people like you should really concentrate on that like I remember Jamie Masada gave a friend of mine advice once way back in the day he's like you should be Generation X guy when you go on stage you should be I'm from Generation X every time you know like my generation Generation X think this and talk like that I was giving him advice and I was like listen me don't listen to that as Jamie Masada ever given good advice I don't know as Tiffany Haddish she's still mad he manages her right so he's doing something right he's manages her yeah like recently I actually fired everybody maybe she fired him too yeah I don't know she's a wild woman she do whatever the fuck she wants now uh-huh you know but you know I'm so happy for her I knew her when the shit wasn't going well you know she's always been wild though she's so wild person she seems like yeah in a good way yeah yeah yeah just one of the two people that I saw like on stage was like oh you're gonna be a star yeah like I didn't know anything about her but I was just like you just start was it when she was queefing into the microphone no no it was not that you ever seen her do that no dude she can make the most ungodly sounds with her vagina like for real yeah oh yeah yeah she takes the microphone she puts it on her pussy and goes like she knows how to do it she has a apparently she has an ability to make a noise with her vagina on cue that I did go before her six people yeah can I get a new mic hahaha yeah I've followed her before I didn't even think about I probably should have yeah I figured like the genes are filter enough yeah you hope so yeah we'd hope yeah so it's not ideal yeah you like that type of personally that wild personality that like gallic has that house like what the fuck else could she have done other than stand up I don't know but there's a lot of those people out there that never find stand up ocean life just becomes chaos with the crazy person at the office yeah you know it's just stuck there and then you know you get fired from enough of those jobs you can't even get that office job anymore because you you know word gets out oh yeah don't hire Tiffany even that crazy bitch she's never gonna be there come when she is there she's gonna queef into the fucking loudspeaker ya know ya you this I wish I mean part of me says no I don't wish that there was like some sort of organized program to get into comedy because figure it out I figured it out you figured it out all of us did but then part of me says man there's so many kids out there there's probably a 16 year old kid right now who sees the hypocrisy in all the things these adults are doing and he fucking hates class and he's sitting there right now going nuts or there's a girl who's feeling the same way about all her stupid friends and her mom and all these fucking people that want her to be a certain way she's like Jesus Christ I really get the fuck away from these people and and she makes her friends laugh but nobody ever tells her hey listen to me you could do this you could talk shit about things like you could be a really funny comedian like you got to figure out a way to do that nobody does that like you it's so the number of people that have the but like how many people have you ever met in your life that have the potential to be a comic but never did it like we around them you're like damn this guy's funny could I go comic five or six you know there are people who were like as funny as me in college who just went on and got jobs and I got funnier you know like that I knew people like that or people one of the funniest guys I ever met in my life was like was like an executive producers PA but he was so goddamn funny I couldn't believe it but he like I don't think would have translated the stage there's something like there's something you have to figure out in yourself to become a good community and if you're the funniest guy in the world yes you know it's a different it's a different muscle you know yeah but and I like that there's so many different ways to do it like I started in LA and people like you should not start in LA Hey - yeah Ari did - I helping me because it was like you had to get good right away well re re did open mics in DC at first but then basically started out in LA when I met him he was a doorman at the Comedy Store about just a raw open mic er yeah it's hard it's hard to start out in LA but it can be done especially now especially doesn't know any better you know right I didn't I found out like years after I'd started in LA that you should not start in LA yeah and it wasn't like I was gonna move and go I was already living here when I decided to do stand-up but I wasn't gonna like move to Chicago yeah and start there oh yeah some people do mm-hmm and they it doesn't seem to work no I don't know anybody who's ever moved from LA to like a satellite community like Denver somewhere like that unless they were like already really established I don't know anybody who is starting out who moved somewhere where it worked out well no they always they come back or like they go to Austin you know I'm gonna I'm gonna try it out there it's like it doesn't you're just starting over yeah you got to start there Desai yeah yeah there's no right or wrong way to do it but man it would be nice if somebody sort of collected thoughts on how like what to do and what not to do yeah like some people are like oh you got to get in the road just get on the road and like and it's like no that that's not great advice if you're doing see rooms it's just gonna make you hate the road right I've seen people who just look like worn through that like they're just like every night they're going up and they're either like have to be like a crowd-pleaser because the comparisons just coming to see comedy like I'm so lucky people come to see Anthony Jeselnik and not just a comedy show yeah because that's that can be brutal and painful and I know a lot of people who are like no just get in the road and then their act suffers they have this like hacky act all of a sudden because they had to do it like that you know it wouldn't gives me like serious anxiety when I find out that someone got a Vegas residency I go how many nights a week six six nights a week at the stratosphere it sounds I mean someone told me David Spade was thinking about doing one ha ha ha and he went to go see Louie Anderson who was doing one this before baskets and he was like it was just the saddest thing I've ever seen that was like Carlin's Last Stand was the Vegas residency didn't you have a Vegas residency yeah where was he and I forget where he was but he had like a meltdown where he like went off on the crowd just like talk took calling in my pieces of shit really and yeah and then had to go to rehab was like I'm addicted to painkillers like and then I think he ever ever performed again well he died before he died like he was performing when he died I mean I think he was at a hotel I'm pretty sure he was sleeping in a hotel that he was performing at when he died I'll believe that but I excited and that last special he did was terrible he's like reading half of it I didn't see that it's it was it was it was just like a you know what a swan song for him but I think that was after the Vegas residency so it must have been doing more yeah his schedule was very very hectic and unusual he was doing one hour a year an hour specialty with film and he would write it all out like he would write it all out and then tweak it a little bit but it was more of a monologue than it was like setup punchline jokes and he seemed to be he was falling into this more like sort more of a social commentator in some aspects than he was a stand-up towards the end mm-hmm oh yeah someone told me that he a lot of the reason he did an hour every year was because uh like tax problems IRS has come out of hard and so we had to be working that much and it kind of made him miserable you know the story about his 9/11 story right tell me where he recorded a special called I kinda like it when a lot of people died that was the name of the special and he has his whole it closes with the big long 20 minute thing about like when he hears about people dying he like them more the better and he filmed it on like September 10 and then the next day came and was like we've got we've got to cancel this we no one can ever see this or hear this and now you can get the album but even in the album he's reading it like they destroyed the actual footage from the taping what we're healing yeah they destroyed it oh he was just like that no one can ever see this Wow recorded in Vegas at an MGM Grand on September 9th and 10th Oh September 9th and 10th that's crazy yeah what was it called but I kind of liked him a lot of people died he must have woken up the morning of September 11th and go did I manifest this yeah look at that I kind of like it when a lot of people die and so the audio CD it's just him talking it's like him working out the wait a minute it says streaming like the audio streaming with Amazon Prime's audio so there's no video of it don't look what I'll see if it is see if there is some some person who work somewhere might have preserved it I mean I feel like I would have heard about it I mean I said listen to the bit and it's if he's like I've got to read this is how I do it so it's like a very early version of it but it's not great but I mean I can't I came and imagine taping a special on September 10th he had some dark moments in his career I took some friends to see him in 1988 at the Hampton Beach casino I think that's what it was called in Hampton Beach New Hampshire was like a place of people would go up for vacation and we went to see George Carlin there way back in the day and he always had the same opening act the same opening act I kind of knew even back then because I was I guess I was an open mic or then I was just starting out I knew there were certain guys he took people on the road with them that were terrible that they took people on the road with him that just didn't they weren't good comics but they made them look like heroes and they were friends with them or because he just wanted to have like the worst comic ever go up before them it's a good question you know you'd have to I guess it would vary but for sure there's certain comics that like it when people go on in front of them suck mm-hmm they do and they want that you know there's certain comics that you see them taking people on the road and you looked you like what the fuck you're taking that guy with you like what are you doing why wait torturing people like that yeah but uh the opening act did better than George like he terrible set he had this whole rant that he was doing cuz he he had any unquestionably one of the greatest comics of all time but he had hours that were just not good and there was a period of time where it seemed like he'd just missed it like he was miss like it was missing whether it was his personal life was off or whatever it was but he had this whole rant that was like fuck this and he was like and fuck Israel and fuck comedy clubs like he was saying fuck comedy clubs like this is like this whole bit and he was reading it off of a yellow legal pad and the whole audience is like standing there like not understanding like where this was going like we're waiting for the jokes where's the hilarity where is it and it was it just didn't exist and my friends were mad at me I had taken him from where we live we lived in Revere and we all drove all the way up to New Hampshire like a we're gonna go see George Collins gonna be awesome it was terrible it's funny that louis c.k and like an interview years ago was talking about how he took the pressure came off of him today I always have a good show because said audience members loved saying oh I saw George Carlin once and he was awesome but they really love saying you know I saw Carlin once and he was horrible like they they still get the experience and the story of it and that that's it's theirs forever I can't worry about doing bad it's better though if they say you were funny I think it's our thing to see a legend bomb with me would be great well if you were Carlin fan you got to see those if you want to see him live a bunch of times he had those rough spots man you know it's um it's one of those things if you're gonna do an hour of stand-up every year if you're gonna have some rough ones there's no way around that no 100% it seems like that's just mean it can be done I think it can be done I mean I think you can put together like I'm six months in from my last special I think I could do another special six months but it wouldn't be as good as my last one I don't think yeah I just don't think it would I just think you need time yeah one of year is crazy one of years it's insane like they're guys like Jimmy Carr who while they're touring they're writing jokes and just putting them away mm-hmm so at the end of the tour when they taped the special they have all these jokes they can go through and look at and then start the new tour from that that seems like I like to sit in my set you know I mean I just wanted to be focused on that yeah and not always be writing the next thing but some people who were just like I'm just gonna go up and talk and it's happening a lot now I think with like the prevalence of Netflix specials people just want the money and they're famous enough they can just go up and just get through it I'm like this is your legacy yeah why would you want to put out a bad special ever I don't care what they're paying you mm-hmm make sure it's great I feel the same way and I feel like those people that watch that when you do do that and if you don't acknowledge that you fuck them over they're never gonna trust you again if you don't say hey look that one wasn't a good special I gave it a shot it just wasn't right it didn't come out right I thought it was pretty good and then the taping didn't go well and if you don't do that they're not gonna listen to you man they're like this is my best work like this oh this is your best work yeah well the fuck you can like fool them once yeah and I mean like if I won if I went on tour right now and just did the same material from the special like people would be like okay but they're not coming back the next time right you know they're gonna get mad at you yeah yeah yeah when you do a special once it's on Netflix you're done with that material it's over done I know people I try not even to remember it like I'm an idiot in the way that I like assume that the entire audience has seen everything I've ever done good like I really do think that and it's like even if it's one guy in the back who's like I've heard these before no one else has heard it it still drives me crazy yeah that I can't I don't it's I've got too much pride I have the same feeling and I'll say sometimes too and here's like if something comes up I go I have an old bid on this and I'll say the bit but I'll let them know this is an old bit like this is you know I got this old bit yeah somebody some people though they when cuz someone comes to see like Jim Gaffigan they what if they see hot pockets oh they get fucking man I suck African in Toronto a couple years ago and he did a killer hour just walks out does the hour says thank you good night walks off stage walks right back on and does hot pockets doesn't ask who wants to hear hot pockets just goes right into it does the whole ten-minute thing and then says good night and walks off stage yeah well Burt crisis that way with the Machine mm-hmm like he has to tell that fucking story yeah even though people seeing it they want to see it live mm-hmm yeah he's trapped and I mean if I had more stories I could get away with it my nights it but once you hear the joke you know it's it's over yeah it doesn't doesn't work again yes Seinfeld still does old old stuff he does really old stuff and he's done two specials of old stuff that he's that like he's already put on specials I went and saw him at the Palladium about a year or two ago and it was one of the worst shows I've ever seen like I had like a splitting headache and I was like furious really and one of my friends another comic that I respect a lot gave him a standing ovation and I was like are you fucking kidding me news like I understand why you feel the way you do but I just love seeing the act and I was like I couldn't believe it and then I saw a Seinfeld again at cluster fest he was in the big outdoor stage with a bunch of like four kids completely different hour and murdered like destroyed it was like he has like corny stuff depending on what what the audience you know is if everyone's sitting there wearing a yarmulke he's got one act and if it's a bunch of kids he's got it he's got a cool hip act really yeah so you went to the yarmulke crowd yeah interesting what was bad about that it was aggressively corny and just Courtney's a funny phrase yeah good like you'd like thank you for coming to the show I know you know we like should we go to the show should we go actually go to the show we get to be new birds how do we get to show do we really want to go to now I'm like I can't believe he's doing this right now but people were eating it up like everyone around me was going nuts and loving it but it was just like old man corny could you see Seinfeld on like a talk-show and he's like mean kind of biting you like oh this is great like he's hilarious and I expected more of that but when I saw him enclosed confessed I got that you know what is cluster first it's that it's like there it's the third year this year that festival in San Francisco like it's a Comedy Central and Coachella together a put together a thing it's all comedy comedy music mr. music gonzo whenever I see festivals I always assume someone's getting ripped off that's what I think my impression is or who's getting the money who's getting the money out of this that's how I feel about like Montreal there's the occasional there being a festival you're like okay this much for for like one show in Toronto like yeah I'm totally in I'm totally so sometimes it's great and sometimes it's nothing yeah the Just for Laughs thing my issue with that is I got in when I was a zero like I got in just for laughs when I was four years in the comedy I think five I was terrible you know I had like a 10-minute set that I could do and it could get some laughs but I became a part of Just for Laughs like when it was helping me I wasn't helping it mm-hmm but then when I see festivals where I see like a lot of names on a thing and I'm like well who's funding this like sponsored by Southwest Airlines like what is this a weird corporate mishmash that you put together and who's profiting off of this mm-hmm like it's not the comedian's like I get you put it all together but then you find out how much can me how much the comedians are getting like where's the rest of the money going there's a lot of money in that audience it's a big place yeah you know just so I'ma better than others but like and sometimes there's like we're gonna take a loss all the sponsors are gonna lose money on this but we're gonna like that Riot Fest in LA they would do it for you it's it's done now but they didn't like four or five years in a row no no no never made money it was a Comedy Festival in downtown LA really yeah see that's how much I I haven't versioned those things I don't even know when they're taking place cuz I say no to everything I'm like no you know you're not just priced out of it no just like people are like oh I don't I haven't done to college in years and it's not like I've got a problem of colleges it's just like they can't afford well I stopped doing colleges when they could afford me because I just would just I would be performing in front of a teen year-olds I'm like this is ridiculous it's just like there's too many of them that don't have life experience there they're growing minds and you can make them laugh at some things but they haven't experienced what what I like it's like I'm happily married but if I wasn't I'd like a chick who's a little bitter I like a older chick keeps yourself fit there's experienced a lot in life who understands she understands that life is up and down there's hardships I'm not interested in anyone who's young and delusional and bubbly ya know that when you go to perform front of 18 year-olds like they have this like this delusional version of what the world should be and social justice and all these ideas about the economy and all these ideas about socialism and all these ideas like I'm exhausted already I can't I can't do this I still think it's fun I think it's fun to watch them just be like holy shit you'll have to do one show I mean it's like like maybe they can leave if they want I don't feel any pressure worm casinos more than more than colleges but I loved like even if it went bad it was an interesting bad and you're and you're getting paid so much money that you're like I don't care I don't care how this goes and I've had some go realized to go to the college and say what should I not talk about and then whatever they said I would open with that and it worked every time except Colorado School of Mines what is that the Colorado School of Mines isms it's like a it's a engineering school like a gorilla yeah School of Mines mines yeah it's a famous mi n E or mi ND mi n e oh okay like digging I thought you're saying mines - I was with Jo and they said do not talk about abortion and I was like okay and I went up and open with an abortion joke and then died for an hour like they never forgave me I just completely ate shit was it a good abortion joke I assumed to have a bad abortion joke is if you gonna tell suck right I have a joke about abortion it'd better be great you know or your or you're in some real trouble well there are those people that think that when you touch on controversial subjects that there's like a little there's weight to objects right like there's certain things that have more wait to them like if you can get through if you can actually get the bit to work it will have like an artificial amount of momentum connected to it because the fact that there's all this weight yes it's more tension yeah you can cut that tension the laughs is bigger yeah sure yeah but if you can't oh no it's over yeah yeah they just like Maddie for even trying yeah you know I don't think people get mad really that people make jokes about awful things they get mad the idea that people think it's funny yeah you know it's not so much you told a cancer joke it's like you think cancers funny it's like no I don't that's why I'm making a joke about it you know that's like it's that's that's the process but I really think it's like it's hearing an audience laugh at it's more than hearing comic like if a comic tells a cancer joke and it bombs no one really gets mad at them if it's like killing that's when people get upset well your act is so controversial you have so many subjects and it's so much tongue-in-cheek and there's so much where you're you know you you say mean shit on stage I would imagine that you get people upset at you quite a bit I used to and honestly now it's like I've been like grandfathered in and like it's funny like I used to get people I would tweet a joke and some people would the comments of people getting mad at me and now what happens is that tweeted joke and then my fans start tweeting their own jokes underneath it like people get mad at them it's like I'm just like the guy who is allowed to do it people just stopped getting mad at me all of a sudden and I well you had a show called the Jeselnik offensive mm-hmm I mean it's a you you do you are sort of grandfathered in but it's also like your style yeah it's like it's like being mad at Slayer for being loud mm-hmm like what do you that's what they do exactly what are you talking about yeah I'm like but I like classical music it's like so what go listen to that yeah yeah that is the weird thing about comedy too right it's like when you go to see comedy you could see all sorts of different styles whereas when you go to see music if you go to a club it's like a blues club you expect to see Blues like you're going there on purpose you don't it's not like a blues band followed by a country band followed by a hardcore band it doesn't but that's what you get when you go to a comedy club you can get Guns and Roses followed by Barry Mann like what is this place yeah you know like Oh a main room show on a Saturday night you're gonna get virtually every genre of comedy there is mm-hmm well I mean I'd like that I'm glad it's like that because I hate like I when I used to tour and I couldn't bring my own opener you know I would get to Tallinn but Oh Jake has been begging us to open for like when to open for you so badly for months we so we're letting him open for you and he does my act for 15 minutes before he brings me onstage I hate this yeah someone actually do your actual material not my material but like though my mannerisms you know short dark jokes you know like that my attitude they've just like taken it and they're like aw he Anthony sees me he'll be like oh you're like me come do that I'm like I don't want to see me you know I don't see anyone like me ever I don't want it's like someone's like oh this guy does really dark one-liners you'd love it I'm like I don't ever want to see it I don't ever want to look at it because that's what I do right you know I like I want to see goofy silly just like the opposite of me yeah Joey Diaz likes to bring girls onstage he brought likes to bring girls on the road with him because he said he wants the audience to see something totally different anyone to give the women in the audience that are with their boyfriends that are there to see him like he's like this is good like it'll balance it out I bring a lot of female openers mostly just I went completely different I don't want the same even like I don't I'm talking about the same subjects that's me yeah you know and then and that's you that usually avoids it completely I don't know I don't know how much I'm doing it for the the girlfriends of the the guys who have come then certainly you know they're people come afterwards and like I I liked you better than the headliner it's like his we're gonna start taking someone on the road with you and then their acts starts morphing I'm becoming like yours like their style sort of could they see what what's working and so they start it's like a natural thing like like you saying you can't watch the tell anymore you know especially with someone who's opening for you got to think they're in the developmental period oh yeah I thought emcees do by the end of the weekend they're like that's a great joke and I'm like that's my line like you can't I know it's fun to do but like you can't do it when you're opening from me like you've just been watching me all weekend and now you're copying my manner that's annoying yeah because then you have to think about it mmm-hmm we have to watch them is there any places where you just don't work anymore like any cities where you like fuck this place do you work in Miami Miami I try not to I'll do a theater in Miami or like close by but I'd I would never do a club down there like Miami's like New Orleans and New Orleans is one of my favorite cities in the world but like they have shit going on yeah they don't care about your comedy right no Miami there's just too much else to do and New Orleans we've got like their music and their food and their alcohol they don't care about comedy like you can you can do a show there but it's not it's not that fun it's not that fun yeah but Miami might be the one but I'll do like Fort Lauderdale you know it places around that yeah Florida can be tough Miami ajaces yes all right it's tough man yeah it's tough that's a that is the weirdest fucking state in the country for sure mm-hmm yeah trying to think of any other place that I was like there clubs I would never go back to what about Connecticut Connecticut I think I just did somewhere in Connecticut and had a great I had a great time I like they were just like they were like grateful that I was there some places to go and they're just like oh I can't believe you came here yeah this is awesome yeah but there was I went to one club where just like the owner of the club made his made the green room his office and we're just sitting there and like be watching TV and talking to me the entire time like it surely you're going to leave with 20 minutes before I go onstage and just what just in your face the whole time like that was why he owned the club was to talk to comics and I just like know lost my mind where was this I probably shouldn't say but I would don't say would it sound like Columbus Ohio I think losers think what Hoosiers Hoosiers were there Indiana next door to okay okay you ever been there um I think I did a show there once yeah yeah what's coming up it was like it was like a cool club to go do and then I finally got there and I can okay you're so ago and I was like you know my friends I was like why did you why is everyone loved this club so much and then like we couldn't wait to hear what you thought of him we couldn't wait to hear how mad you would get of this guy the weird thing is when a guy owns the club but then he's also the emcee you very well happen oh the worst the absolute worst I can't stand that yeah that's not good no yeah is there any places in overseas you really enjoy working yeah I went on a big European tour this summer and did did the standards you know did a couple nights in London couple nights in Edinboro during the festival those were fun and then like places off the beaten path that dad was like I want to do Berlin and I want to do Warsaw and they're like there's no market and I'm like I want to do those those are the two most fun shows of the whole torn it was like 300 people maybe but but they were just so grateful you were there and they were they were awesome and they understand English like you would think they understand it better than they can speak it so they laugh at every joke nothing goes over their heads they don't they change any references I've really loved the European tour that's cool because if you do in a place of like 300 seats even if it's a primarily you know German or polish speaking country there's gonna be enough people that speak English that can come to your show mm-hmm yeah a lot of expats you know and like and they they all say they got comedy ten years ago YouTube is what did it for them so they all they have these stand-up comedy scenes that are all ten years old and they're all like they're they're like bad for people to do doing it ten years old they're still hacky you know they're like a generation away from from getting good by Amber in Warsaw they were like this is a historic day for Polish comedy like you're the first American comic like big American comedy to come here into a show and now I think Birds going there or maybe just went there but they're they're getting more and more people Warsaw what is Poland like honestly we like got into the airport ass our luggage was wasn't there went straight to the gig went on stage went to the hotel and the next morning flew to Budapest like we didn't get to see any of Warsaw or do anything there I was one of the cities it was just there was just nothing to do but when I had my old Comedy Central show the Jeselnik offensive someone at Comedy Central says listen we can look at Google and tell you where your googled all around the world America by far the most Canada close second and then water and then Poland is number three and I like Poland why and they go they think you're polish you look polish they think they assume you're polish so I'm like let's book a show there and have all these people come out and whoever told me that fucking lied to me like they would they were like what we don't think you're polish like why would you think you're polish like no we don't give a shit I don't know who told you that what is Jeselnik Slovenian ah yeah you ever go there no never been never want to do a show there it's kind of um I think I thought about it but it was just like routing you know what I mean it's like do I want to deal with what I have to deal with to get to Slovenia right when I can just go you know from do Australia at all yeah I just did Australia I did like I did a few weeks like one week at the very end of the tour would you do I did Brisbane Adelaide Melbourne and Sydney Melbourne and Sydney is the only places I've done but it's fucking no great I love this - yeah if the World War 3 hits and that that place doesn't get nuked that's the spot you think so yeah it's the other side of the planet wasn't there book though where like that happens and everyone goes to Australia but there's like a cloud of radiation coming that's eventually gonna get them fuck maybe we just get a big fan blow that shit Russia I bet that would work look if they can figure I had a new can entire country with a few bombs that drop out of airplanes or shoot out of rockets they should build a giant fan build a big fan yeah why is that so hard like I was reading the shit about space junk do you know how much space junk there is like this stars a lot floating around in space like thousands of pieces of shit just flying around broken satellites is it all just broken satellites or like kinds of shit yeah all kinds of stuff stuff from you know like when Rockets take off and then they eject they leave little pieces of stuff up in there and and is it like in a ring like a Saturn type of ring or is it just everywhere it's everywhere it's all over the planet it's like it cut it's in the sky like it's in the Oshin it's like there's pieces of shit just flying around above our head and like they have to be cognizant about it if they're gonna launch a rocket yeah like you could run into it space debris and human spacecraft they all travel at speeds up to 17,500 miles an hour more than 500,000 pieces of debris or space junk are tracked as the orbit earth think of that they travel at speeds up to 17,500 miles an hour small enough for a relatively small piece of orbital debris to damage a satellite or a spacecraft that's how was it moved with Sandra Bullock yes gravity yeah yeah this junk to consumers yeah they're like fixing a satellite and something comes by and like hits mix it and the next thing you know yeah that shit can happen and they don't know what to do either like to throw a net up there what are you gonna do Oh thinking like some kind of like magnet satellite it would just attract everything right but then it would probably get too heavy I think we'll probably take out things you need oh yeah is this the junk that we can track over time it starts at 57 there's only two things out there and we're so gross I bet the oceans a similar similar story Wow look at all the shit around even worse oh my god that's incredible that's all real 2015 the entire low you know like near Earth orbit is covered with shit space debris satellites and nonsense I mean at what point in timing we've only been traveling into space since the 1960s right so what when is this gonna end like that's that's not that long ago that's 50-plus years ago what we're gonna do when it's a hundred years from now five hundred years from now I mean we are we gonna be able to see the Sun we just look up and just see spaceship it said there's only 500,000 pieces of the Earth's a pretty fucking big still we'd have to get yeah a lot I guess I had a Snapple factor that it so if you dug a hole through the earth it would take you 42 minutes to fall through it it's like how fucking big is that so it's a long long row it's a long for Austin I think would you stop in the middle edye get cooked I know but in theory but if you didn't yeah yeah if it was just a tube on a zero temperature or neutral temperature tube I wonder how like how accurate snapple facts really have to be bullshit on a Snapple fact I don't drink that shit so I don't read those things I didn't know they had Snapple facts until you just said that I didn't they used to have like little things on the caps like you say it makes sense to me but I don't think I've ever read one of them nice to always read them no yeah I can't remember any of you get angry Oh Snapple fact no I have gotten mad at like a bazooka Joe comic let's make this fuck it you're kidding me yeah a phone it in something yes big time well comics in general I think is some like there's great comics there's really funny comics but then there's comic strips that have existed forever and they're fucking terrible and for some reason or another they just still exist oh yeah do they anymore though I guess they're still a sec I haven't read a newspaper like a physical print and I think it's smaller and smaller than it ever has been before but like they're still cranking out Garfield you know Garfield still a thing yeah and the guy Jim Davis great Garfield has nothing to do with it he's like golfing and like collecting money and it's and he's got ghost writers so it's just like the worst shit ever oh wow so he hires people to do it and he makes all the money mm-hmm he's probably worth a billion dollars no I guarantee the merchandise does fucking things you stick in your car alone I'm proud those were everywhere yeah they're like yeah it's all so I think the Calvin and Hobbes guy would never let them make toys of Calvin and Hobbes what the books yeah he didn't want that money at Calvin and Hobbes play he didn't want he didn't want his creation being like he didn't wanna be like Jim Davis you know that's why I think the best like the best comic ever got to be Gary Larson's the farside those things fucking hold up you ever read those back in the day he read of rate right and then who did Doonesbury the that's like the political one right she still is that his name maybe yeah what the fuck who the fuck was it Trudeau what's his first name Gary Trudeau isn't that what's the name the guy runs Canada Justin that guy yeah I never got tunes bro I never like it was like too clever I was like okay then I guess they're taking down Ronald Reagan or something but the fuck they're talking about doonesbury is weird too because they basically they pigeon-holed Hunter s Thompson and turned him into this they had a character that they were doing I think he wound up suing them yeah there's his character it's basically the exact same guy just slightly different and he was always like shooting off guns and doing a bunch of crazy shit I forget his name I forget the name of the guy they gave him a different name like uncle something or another yeah but that was there I mean that was Gary Trudeau's take on Hunter s Thompson and it wound up driving hunter arrest Thompson nuts is this still real he's still doing like he's doing Trump this that's 2017 Wow Wow yeah but he so he created this character that was basically the most exaggerated versions of Hunter as Thompson when Hunter as Thompson was fucking around and it sort of defined who hunter as Thompson was to a lot of people because instead of being as brilliant journalist who you know great writer he also became this kind of like guy just shoots guns and is always drunk yeah yeah and then you fall into that trap I think comedians that have a persona like oftentimes fault like you know dice is that's not you know his real name is Andrew silverstein and the dice character was a part of his act he's had a bunch of different things he would do impressions we didn't revolt impression yeah yeah phenomenal yeah phenomenal Travolta oppression and then the dice man became like a part of his act and then he just decided that's the best part so I'm just gonna do dice all the time and then he decided no I'm fucked living like a regular person it was gonna be dice time so he became the guy in his act I mean that's who he is like most of the time oh yeah yeah Kinnison Kinnison done similar similar situation I never met Kinnison Kinnison I mean he died well before I got into stand-up but I've never met dice and I've always like sang his praises like I think the day the laughter died is one of the greatest comedy albums of all time and and I've just never met him he's great yeah I'll introduce you next time I see him at the store if you're there I've heard great stories he must like he must know who I am oh yeah yeah I once did govern what he wasn't will you be mad I wouldn't be mad I would be surprised just because I've spoken about him publicly that like mm-hmm if he was what if who's wondering why he sold like a thousand copies that the day the laughter died after I like talked about it on a podcast like he would hear that you know someone says something nice about you you find out but I was at governor's once and they were like all probably like dice was here last weekend and he left one of his gloves you know fingerless gloves and I was just like give it to me like what do I have to do to take this glove home but I still have Alec where I'm wet around sometimes it's fun do you write jokes with it oh I'll walk around like just doing the doing a little oh yeah yeah but uh but yeah love love that but those characters when guys get lumped into a character and you get locked into that it can be very self defining you know of course for Kennison i think it was very self defined a big time I mean I thought about that when I was like creating my persona it was like what's gonna age well hmm you know like not like I think of a guy like Nick Swardson you know who's just like party of atomic okay like he's a college kid forever right it's like that how long can you do that for you know it's like still kind of has to do it and it's still great but I'm like are you enjoying this you know like I want to be able to like kind of hold on to my dignity you know his best version of it emo Philips yes that's the best example because it's like wow like cuz when he was a young sort of cute guy it was kind of strange to watch him go calm like this when you're 60 though and you're doing that people like hey man this is just weird yeah like bobcat talked about that like that Bobcat had this moment where he stopped being Bobcat and people like hey man how can he not do his scream he's like fuck you I'm not doing it I hate told me the best story ever he said he's in he's at a Comedy Works in Denver doing a weekend and he's eating shit every show and every show he's just bombing and everyone's going do the voice do the voice and he's like no no I don't do the voice anymore I'm not doing the voice Late Show Saturday someone in the back yells we're from Aurora do the voice for us and he goes oh you're from Aurora at least you learned to sit in the back and he said this is like a year after the shootings yes are you here after that and he said the entire audience the entire audience just pretended he didn't say it they didn't boo they didn't laugh they just acted like nothing had happened and he did the rest of the show he said he made the whole weekend worth of fun just to say that yeah dude I was speaking of which I was watching a video today you know how YouTube for whatever reason just starts recommending things and you can click on it watching a video today on oh this is what it was I was looking at bulletproof clothing for whatever reason because it was like I saw an ad on Instagram where this guy had a bulletproof hoodie on and it looked like a regular hoodie and shot himself is it like a John wick situation where it's like yes it's like it's like shown in yeah yeah so this guy had a regular hoodie and he shot himself in the gut with a nine-millimeter just bang Wow while I was playing this video with like a regular hoodie I was like this is crazy and this hoodie it looked like a regular hoodie was but it's some sort of Kevlar or something so then it recommends this next thing and this next video that I watch is on whether or not you should carry with a bullet in the chamber so it's this guy who's just speculating like that there's two kinds of people there's kind of people that thinks they're gonna have enough time to rack a bullet and there's a bunch of people that realize when something happens it's like being in a car accident happens quickly and you got to be prepared you're not gonna have enough time to rack a bullet and so there was this long discussion as to whether or not you should have a bullet in the chamber or not when you conceal carry and he was talking about how this guy was open carrying but he could see that the guy's the hammer was shut down on the pistol which means he's gonna have to cock it because it was a not a revolver but you know whatever an ottoman semi what is it when what is it when you call what are you calling those when you have to load it like that look at nine-millimeter Glock what is the difference well one's a revolver revolver revolves so it's not a revolvers just a pistol anyway he was saying because the way the hammer was he could tell that this guy you know he was gonna have to pull that hammer back he was gonna use that gun and I was like this is this is like next-level thinking like these people everywhere you go someone's worrying about shooting you and then I go onto Twitter almost like this is synchronicity and Eric Weinstein as a friend of mine says is this the the year where the debate is some something in terms of is it appropriate to bring a loaded gun into a place where you worship now to protect yourself because there's been so many attacks on people and synagogues and churches and mosques and I'm like fuck man we're probably what what is happening here it's I mean it's bad I don't I'm not like there's nothing good today what do you mean there's two more attacks today at synagogues this one was in a church what were the ones that that happened today there was two smaller ones there was no as there was a church that was in San Diego this weekend no the the synagogue in San Diego this weekend but there was another one like this morning when I was reading the news Los Angeles yes yeah what was a former 26 year old US Army soldier served on see Anniston has been charged with plotting terror attacks in los angeles-area rally in Long Beach so I thought it's on the front pages he had never had something like it some sounds leaking through the video did he do something or did he just got caught plotter it says he was accused of targeting Jews as they walked to a synagogue police officers a military facility and crowds at the Santa Monica Pier I think there was another one too there was another one somewhere else might might have been outside the country today it's like fuck like this shit is ramping up yeah I'm just getting worse and worse are you a gun guy I have guns I wouldn't say I'm a gun guy but I have them hunting or like just don't realize I have hunting guns and I have safety guns like security guns or private you know personal protection guns and but I hunt with a bow and arrow mostly but of course I'm not opposed to when you say of course being sarcastic I'm not opposed to it was this California synagogue attack latest oh this is the they found a social media message I guess right before it happened of course Jesus Christ no I don't know I think there was some another one and I saw I believe it was in another country that's all right it's enough there's so many I know I know you just numb to it well also that their chart targeting places of worship now like what the fuck man do you have guns no would you ever won one they make me uncomfortable like I'm not like against people want to have guns okay I'm not done that it's not a hill I'm going to die on but I think what's happening with with schools and and and churches is reprehensible and it's we are the only country where this really happens you know as not anymore I mean it's happening you know around the world but it's it's much more often here yeah yeah no there's there's certainly an argument for that the real problem is the guns already there it's like how do you what do you do when you live in a country of 300 plus million people with 300 plus million guns how do you ever eradicate that how do you ever how do you shift the path that we seem to be on thank what you do I mean everything is like you know people talk about this and then like you know how do we do what's is it the culture is it this and you turn on the TV and it's like a video game commercial or a commercial for a movie and it's just a supermodel spinning around in circles shooting everything she sees you know like you don't think this is having an effect well like they just make it look so cool that if you want to be the hero you gotta have a gun you know how about John wick John wick three comes my fucking favorite thing ever and I'm like this is the most glorifying gun shit ever but I love it right it is a problem I mean it hasn't made me turn to guns you know me I wouldn't say that like video games you know make this video games are making people more violent I don't I don't believe that I don't know if there there's evidence to back that but I mean I've always loved you know James Bond movies you know things like where guns are are a big part of it and it's never made me want to pick one up well there's a real argument that that alleviates some of the need for violence that people like seeing it and in seeing it and something like John wick it actually relaxes people mm-hmm there's a real argument for that and there's a real argument that you can make with that with videogames too but that it's not with everybody the problem is certain people are very susceptible to influence they're susceptible they're vulnerable to being influenced or excited in one particular direction whether it's excited to become radicalized and become a white nationalist want to shoot up you know whatever figure out that whatever the group is or whether it's you know there's certain people that you know they'll see something in a movie or a video game it'll make them want to act that out but they're usually mentally ill I mean that's that's a real problem the real problem is mental illness it's the type of person that could go into a synagogue and just start shooting people that's a mentally ill person that's yeah regardless of whether or not they have a gun or not that's a sick person so we have to figure out like what's causing this massive amount of mental illness in this country because that's a big it's that's the guy in aurora is a perfect example that guy was they knew he was sick then they knew there was something really I mean you see him photos of that fucking look at his eyes completely batshit crazy I think is something to like when they when they now they've started to refuse to show the guy's face you know they won't show eggs ugh this guys getting glory now and the next shooter wants to top that right that I think they're getting a little bit smarter about it but what's that what's the quote no man chooses evil because it's evil they only mistake it for happiness mmm like I believe that yeah that's a good quote yeah they mistake it for happiness or they want other people to feel what they feel mm-hmm they want other people to suffer the way they're suffering yeah what I mean when you ever have a giant country filled with people you're going to have a broad spectrum of people's experiences and so you're going to have a certain number of people that are on the low end of experiences the worst experiences all the time sexual abuse physical abuse violence mental illness pills drugs this that boom but like Japan is one of the most unhappy countries in the world people that the suicide rate is off the charts but they take themselves out yeah you know in America it's like let me who can I take with me yeah I don't know what that what that is well Japan emphasizes humility and they reward it like if in the emphasize being polite and orderly it's really interesting there was a piece I was watching on YouTube of these people that live in cyber cafes that they have cyber cafes that are open 24 hours a day in Japan and they have like this little cubicle so you take in there and they're just online on their computer and they have all their things there and that's what they live and they shower then they go back to the little cubicle but this woman was saying that it made her feel like she wasn't alone but she wasn't with people either like she likes that that like she wants to know that there's people around her but she doesn't want anybody in her life it was dark yeah yeah that's super fucking dark sad just the loneliness like that that's a giant issue apparently in Japan is how lonely people are which is incredibly ironic when you consider that it's probably one of the most population densities on earth in Tokyo at least oh yeah I'm just working their asses off I mean they fucking loved it the jump in front of trains they live for it like it really is like the country's it's it's the least happy country in the world Wow I think number like the happiest is like someone scanned in a more great you know yes yeah yeah Finland I think Finland like ranks very highly on that yeah why the the thing I was watching said it was like a sense of community I think them lived together and like they eat their meals together as like a neighborhood almost and they just like everyone contributes and they're just happy and content that makes sense the numbers are smaller - mm-hmm I think that that helps also it's gorgeous up there that helps - mm-hmm a lot of factors here right yeah like what's a big city in finland helsinki how many people is at 50 how many people live in helsinki physi fifty-fifty yeah okay you're right I would I bet Helsinki as 1.2 million people how many people he'll think you have that's a wild guess I don't know why I had to put the point two in there I'm hedging my bet if I was on The Price is Right that's the biggest but the thing I pull up doesn't say the second-largest says 279,000 well say what he'll think he does well doesn't you can't doesn't if you google population of Helsinki that's the very first thing I had was the biggest cities in Finland I figured it would I had it oh it was about 558 550 8,000 yeah doesn't shit Wow that's it that's why they're happy hmm he's basically like four boulders yeah four Boulder Colorado sand it's a whole country yeah yeah you go to Boulder that some of the nicest people ever why 100,000 of them is it hard to build they're beautiful Boult beautiful yeah gorgeous great people a little on the socialist side but I get it a little too many Birkenstocks and tayyaba's and girls could use a little bit more makeup pull the makeup on gals it's not lit up a little it's not pronounced Eva maybe this divas I've even heard the word in there weird leather sandals and shit but it's a cool place man but I think you know that's what you get if you live around nature you get a bunch of fit people that like hiking and share a lot of north face jackets mm-hmm you know they got great weather you yeah they'd really do they have blizzards and snowstorms and shit but they also have like you'll it'll be 30 degrees in Denver or Boulder and then the next day it'll be 60 yeah he doesn't make any sense Oh would you say Denver is the best comedy town in the country it's up there it's up there I fucking love it there I me too I'm going there in August I'm doing that place again I fucking love it yeah it's one of my plate favorite places on the planet period like if I was gonna leave LA Denver's one of the spots that I would pick I think about like when I eventually leave where would I go and Denver's uh Denver's at the top of the list I used to want to go to like Seattle or Portland mm-hmm and then I read that article that terrifying article about how like not just like the talks about the big one earthquake in LA they're like what's really gonna fuck shit up is the tsunami that's gonna have on that fault line they're like Portland in Seattle are gonna be gone with that tsunami 100% right hundred percent yeah it's just whether it's a hundred years from now or - mmhmm oh my gosh if we wake up one day and Seattle's gone 13 million people dead it goes deep into Washington State all the way to coma the ocean goes to Tacoma oh there was an article where they like talked about like what how what would happen like woman had like minute by minute in Portland with this with this going on it was just terrifying yeah fuck that too risky also seasonal depressions real oh for sure I have a buddy mining move - he moved to Portland and started you Jitsu school out there and I was like do you like it he was like dude I fucking love it I go you don't miss LA at all he was like no I what about the rains it Bobby it's like no no it's nothing two years later he's back in LA I got what happened he goes the fucking weather I go you liar okay you try to convince me you were trying to tell me and he started laughing he's like I just convincing myself yeah he bought into it he goes I go what happenings I came back one time and when it was raining out there and it wasn't raining here and I was like what am i doing like no I'm less happy they're like it makes you less happy if it's raining all the time it makes you less happy oh yeah rain if you live in LA and it rains we're all happy like oh this is cool it's raining now a vitamin D is important it's not just vitamin D either it's like a feeling you get like you're gonna be cold and wet you're gonna be cold and wet and gonna bundle up and get inside quickly get inside mm-hmm you can't just be free can't be outside sitting in the grass eatin lunch just looking out relaxing yeah I like my hammock yeah fuck that place and then fuck places that have like too much snow too like all the people that want to move back to New York I'm like you can keep that good luck with that yeah that New York the summer and the winters would kill me in New York I've been waiting for the subway when you're just like dripping sweat was just brutal dripping sweat with moist piss smell everywhere mm-hmm that moisture but that's carrying those piss odor molecules in the subway like what in the fuck are you people breathing in down here and I never got the rubber boots you know what I mean I was always just like had sneakers I'm like trying to get trying to get the Fallon at like 7:00 in the morning walk into the subway through the slush oh it was like it'd be beautiful while it was snowing and then as soon as on the ground you were just like get rid of this shit now did you write for Fallon uh-huh what was that kid like I mean it was it was frustrating they didn't like because it I started when he started Late Night with Jimmy Fallon I was one of the first guys there and they didn't like any of my jokes like it was just it was it was who possible to mean or just like this is gonna make Jimmy unlikable like just it wasn't about being funny so much as like coming off as smart and and friendly you know unlikable that they that's what I was there for a year and then they barely used anything I ever did but they knew I was funny they liked me and I thought for some reason in my head I thought that if I quit before a year that it'll like follow me people like what happened with Fallon well you only there a year that like and then I when I left it was like no one would have given a shit if I'd left after 10 weeks you know wouldn't have mattered at all yeah it was it was good an interesting experience but I did not enjoy it being a writer for other people's voices has got to be very difficult it's I mean for me it's impossible it's like I write in my voice and you either like it or you don't like I've written for Jimmy Kimmel Sarah Silverman and then if I love the joke they loved it too but with Fallon it was not the case you know he was it was almost never okay he might he would laugh at the joke but he bug I can't say this I can't do it what are they trying to do what does he try to do he's trying to be like Middle America like there's a not a market for that right is that what it is he just wants everyone to love him you know he just wants everyone to everyone to love him that's like not a bad trait to having a late-night host right probably the best trait to have ana late night host mm-hmm I'd like to see him drunk one day just shitting on everybody the thing would be hilarious is Louis doesn't do that oh yeah I mean I've heard that he quit drinking I know that's true but he would like he liked to get drunk and like in like shitty bars and like hang out like with the with the staff and the crew like he was he's like a man of the people and he didn't just want to go home and drink he wanted to go
