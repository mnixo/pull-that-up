accom oh and and I T Anna's here the party started all right the music the Joe Rogan experience thank you for having me super excited Kasparian yes Turks which is you guys are like the new media right looks like yes old media and there's new media yeah establishment media and new media I'm actually working on a book about it I mean I'm not 100% sure that it's gonna be published so I don't want to you know give too many details it's work something I'm working on now but I got to experience that transition from establishment media to new media and there are really important differences and just this whole media revolution that's happening that's really exciting for anyone who's interested in journalism and I mean you're part of it with this podcast allegedly you are you are allegedly and it's a it's it's a really great way for people who want to be heard without being censored you know I can basically say anything I want on my show without worrying about anyone telling me hey you can't say this you can't say that yeah we have corporate sponsors we got to make sure the advertisers you know continue giving us money what's fascinating is all you have to do is be interesting entertaining informative and that's it it doesn't have to have CNN on it or Fox on it or any of these other names that we've attributed so like meaning what the news is where the news comes from definitely I mean when I first started working at TYT it was this unknown show it had been around for a few years but it was a really big risk for me to work there because I was working at CBS radio at the time and CBS radio had like a very clear path for me you start off as an assistant producer your work you will work your way up and if you're good enough and persistent enough you'll be an anchor and you'll be fine you know you'll be set for life with TYT it was just this huge risk because it was unknown I didn't know if it would survive at the time was on this radio station called Air America I don't know if you heard remember that yeah the folks at TYT stands for the Young Turks yeah the young case you're on a plane with no Google and so I just remember being really unhappy at CBS feeling like you know even if I get to the the top of the ladder within this company I'm not gonna feel fulfilled doing what they're doing and the first day I worked at The Young Turks I heard jankura the main host of the show go on this rant against the Bush administration and some of the ridiculous you know civil liberty violations civil liberties violations that they were accused of guilty of not not even accused of and I was like wow you do not see this in the media you don't see this type of honesty you don't see people go off like that they're usually very senatorial whenever they're doing any type of commentary and I was tired of it I wanted some real news coverage so that's why I made the decision that I made and I and I left and thank God I made that decision because TYT actually succeeded in big ways in what year do you think it was were you know it started to shift because it seems like to me it's maybe three five whatever years it is but within the last few years there's this shift where my friends don't ever talk to me about what they saw on CNN they don't talk to me what they saw in Fox News it's always I read this online i watch this online I saw The Young Turks I watched this show I watched this guy's podcast and this guy said I mean everybody that I talk to is talking about stuff that they're getting when they're talking about real issues they're talking about stuff they're getting online yeah well a lot of things have changed people don't rush home to watch a newscast anymore and people also know that there are corporate interests involved in traditional media you know you see advertisements for things that you can't even buy on traditional media like I see advertisements for this company called Siemens and I'm like what are they trying to sell me and you realize that they're not trying to sell the consumer anything it's a form of control over the network BP has a bunch of advertisements on mainstream media and if they are the people that are paying your bills you are less likely to be critical of their business practices so with with traditional media you have that issue and I think people are now more and more aware of it and with online media it's on demand okay it's raw we cuss we say whatever the hell we want without worrying about censorship and people like that it's there's something really refreshing about it you know they didn't have it before and they didn't think they could and they thought if they did it probably would come in uneducated form exact probably be some idiots or saying stupid things that don't even ring true but instead there's intelligent people and they're like fuck this you're like whoa hold on yeah like these people are actually articulate they look like they went to school like this is this is you know this is a new thing I actually think that it's a perfect example of the free market deciding because I don't think that the American people are stupid I think that they can decide and determine whether or not someone is intelligent enough or credible enough to cover a particular story so a perfect example of that is I'm not a science reporter so whenever I attempt to cover science news the audience tears me apart for it as they should because that's not my expertise my expertise is political commentary social commentary and that's usually the stuff that does really well on The Young Turks when I cover it and so the audience decides and they will let you know with mainstream media it's really difficult for you to voice your opinion if you don't like the coverage right you might write an email but you don't know if anyone's ever gonna see it with our show we're on YouTube we get constant constant feedback and a lot of times it's not constructive but but sometimes it is constructive like how you said it like that that might be the lowest form of human on the planet is the YouTube commenter there are some or D hideous people on there if you looked at it like two per numbers like per capita mm-hmm it's gotta be 40% assets okay so let me give you an example of something that enraged me the other day I literally lost it in our studio and everyone's like you need to calm down we covered this story about this guy in Massachusetts who was going around taking upskirt pictures with his cell phone okay so cops finally caught him back in 2010 and now he's gonna stand trial for it and he's actually suing the government because he feels that his First Amendment rights have been violated and his female lawyer is arguing that since these women are in a public place they have no reasonable expectation of privacy therefore he should be allowed to take upskirt pictures of them how absurd is that argument anyway we cover it on the show we share our you know opinion on it and I would say like about 1/3 of the audience was like yeah they're right yeah and as a dumb bitch what if she doesn't know anything First Amendment rights and it's like ah what am I supposed to do with these types of situations it's really frustrating that's like some trader shit right there yeah I would be very curious to see if she would be ok with this dude with her own client taking upskirt pictures with her or of her and another argument she made was what I mean all these women were wearing underwear we didn't see their vag so it's ok wow that's very gangster fur that's is that just what happens when you get into the business world you get into the corporate world and you know you become a lawyer and you're just it's about winning and losing and definitely going on the client and just yeah argue it even though you're sold your own vagina hold their own vagina I don't know what she looks like but maybe she has nothing to worry about maybe no one wants to get an upskirt picture of her and that's why she has no problem making these arguments in court or maybe she's just dying for someone to get a picture of yeah it's oh that's a fucking big leap that those women lawyers made they just decided I'm fucking straight to hell I was really surprised by that but you know look when you have there's like financial gain involved then okay I guess I can kind of understand where you're coming from your lawyer and you're trying to make some money I guess and it's really difficult for lawyers right now to even get cases to get work so maybe that plays a role in it but what really bothered me about it is we have a progressive audience like our audience is pretty liberal so whenever I see that kind of response to a story like that I'm always shocked I'm like wait you guys are ok with this it's just men man who most men who are raised by shitheads that's a lot of it it's a big part of it real problem is they don't even realize they're being shitheads because if dad was a shithead their brothers a shithead they grow up in a community of shitheads it's just behavior and there's also a possibility that they're just straight out trolling like they don't even believe what they're saying but they're doing it to get a response like this I just won they just won and I'm totally aware of that but I just yeah I remember being in the studio like reading the comments it was like what fuck why what am I doing with my life it doesn't matter doesn't you know and I started feeling really bad about it but then I was like you just can't let that stuff get to you you got to take it with a grain of salt yeah you can get caught up in an online troll war you you guys actually made fun of me the Young Turks did because I got in an online myspace thing I don't even remember is a long time ago but he was right I would have made fun of me if I was me I shouldn't had this interaction with this kid this kid that kept harassing me over and over again it was during the myspace days and you know no one knew like how to handle that yeah it was like the new thing if someone could just contact people yep and so some people would just contact people and go why haven't you not killed yourself you know just and you would get an email from someone saying you know you're horrible you should you know you should eat glass you know whatever you get like a lot of those in a day like what the fuck like this is weird this is a new thing interesting I get dick pics regularly really regularly geotag them and you should put them reupload on my line let everybody know where that sweet dick is I've considered that but you know a lot of times they'll send me the pictures on facebook because I have a fan page on Facebook and every once in a while check the messages and they're so stupid because all of their private information is on there like where they work who their girlfriend or their wife is and part of me wants to like forward it over to their girlfriend or wife but I'm too nice like I don't want it like ruin their lives over there like perverted behavior that's very kind of you do that didn't a guy recently lose his job because they found out he was yeah he was a reddit troll it was like would do evil evil shit on reddit and some people said all right who is this guy yeah and then they found you know who this guy was and was a character that he was playing like to blow off steam yeah yeah he would just be like really evil and nasty online a small part of me felt kind of bad for him cuz he had a family to take care of and you know it's gonna like destroy his life and I get it online anonymity allows people to blow off steam in that way and a lot of people right now because of the economic crisis because of all the crap that's going on in the government all the death and destruction that's around us constantly a lot of people need some sort of outlet and so they will use online anonymity to do that to say hideous things to other people because that makes them feel good about themselves and I think that if you're a mature adult you can just ignore them and step away I'm not interested in censoring them I know that YouTube is trying to like you know work with their comments so those negative comments get pushed back to the bottom or whatever and and no one can read them I just feel like you know the Internet should be an open forum for the most hateful people if they want to be hateful and we as adults have to have thicker skin and just walk away and not let it get get to us and it's hard to do it still gets to me I mean that's what I opened the show with you know I like the way you two handles it if too many people say this comments retarded then they eliminate it but you can always see it if you wanted to like show the comment yeah you could still show the comment and they're they're slowly getting rid of anonymity where they're you know attaching the comments to a Google+ account so it'll be easier to identify who that person is I'm not necessarily against that I just feel like you know I don't want to move closer toward censorship online I love that it's an open forum even though there are negative aspects to it that impact my life yeah no I agree with you I think it's it's an important like method of criticism that was never available for we have a very honest view of like what you do and what people like what you when they like what you do when they don't in even if it's like really a hyper critical / critical if they have a point like that point probably would have never gotten to you during any other era and like if you want to like really analyze what you're doing and try to figure out like what's the best way to hone this and they'll give you a lot of input they definitely well I will say that my political views of significantly since I started working at TYT and it's not necessarily because of my colleagues it has a lot to do with audience feedback for instance you know what I thought about prostitution when I first started was very different from what I think now I was definitely against legalizing prostitution I was in favor of tough on crime legislation when it came to dealing with that and then I realized like this is stupid it's not keeping anyone safe people are getting hurt as a result of you know pushing this ban against prostitution so I've changed my views on that I think that we should legalize it and regulate it because that'll create a safe environment and that's just one example of many will Edie from the ghetto boys that I post I mean if you have two consenting adults wanting to do that exchange money for sex why the hell not it's amazing that we have like this huge porn industry in the country and as long as they do it in front of a camera it's totally fine yeah but if they do it behind the scenes it's illegal well it's also weird that you can have sex with anybody you want for free and yeah I think there's no crime committed at all but if money is exchanged somehow you become a criminal both parties does anyone really have sex for free though I think yeah this is people that yeah there's people where it evens out where it's free on both sides no no but what I mean by that is usually there's something else involved I'm not talking about money right but there are emotions involved there's an exchange of emotions there's an exchange of something it's loads fluids yeah well you know there's obviously there's massive issues with men versus women as far as how they emotionally connect to sex mm-hmm and also the the need like what I don't know what it's like to need sex as a woman I'm sure it's a very specific itch whereas with a male I'm pretty sure after all my years of observing men and women in the different that it's a different animal I think horny is for a man is very intoxicating and fogging and confusing and I don't know if it is for women I think that's why like a lot of women like a few cocktails first they can light up the crazy furnace without I think the cocktails I think men and women have similar sexual desires however women are not allowed to be as open about it because of societal expectations and certain gender roles if you are a woman who is open about how much you love sex and how often you want to have sex and how badly you need it you are looked at as a ho there's no question about it people will refer to you as a loose woman a slutty woman that's the reason why a lot of women like to have the cocktails before they have sex because that'll allow them to let loose and do what they really want to do right you know without feeling guilty about it at least that's my my take and then also if you don't have sex if you decide to save yourself for marriage or are you safe save yourself for someone that you genuinely love or whatever then you're considered a prude there's really no winning yeah women have a total short end of the stick society and Society wise when it comes to sex without a doubt but I think that if you wanted to say like who's gonna think that you're a ho for enjoying sex well it's definitely gonna be women it's gonna be a lot of women that seems you're home and it's definitely gonna be guys who you won't have sex with so what's left you only left with like two groups of guys there's guys that would have zero problem with it at all and then there's guys that would only have a problem with it if you weren't attracted to them that's you know and most like see it weeds out assholes so if you were a chick and you just like listen I'm a freak I like to get fucked all day long that's what I'm into you'll find exactly the right people you need in your life that's an interesting perspective girls won't have anything to do with you I know but you'll also attract a lot of really scary pervy people oh no doubt instantly instantly because I think I think for a lot of people especially in the culture we're living right now if you're that open about your sexual desires you know people will see that as a green light to do things that might even be considered illegal you know whether it's harassment or sexual assault or something that's true and also I mean this is like probably bullshit but I would I would imagine that if if you're the type of person that starts getting into like threesomes and tying each other up and you start getting like really freaky it's way easy to go too far with that it's way like if you hear about someone like I'm just into sex all day long I just love sex is it just sex or how long does it take for a ball gag comes out yeah is it a month in your relationship you know like a year later what are you gonna be into a year from now just duct tape dude I like ripping it off of her and you know there's people that get in like how does that happen they they go down one of those pervy roads yeah no you just got deep yeah go down pervy road you just can't get satisfied it's like people have this weird thing of constantly want wanting progress if they have a house that's 4,000 square feet they want a house it's 5,000 square feet they make half a billion dollars a year they want to make a million dollars a year they always want to take things to the next level and then include like freaky shit well that's the American Way you always want more more you want the bigger TV and even I'm definitely guilty of that you know I live in a really modest apartment that I love but the other day I was like you know I could probably go for a bigger apartment well why I live by myself my apartments fine I don't need a bigger one right when it comes to you know physical stuff I think you kind of just get desensitized by things you know there have been many studies about what porn does to the brain and you start off by watching something that might be considered softcore and that's enough to you know do the job and then all of a sudden you're watching more and more hardcore stuff and you just become desensitized to it and for a lot of teenage boys that grow up on that kind of stuff that's what they expect from women you know or girls once they start having sex it's really scary stuff and it's changing people's sexuality without a doubt Bush is gone the bush died because of porn I heard that you're upset about that I'm terrified you they let porn win it just doesn't make sense it's like everybody let porn went before nobody had a problem until like 1990 nobody had a problem with a hairy vagina just what it was I mean people trimmed around him but generally there was a lot going on down there especially if he dated an Italian girl what have you but now it's like their victory is just universal it's like the victory over that aesthetic the victory over their shaved you know waxed well those women are supposed to symbolize male desire they're supposed to symbolize what a man wants you know and then that has an influence on regular women and they think Oh am I supposed to look that way am I supposed to groom that way there have been stories of women that injure themselves because they'll go get bleached in areas that they shouldn't be getting bleached and it's just amazing to me that it's that influential I know it's very strange it's it's a silent influential thing it is it's very odd and I was when when the markets are crashing and government bailouts were going down I was fascinating it was like how come nobody ever wanted to bail out the porn industry like why would they pretend that the porn industry isn't this giant monster business that all the sudden just evaporated like half of it what three-quarters of it I don't know what the number of it that just disappeared yeah cuz of the internet right so like who's pretending that this isn't a real business like everyone's like well I guess they'll just have to exist on their own I mean while you're watching it like that person is a fan of it he probably has like a bunch of different videos that he has like bookmarked on his laptop or something yeah definitely but at the same time which politician would come out and say we need to bail out the porn industry that would be political suicide we live in this puritanical society I mean that would be insane there's also the same sort of feeling that happened with the music business is that you know what the music business went out as well with the downloads of mp3s and file-sharing they lost a giant piece of revenue and it just evaporated and no one really was considering bailing them out either it's like it was like you know you kind of should have figured this out dummies yeah well I agree with you on that but at the same time everything always goes back to who is funding our politicians you know Wall Street these big bankers these are the people that fund the campaigns for our politicians which is why they just willy-nilly went for the bailout and by the way after the bailout happened we did nothing to break up these too-big-to-fail banks still exist and they're still doing the same type of bullshit that'll lead to another economic collapse I mean the regulation that we passed was nothing so it's just it always goes back to money in politics which you know we talk about on the show all the time if someone is funding you whether it's the media or whether you're a politician you're not gonna go against them you're always gonna bail them out yeah turns McKenna described it as a he described it he described it as a special interest oligarchy disguising itself as a democracy oh yeah we have legalized bribery in this country it's amazing yeah isn't it I mean when you really stop and think that that is it's gotten to the point that it is today where essentially it's open it's pretty obvious it's there they control virtually every single aspect of our economy our society it's all just money generating hubs these big giant spaceships filled with assholes that are just sucking money out of whatever whether it's through oil or natural gas or whatever they're doing why do why do all subsidies exist like good question why don't people ask the government that like why the hell are we giving these massive profitable oil companies subsidies it's in saying at the same time we're cutting funding for education we're privatizing public schools which is the complete and utter disaster subsidy sounds like they should get it it's like there's oil subsidies oh okay all subsidies you know it's not like oil donations or a little oil paola if they call it oil paola wait a minute what is that yeah you why do they get law don't they have a lot of money yeah what's happening here most profitable industry in the United States in the world you know so it's it's frustrating stuff but fortunately you know there are ways around it citizens united was a terrible Supreme Court ruling you know which effectively allows corporations to act as people and make these unlimited campaign donations to politicians so one way that you can get around that is by creating a constitutional amendment which we're trying to do at the young turks there's a political action committee that we formed called Wolfpack your audience can learn more about it at wolf dash pack.com and basic it would have state leaders propose a resolution and the resolution would create a constitutional convention where you can make an amendment to the Constitution that would get money out of politics and that would fix so many problems because then our broken democracy would change into a system that it was intended to be where our elected politicians are supposed to represent us the people instead of corporations well when you back something in the corner and shine a light on it you really get to know its true nature yeah and if that ever does come to play it would be a very fascinating moment to see how the system that's in place today would deal with the idea of taking money out of politics and what kind of a scramble would take place yeah that would be it would be quite weird to see it would be it's I'm not gonna lie it's definitely gonna be difficult to do I you know Jane cougar is really optimistic about it I'm not as optimistic as he is but I think that if if the American people become a little more politically active and they sign the petitions necessary and they hold their state representatives accountable I think that this could happen you know it just takes a little bit of political activism and unfortunately there's this huge level of apathy right now which I don't understand because the political climate is leading to you know this economic meltdown and all of the problems that people are experiencing right now income inequality wealth inequality it's scary stuff I mean we lie to ourselves when we say that we live in the best country in the world we have legalized bribery we need to fix it we need to fix our democratic process when when you look at the future of this country the way it's running the way it is currently operated how long can that it seems like it's falling apart at the wheels it seems like it's like this crazy thing that's spinning and shaking and sucking money out and freaking out how long can this thing operate the way it is right now I'm not sure I mean that's a really good question but people are really starting to feel you know the the downfall of how our system is working like just to give you an example this number blows my mind the top 10 percent in this country owns 75% of the wealth that is bananas so how money that's a lot of money ballers and 10% ballers everyone else is struggling they're struggling top 1% owns one-third of the wealth in the country and so people are struggling to make ends meet and the reason why that's happening is because we're seeing these huge tax cuts for the most wealthiest people you know why is it that we're supposed to have the highest corporate tax rate but when because of corporate loopholes we actually have the lowest corporate tax rate I mean we got to get rid of those loopholes and then you have the Republicans saying yeah you know what we should raise taxes one way we can do that is by getting rid of deductions which deduction do they want to go after homeowners they want to go after people who get that interest rate deduction in their taxes and that of course impacts the middle class so it's just there's just a lot of frustrating stuff going on it seems like there's two bunch of stuff going on for everybody to pay attention to everything that's one of the reasons where the apathy comes in it's just too freaky there's too much happening it's too nutty it's not gonna get fixed shit close the shade I'm gonna take a nap I'm gonna watch the Kardashians or you know play video games or do whatever I need to do to distract myself and I don't blame people for doing that a lot of these issues are really complicated and complex you know you have to sit down and do so much research we have this mainstream media that's also broken they're not reporting the real news you know you have to really depend on independent media to get real facts and so I don't blame people for wanting to be distracted but at the same time if we allow things to continue the way they are we're gonna have the wealthiest people living in their castles with moats around them while we're gonna struggle to find private security because everything that is publicly funded is going to be defunded including our education we're seeing that happen now nobody ever wants to think that the operating system that we have that runs our society could fall apart nobody ever wants to think that all of a sudden there would be no cops because they don't get paid it has happened in places like Camden New Jersey yep perfect example enough cops it's insane and of course I mean it's common sense their crime rate shot up as a result of that of course it was a free ride yep I mean that that's if you were like a really bad person does like the best place to move in the country like look there's no cops they don't even have them yeah that's a small little crumbling and the foundation of our society just a little one and you know maybe they fixed it for now but eventually that could happen there was an Anthony Bourdain special I was watching today yeah he's great his new show for the CNN show he was in Detroit and he was just going over these factories where they used to make these amazing cars and now they're just completely falling apart and it's it's freaky it's freaky to see how this city of two million plus people now is like less than 700,000 and you could buy a house for like five hundred bucks and he was like touring around the city and checking it out and I was that if that can happen that quickly yep that's just one city that can happen other places too like this whole thing is like barely hanging together with chewing gum and I think the most frustrating part about that is you know we have politicians that will pass policies that lead to the collapse of certain cities California is in a lot of trouble right now because of a proposition we passed in 1978 called proposition 13 it capped property taxes at 1.2 percent and as a result we started defunding our education which is why the LAUSD went from being one of the best school districts in the country to being one of the worst school districts in the country and we just lost out on a ton of revenue as a result of our low very low property taxes and so they'll pass policies like that in the case of California of course Californians voted for it which was disastrous but then at the same time they'll cut government programs that will help the poorest people whether it's the SNAP program or the food stamp program or you know the welfare programs rather that help needy kids and it's like look if you don't want to spend as much money on governmental programs or social programs then stop passing policies and tax cuts that make it really really difficult for people to make ends meet well I think if it wasn't for shows like yours and people like you and jank or exposing this stuff and people in the new media people that are writing these very very popular blogs if it wasn't for that yeah this information wouldn't be going out if the information wasn't going out people wouldn't realize what a clusterfuck it really yes they would tune into the nightly news and get this sense that everything's gonna be okay which is basically what America did until the internet came around yeah definitely it seems like within the ten fifteen plus years of the active internet the whole world has just stopped and went wait what the fuck are we doing like everyone shaking their head looking left and right confusion turmoil and questioning on a level that I don't think we've seen before and this weird new thing where anybody can just stick a camera and attach it you know USB it to a laptop and boom you're online I know making YouTube videos or making mp3s it's incredible it's a weird weird time it gets me really excited like just thinking about it because the possibilities are endless and I mean we had the Young Turks we had no marketing budget we had no publicity we had nothing all we did was create a business model that worked Jake does the really serious political reporting which I'm jealous of that's what I wanted to do and then I come in and I do the stuff that goes viral online why would you be jealous of paying attention to this system I love really I love politics I and don't get me wrong you marry it maybe I will know that I love I mean I studied political science for my masters and it's just always been a passion of mine since I was in high school so even though things are really bad right now I have this passion to try to make a difference and so I see Jenk making a difference and I'm really proud of him and he's someone that's been my mentor someone that I look up to and you know I want to be able to analyze politics as well as he does at the same time you know I was brought in for something completely different I was brought in to make the company money and that's basically what I do the stories that I cover in my hour of the show are sometimes very important social stories you know whether it's gay rights women's rights whatever you know men's rights when it comes to how they get screwed over you know when it comes to children and marriage and basically the law men men are basically screwed over when it comes to sexual harassment and stuff but women aren't like it's amazing but that's a side note but then you know I'll do the stories that are really stupid but people love them like will do a Miley Cyrus story and it'll get like millions of views and will make a ton of money off that video but there's no value to that story so I always feel guilty doing it so I'll have I'll have days where I'm just like yeah I'm I'm a big failure I think this is what I do for my life and I feel guilty about it I I see what you saying but at the same time following politics is like following some fucking fake minstrel show yeah it's fake it's discouraging there's no question I mean it's like I I was fuck I had this conversation with Jamie kill steam on some dude from citizen radio I knew what they were talking about politics oh I know do you ever think that by following this fake horse and pony show that you're like you know like lending credence to it because you're an intelligent person you're pretending this isn't all just assholes who are getting bribed because that's what it really is yeah it's really just a bunch of assholes that are getting bribed and they're the ones and they're cronyism and all this weird shit going on with laws and yes they Kenny can't get away with and what they can and can't get charged with well I mean look there's there's a huge difference between political reporters in the mainstream that just report on it but they don't really give a shit about making a difference and then there's a huge difference between people like Jamie and Alison on citizen radio or the Young Turks or any other you know pull what is it called aa name just lost me Alex Jones no we're coming at you with YouTube views info wars.com the number one media source in the nation young turks tries to pretend they have similar ratings friend of mine is yeah he's crazy yeah he's mine i I have no problem it's a great guy though I love him if you met him he's a sweetheart shank did meet him and he ended up liking it so I believe it I believe it but his response video to us was hilarious on so many different levels like put a shirt on dude put a fucking shirt on like if you're trying to make a decent point and you don't want to seem like you're loony what a fucker ah but don't if you're Alex Jones you a fucking shirt probably naked most likely his website no one's gonna care period globally even Rolling Stone New York magazine all the actuaries he's number one period yeah by the way here's one thing he's missing it's a shirt [Laughter] he's crazy I've known Alex for a long time I did a DVD in 1999 and he and I put on Bush masks I was a bush junior and he was Bush Senior and we put on these masks we ran around the Austin State Capitol like the front yard like and filmed it when Bush got elected and the title the DVD was belly of the beast so I was like it was right when Bush was getting elected we decided to do this in Austin and he him and me are in this this video and he's singing a song he sings this like crazy New World Order's song he wrote oh that's that's not us that's a different one the other one we were actually wearing these masks but I've known him forever he's a really good guy I don't I don't you know deny that I'm sure he is a good guy I don't tell me the truth is he like playing a role when he's on camera because I don't believe that he's really that crazy like some of the stuff he says I just don't believe he believes I I do not know I would not pretend to know I think he's a very complex man I think there's a lot going on beneath the surface there's a lot of layers to that cake and I think that a lot of people look at me think he's a screaming maniac but he was right about a lot of shit a long time ago he was saying that the NSA is gonna be reading all your emails and looking through you he said they're they're gonna make deals with major data networks with AT&T and Google he was saying this a long time ago and I specifically remember having conversations with a friend and he and my friend was like that is so crazy why would they do that they're not gonna do that do you do you really think that the law would ever let them do that blah blah I own the law get fucking crazy and they'll go Alex Jones iyanya but you know here's the thing that strategy or that delivery is effective because there have been people who have been reporting about you know civil liberties violations for a while and they get no attention so sometimes the squeaky wheel will get the attention and you know if if that's what he needs to do to get coverage of those important news stories that's totally fine the thing is you know there there are little sprinkles of truth to some of the stuff through reports and then some of the stuff that he reports is just crazy and it's made up you know so it's like I I don't know where to fall with that guy because I want to support him with some stories but then other stories I'm like dude you need to tone it down well I don't know what the process is for acquiring information vetting it out and then publishing it yelling at the YouTube channel I don't know what it what the process says but I know that he's right about a lot of things and I know that he's passionate about a lot of things but I think that he probably needs a better filter yeah you know I think there's a few rats he'll go on well you're like wait a minute chemtrails do you understand how many planes are in the sky every night Brian chemtrails blocking out the Sun I can't even fucking grow tomatoes here in Austin Texas no you're amazing I've been hanging out with more than a decade that's uncanny that's insane but he he'll go off about something and then you go but did you know that this and that and that you know like you'll you'll have counters to those but those don't get in there yeah those don't get in there they get New World Order doubt if they get black collar copter doubt yeah yes ricochet off he wants to see a conspiracy and every fucking thing that's ever existed ever if you come up to him about whatever it is name it JFK the iran-contra whitewater death of Vince Foster so there's a there's a million stories they never end he'll just fucking come at you but he's been right about a lot of stuff that's really freaky one thing that he reported on that very you people caught was the use of paid police officers to pretend to be people that are in a crowd protesting and then agent provocateurs and they would start smashing things he covered this in Seattle when the World Trade Organization was making their who believed it was the 90s when they were there was these massive protests and the protests went violent well he he has all these photos of like the bottom of their boots military-issue Vibrams and like points all is like these are police officers they're wearing masks no one else is and they're the only ones doing any damage they're smashing things and they're doing it so then the police can come in and start arresting peaceful people which they normally couldn't do and I thought that was the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life the crazy thing is you know when it came to the Occupy protesters that they weren't even agent provocateurs they were just cops like breaking shit and starting the violence and you know they got a little bit of criticism for it but the media would pick up the story and make it seem as though the Occupy protesters were the violent they would do everything necessary to discredit them which made me so angry because finally in this country there was a little bit of political activism they changed the conversation because we were talking about bullshit until occupy came along and talked about wealth inequality and then you know you have the mainstream that totally discredited them and then they just kind of fizzled out and I had so much hope for that movement I know what fucked that movement I'm not being organized soap soap soap didn't get enough there's too many stinky motherfuckers out there and drum circles I kinda I was a big part of it I caught I covered occupy LA and occupy Oakland occupy Oakland was a scary situation to cover because there they were a lot more militant there I mean their intentions were in the right place but their delivery was a little scary so I just kind of felt like shit could hit the fan yeah like one wrong move and violence could break out but but they they it was because they were overly protective they knew what was happening to other protesters you know look at what happened at UC Davis I think you know with that cops bringing that pepper spray on those students that are just sitting there so I think that they were just overly protective as they should have been because of the treatment that all these protesters were dealing with and the treatment throughout history I mean all they have to do is go back and to look at what was going on during the Vietnam War look at what happened at Kent State when they started shooting then the arm the National Guard is shooting at students that were protesting me that that's not that long ago people are aware that kind of stuff but when I saw this Alex Jones thing I really thought it was the dumbest thing I've ever seen it was like there's no way that could ever be possible there's no way cut and then he presents it like very clearly very cleanly over and over again all the different news stories that pointed to different various incidents that took place including them sequester they got all of the agent provocateurs in a house the cops negotiated with them and then let them go I mean the whole thing was like so cut and dry and clear when you have evidence backing up you know your belief that something is a conspiracy then of course I mean you have strong evidence and all believe it but it's one thing to have the evidence it's another thing to purport that something is going on and then not having the evidence to that's why I said I think he needs a filter mm-hmm I think she's got a lot of his heart and his intentions are in the right place and the dude will go to war like he'll fucking go to sleep Zach took it out in the street with somebody he's fucking crazy I know ants yeah he's a madman but he's also a good guy like I just think that he needs a filter yeah I said but he's right more than he's wrong I'll tell you that especially now that's his Alex at me and that's that's Alex on the left and me on the right and this is his song this that's Alex singing that's my buddy he is hang out with ya he's very fun to hang out with he's great to drink beers with ya he's a good dude he's funny he says a lot of really funny shit uh-huh he's a good guy he's a sweetheart he really is so did he ever talk to you about why he got on us about like views I don't ask him any questions about things like that he's been in some disputes with friends of mine disputes welcome to oh it's just Alex man you're gonna have to deal with that on your own like I say he's a good guy yes he wants a better America he really does he's not a greedy guy he's not a guy who's in it for the money give you the shirt off yeah using stamps.com he he really is like the real deal like he really wants a better America he really wants to get out all the corruption the scum but he believes that the global elites are trying to live to be a thousand years old what they're doing right now with stem cells the reason why the Bush administration just like how did you meet him how did that happen I met him in Texas through a friend of mine friends with him I knew him from his radio day well he still has a radio show but now it's more internet-based but he had a radio show I think his radio show is still pretty popular though unlike those dudes that have those fucking those ham radios yeah yeah tune in Altoona Alex Jones they fucking just thinking that that's this is not thinking that the only problem with that is there's that thinking that goes along with that which is like collect gold like dig a hole in the ground for a nuclear shelter like Preppers and people start putting battering rams in their pickup trucks crazy I don't think that's the way to do it I don't want to live my life like that where you're constantly paranoid and you're worried about doomsday there look there's some really scary shit happening in the government right now I know I will not take away from that but I I don't believe in the Doomsday Preppers like they need to calm down their paranoia is misplaced unless something happens like what happened two days ago in the Philippines yes yeah that's that's the real issue yeah maybe nature much nature is the issue and we keep fuckin with her so yeah allegedly allegedly because you know not enough scientists agree on you know well there's plenty of scientists use me there's plenty of scientists that disagree mm-hmm they also all happen to be working for oil come exactly companies I mean the Koch brothers will fund scientists to put out studies that claim that either climate change does not exist this is just a normal trend that we were experiencing with our planet or that it exists but it's not you know created by humans well they went way back to the 1950s they were doing that with cigarettes when people were trying to come out saying hey I think these things are giving us cancer they fucking funded a shitload of studies and they're like now look we can find certain things we were talking about on the podcast yesterday worth nicotine actually can be a medicine in certain circumstances I think you help people with heart issues and ADHD issues and all these different things so like you could find a way to rationalize if you were a real piece of shit that like you should probably smoke cigarettes yeah you won't get ADHD yeah I mean it's just like another example of money influencing you know the behavior of Americans and and the information that gets put out there yeah I were talking earlier about being addicted to items and being addicted to things and how you wanted to get a bigger apartment even though you don't need it I'm guilty as charged too but I think about it all the time and what I'm starting to believe is that human beings like the reason why we we like to think of ourselves as being something that we're much more in control of than just the woes of nature but I kind of think that more more likely than that everything is natural and even though we break down like ant behavior as being natural and wolf behaviors being natural but humans well you know we have freewill and we have education and we have maybe but when I look at like the trend like where it is right now let's I don't know how it got here but let's pretend it's all nature what is it doing well what it's doing is it's making things it's making crazier and crazier things every day the whole race is working together and one of the ways it ensures people consistently technologically innovate is by making it attractive to have the newest latest shit yeah and everybody wants it like who that new Lexus look at that commercial oh my god I gotta have it and it's a fucking new laptop and it's a new phone and it's a new earpiece I mean it's also it's also a status thing it's a status symbol to have the latest and greatest no doubt we recently covered this story about Barneys I don't know if you talked about it at all in your show but there was this young black man who went into a Barneys he purchased a $350 belt with a debit card and allegedly the cashier called the authorities on him because she didn't believe that a black guy can afford this $350 belt so the cops came they started questioning him they said we know we need proof indicating that that's your debit card he had to call chase and prove like yes that is his debit card you know they like detained him for a little while and then finally they let him go so he's suing Barneys now for racial profiling so we'll see how that case plays out but you know aside from the racial profiling component of that story I was just shocked that I think he's 19 that a 19 year old would save up multiple paychecks by the way to pot to buy a $350 belt and it's like it goes against everything I believe I hate that kind of materialism and I'm not he's a victim here so I'm not trying to criticize him it's more of a societal thing where we all want to show off our new shiny handbag and it's fucking bullshit I hate when women fall for that crap when they work multiple months just to afford like a $2,500 handbag and it's like who are you trying to prove like what are you trying to prove and who are you trying to prove it to you're trying to show off to other women right which by the way if you're like a real woman I think that you shouldn't get jealous by that kind of crap you know and if you're real woman well you said like a real man no I have I have this as I get older I mean I'm I'm getting obsessed with a person's character and I'm I care less and less about the bullshit that doesn't matter so when I was younger you know I got brainwashed into thinking hey you know what you need to make sure that you marry who's like really established in his career because you want to make sure you can take care of you fuck that I want to take care of myself like I don't need a guy to take care of me and that's not to say that I I don't want a man in my life I definitely do I want a partner in my life and I want it to be like a real partnership where we help each other out but at the same time like this obsession with materialism makes me sick to my stomach it's distracting and it makes people feel that if they can't afford certain things then they're not good enough that they're not worthy if they don't have the money to shop at Barney's then they're less than why I definitely think you're right from a sociological aspect aspect I feel like the the whole desire is fruitless and silly and weird and it exists more with people that can't have it and want it very badly but there's a lot of people that are rich that just go shopping every day and but it's just the whole never gets filled yeah it's always it's never like the big rush that you get at least if you're poor and you buy a $2,000 watch or like holy shit and you look at that can't believe I got it whoo but if you're really wealthy if you're some billionaire character there's nothing to nothing it doesn't even register it's like a dull thumping on your helmet it never really gets to skin I just I don't like making people feel like they are worthless because they can't afford them I mean who makes you them feel like that is it isn't it on them and it whatever person sure I mean look listen to pop culture listen to all the rap songs and all that oh you know I got my new Cadillac or whatever they brag about that good car I'll get me wrong whatever whatever I got my Maybach right yes right they rap about that shit who cares about your Maybach you know like I don't know why people are so obsessed with that and then these young kids think oh my god I got to work really hard for that Maybach which is why so many people get involved in the financial sector and they sell their souls because they just want to be rich and we need people who want to be teachers you know I'll be it most of them get screwed over with really really crappy salaries and we should definitely pay our teachers better but people don't gravitate toward jobs that actually help the community because they're so obsessed with making money and I hate seeing our brightest students go toward the financial sector instead you know focusing on jobs that do help the community whether it's you know in in fields that lead to technological innovation or to medical innovation and of course doctors make a lot of money but you know a lot of scientists that do some serious research that really benefits society don't make a lot of money it's true and so I I just hate the incentive structure that we have these days and this emphasis on always having the the newest most expensive item available yeah it's definitely ridiculous but as a person trying make an attempt to look at it objectively if I was like an alien species coming down to observe earth I would say they're in a mad scramble to create the next technological marvel they're in a mad scramble to create the the new internet the next thing and they're gonna go from that to the next thing they're transforming themselves they're essentially it's a long-term cocoon that turns a caterpillar into a butterfly it's just taking a few hundred years but technologically there's some sort of a symbiotic relationship that we have with with technology and that's fueled by materialism yes materialism drive it ensures that people consistently buy the newest things innovate and constantly trying to express with the latest is sociologically I agree with you 100% yeah but I think that there's there's probably something more going on yeah we're just not aware of because we're like trapped in the middle of the hurricane of it all yeah I think you make a really good point about you know gadgets and technology I guess what I'm more focused on is just like the designer bullshit that we buy into that kind of stuff really frustrates I just think it's a side shoot of the same issue the money thing - I think about that like the this desire to pursue massive amounts of money and change what is that all really doing I mean if it's all just a pool of money and everybody's trying to you know keep it moving and keep it active what does it really do well it buys things and if it's buying things someone's making things someone's making things are gonna keep improving those things cuz everybody wants to do its thing it's basically the same engine this innovation engine that's like pushing forward and we're all trapped up in it in like as calling it culture and calling it all these other different things Budda Budda really is is a mad scramble to make new technology so what's your what's your guilty pleasure like what do you like to splurge on even though you might feel okay really yeah does that get expensive yeah they get expensive yeah yeah well I'm there's an art form to making pool cues mm-hmm believe it or not and I play a lot of pool and I used to play I was obsessed I used to play 810 hours a day when I lived in New York I was it was two point yeah when my manager was telling me it was it was affecting my career it was because I was paying more attention to playing pool than I was to comedy yeah I was I was completely obsessed but there's not that many pool cue manufacturers makers the but the artisans the real handmade ones like there's a guy named Zambo de berry Zamboni who's like world-famous his dad was Gus tam bodis like one of the original pool cue makers like that name has like a lot of weight to and these cues are like this artistic functional art that you could play pool with but they're also like really beautiful I'm fascinated by them my friend created my friend Eric has a company called sugar tree and he makes these beautiful cues all based on woods they're like really exotic and strange burls and and weird like figure in the wood and he's just obsessed with wood and because like you get like you you when you buy when it was cute you probably went a minute you could like literally see the passion than it took that this guy made this guy who's obsessed with wood you know he's obsessed with different grains and tonal qualities and Ageing them and it's this real artistic expression and it just it's a functional piece of art I'm obsessed with them so yeah there's nothing wrong with that that's very like obscure and like I've never heard anyone talk about pool cues like yeah that's my guy with a big cabinet full of them that's my guilty pleasure nice yeah I just love to play pool nice it's a stupid thing to do it doesn't matter whether the ball goes in the hole but it does matter everything matters if that's what you find pleasurable and you know it helps you blow off steam or whatever go for it there's nothing wrong with that I think there's a microcosm to life in it I think there's a thing about pool see these are these are handcrafted pool cues yeah I think some of them can cost several thousand dollars Wow those ones you're looking at those are probably two or three thousand at least that's really pretty yeah and they get real intricate there's different ways they splice them together like you see those things that at the end like those are those little things inside of them are little inlays and as you get further out those are different pieces of wood they're spliced and together that's in cotton glued in place and then spun on a lathe and there are you know exotic woods like that's evany and you could see all these different inlays some of them were probably made out of ivory and silver and all these they're they used to it used to be legal to buy ivory to to make pool cues with it used to make the balls out of ivory and then people realize what a piece of shit you have to be to kill an elephant so they cut that off but there's so much ivory left over it's really kind of sad there's so much left over from when they were just slaughtering elephants before they started regulating it that you can get ivory to make inlays and stuff and pool cues it's everywhere so it becomes like a real issue like a moral issue you have to think like wow is that kind of fucked up but then it's like well what do you what are they gonna do with the the animals like been dead since 1970 and they have these tusks are you just gonna let them go to waste or is it better to like put them in a museum where people can look at them like it's a it's kind of an interesting moral dilemma but my friend Erik uses he uses this fossilized Mastodon bone that he got yeah he uses like ten thousand year old fossilized walrus ivory that came from you know like they get his hands on that that's insane sisters an archaeologist Wow yeah I think it's a sister but yeah he's he's like really into me he doesn't use like that many he doesn't use like that many inlays his is all just about the wood like the quality of the wood I like that I like that that's really interesting I never I would have never guessed that they could get that expensive they all they get really expensive the old ones there's a man named Balabushka who lived in you know like then he the 1960s and 1970s I think he made cues and in the movie the color of money Paul Newman gave Tom Cruise of Balabushka and just by saying that name that those cue started being worth twenty-five thirty thousand dollars because there's a finite number of them there's a fact it's probably like the cue that has the most forgeries it's like Zamboni and Balabushka are the two a lot of fakes people like they you know they'll just knock it off and pretend it's one of them because you could sell it for twenty five thousand bucks your guilty pleasure is much better than mine it's just food food like I don't I can't really think of an object that I like to spend a lot of money on I just like to spend a lot of money on like a good experience like if I'm gonna travel or if I'm gonna eat at a nice restaurant I'm gonna go all out you know and not feel bad about it but that's pretty much it that just sounds like life I know a guilty pleasure I know I guess I'm trying to think I'm I'm a huge bargain shopper I don't really buy anything at full price I'm not really into that but you should say this interesting I am is this because of the way like your responsibility that you feel for looking at the world and seeing how fucked up things are that you feel bad spending a couple hundred bucks on a nice meal is that like what it is that like what it becomes a guilty pleasure because you're like fuck it I'm just gonna do it but normally yeah maybe maybe I think that there's something subconsciously that makes me feel guilty about it but I can't really put my finger on it I think it's because I know how hard I work and you know seeing all that money go toward one experience or one meal makes me feel a little bad but I actually what I like to do is if I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna spend some serious money I make sure that I take people with me and I spend the money on them as well because then I feel like I'm doing something good for my friends and I read the study about how the happiest people will actually spend money on others and it's totally true you feel really good when you take care of other people so you know I usually do that that's that's not my guilty pleasure that's the one thing that I will splurge on and I won't feel guilty about it I'll feel really good about it and then I hope you know one day when when my friends are in the mood like they'll take me out and they'll do hopefully one day you're waiting right I mean my friends I love my friends I'm in a really as someone in my age group I'm in a really great place financially because I lived at home for a long time I saved money I was with someone that I was going to buy a house with that didn't work out so now I just have money I'm not gonna put toward a house and I can do other things with it so I like to treat my friends to things once in a while you don't have to justify it yeah but it seems like a part of you because you're such a conscious and aware person realizes that you're in this rare circumstance yeah so it feels like a guilty pleasure I feel I don't know if it's guilt but I feel bad about a lot of things because I don't know I don't know white guilt is something I don't have especially because and by the way I love that accusation that we get from our audience to get time all the fucking time and it's so funny because like I'm Armenian like both my both my parents came from Armenia so they they didn't have like my ancestors didn't have slaves like they'd they try and tell me you know white I'm white but I'm not like I'm not American you know but I am American okay this is not sounding good whoa but like to say to say that I have white guilt would imply that I have ancestry that did hideous things to black people which is why I now want to raise awareness about issues of racism and that's not true I want to raise awareness about that is because I want genuine equality you know you see cases where racial profiling does exist no doubt and you want to you want to raise awareness about that because you want society to progress you don't want to pretend as though these societal ills don't exist they do exist but at the same time you don't want to demonize people either you don't want to make blanket statements about all white people that's insane yeah I've heard some pretty ridiculous blanket statements but what's what's really important is that the the idea of racism should be eventually it shouldn't exist anymore if one day it should come a time where that has been ironed out of the human culture where we've beaten it down it seems like if you go back to a few thousand years ago when they were burning people at the stake for various beliefs we've managed to get past that we've managed to get past killing neighbors you know the rival countries that were like a block away from each other in Europe we managed to get past all that I wonder if one day we're gonna get to a point where we don't give a fuck when anybody's races I wonder if there's going to be some economic evenness where it eventually all smooth out where it won't matter I wonder the same thing I'm not as optimistic about it though to be honest I'm pretty optimistic you are yeah I didn't used to be but as time has gone on the Internet is what makes me optimistic when I see like justice and and the voice of the Internet it seems to be a very ethical moral voice what do you think about you know some of the vigilante justice that you see online like in the case was the stupid Vil rape case and how anonymous you know kind of rallied behind that victim I thought that was really inspiring it's important yeah it's huge that that stuff has to happen I said it has to happen you can't let people do that because that could be your daughter that could be your friend that could be your mom that could be anybody you can't let that happen and they can't let that fucking happen either that the fact that they let that happen you got to clean that whole place out that's a disaster anybody who's involved in that what did you do what the fuck did you do you you just open the door for this kind of shit to be swept under the rug by future generations who find out about this as well this is like when when there's a gross injustice and it's and it doesn't get rectified there's there's this weird thing that happens where it can spawn more gross injustice yeah I mean it sets a precedent yeah and if one person can get away with doing that type of you know act or behaving in a certain way then other people will think like well I can do that I can get away with that and you know in the case of the Steubenville rape case I I was actually really shocked at how many people bullied the girl after she was raped and you see more and more stories like that popping up all over the place I think it's a human nature issue with a lot of young kids that have not been not only not have not been raised correctly but I think there's a lot of people that are just letting their kids raise themselves and they're not even having conversations with them and they're growing up with like animal instincts and animal instincts are that go after injured animals there's a weird thing it's scary it's a terrified thing especially when the injured animal is claiming that the alpha the social alphas have done this thing to them you know and then the social alphas is saying they didn't do it and then there's this weird sort of an appeasement thing going on where people are trying to gain a favor of the alphas by shitting on the victim it's terrifying stuff it's the worst aspects of humankind is this weird thing that we can have when we gang up you know and and the parents of the victim I give them all the credit in the world because I'm gonna be completely honest if I were in that position I don't know if I would be able to prevent myself from doing something that would that would lead me to getting prosecuted and thrown in jail yeah it's something happens to men that that get together and of a bunch of idiot men get together they think that that that's something that they can do and it's a and in the case of Steubenville they're boys they're teenagers and they think they can get away with it well it's just men period I mean young man old man there's a there's there's a man thing that can happen if there's too many dummies and they get together and they start thinking that they they're making sense or that they just focus fool could do this that's where like gang murders take place and gang beatings and you know I'm sure there's a similar sort of group mentality that happens with women but it doesn't seem to turn into as much of a victimization thing it can happen I've heard of like groups of women beating up other women I've heard that yeah you know if a girl like fuck some girl's husband or something like that and she'd get her friends and they'd all beat the shit out of the girl I've heard that kind of stuff happening she's scary scary stuff I've heard of stories of women raping men terrible we were talking about this on the podcast yesterday the problem with male rights organizations oh you guys must have gotten some serious hate for them no no no because I my point is always that yeah I mean there's a lot of dudes get fucked over to come to divorce laws a lot of the problem is when male rights advocates get disingenuous like they were talking about rape issues they were saying the number one group that gets raped in this country is men in prison the problem of that is of course that men are raping those men it's just it's more proof that men are cunts men are raping men it's this is a stupid argument it doesn't that's the worst thing you should ever say yeah you know just you're just saying that we're just rapers we're just we rape each other we don't give a fuck we'll rape anybody and that doesn't mean that men are victims if men are victims from men how does that support that the point that good point that's a really good what's a dumb point that there is a disingenuous thing that they're saying yeah like guys aren't really wondering around life worried about getting raped they worry about it if they get imprisoned I just worry that you know the men's rights movement is a response to like radical feminism and I have a lot of issues with radical feminism because when you pretend as though women are always the ones that get screwed over and men don't deal with certain double standards and certain issues then you're being disingenuous you know you're doing a disservice to your own movement I mean there are some serious issues with the way women are perceived in media for instance you know the way I'm perceived in the media is very different from how jenk is perceived in the media very different from how you're perceived in the media you know the comments that you will get usually will question the legitimacy or accuracy of something that you've said the comments that I get don't necessarily criticize the legitimacy of what I'm saying of course I get comments like that as well but how often you get comments about like oh you know I want I want Anna to sit on my face or I want Joe to sit on my face I get that once a month I stand corrected sure my man would even pretend I think that it's much more courageous I don't want some I come kissing your ass but it's much more courageous for a woman to do what you do than a man to do what you do for a man to do what you do it's like men with opinions are like is common as like birds that shit on cars yes they're everywhere this is man everybody look at man as an opinion but women with an opinion that go public and like have this like very strong stance they take on things and respect to be taken seriously it's like female stand-up comedians because female stand-up comedians they're so limited in topics because men don't want to hear you talk about politics men don't want to hear women talk about certain things yeah you know they're like anything where you're telling people how to live their lives but I don't want to hear that from women it's just a giant group of men just shut you off I'm much harder I think that you know younger generations are becoming way more open to that like we have a really young audience and for the most part I think that they're open to me talking about politics like I said I I don't get to do that as often as I would like on the show because that's not my role on the show but there is a huge chunk of our audience that's very open minded toward that however there's also a chunk of the audience and I'm just going based on what I've read on YouTube so there's a huge silence silent part of our audience that I never get to hear from but there is also a portion that just immediately sees me and thinks oh she's a young whatever relatively good-looking and so they immediately see a correlation there with moronic behavior like oh she's attractive she must be well you've had a free ride that's what they think oh yeah oh yeah really what is golden ticket you're pretty yeah yeah yeah so I'll get comments you know asking you know what kind of sexual favors I gave my male colleagues to get to the position that I'm in how rude and it's and it's so degrading because obviously none of that has ever happened but it's to belittle the hard work that I've put into my career really really grinds my gears okay but what you're doing right now is you're feeding the trolls you brought in all the comments are you having sex with your boss in order to get your job everything you said at all how offended you were of that control belt I know I know but to be to be absolutely honest I completely stopped a reading comments so they can go ahead and write them as much as they want I'm not gonna read you just fucked up right there sister you just open up the door the gates of hell do your thing no don't do it boys and girls everyone be kind yeah there's a real problem with writing things down online and not having any social cues not like looking at you and say you know Anna I watched your thing on science and you know I just want you to know that your grasp of physics is a bit off and this and you would go oh I'm you know I don't know shit about science then you'd laugh ha ha ha you both laugh together and that would be it you want that same guy on YouTube who's fucking dumb bitch there's no shit about science because he isn't in front of you he's not talking to you again as a human it goes back to the whole anonymity thing the thing that I actually worry about the most isn't even you know how my feelings are gonna get hurt because who cares like I'm a public figure I need to have thicker skin and it shouldn't bother me I worry about like if I if I meet someone I'm interested in and I'm dating him and then all of a sudden he decides first of all if I meet someone I'm interested in and I tell him what I do he's gonna Google me like that's the world we live in at this point right he's gonna Google me and he's gonna read the sum like the hideous shit that people say about me and then is that gonna influence his opinion of me like I worry about that kind of stuff more than that's hilarious do you really I do I mean there that would be the last thing that I would worry about that's the very last thing that I would worry about is meeting someone and having them been influenced by a Google search that's literally the last thing that I would worry I've been on the show since I was 20 and you want to know how many stupid things I've said on that show since I was 20 many that's normal it is it is normal anybody that pretends it's not like again you're just weeding out assholes any that anybody that pretends it's not normal to say something stupid when you're 20 and you're on a show that permanently records it my god if I ever got permanently recorded when I was 20 oh I'm in jail for hate crimes just for my words it's a retarded person when I was 20 I was - I think most people are fools when they're 20 of course you're basically a child definitely you know definitely there's no way that you should be held accountable responsible anybody should never stick it in your face things you did when you're you know much younger yeah I agree I agree but it'll happen I'm just weed out a dummy that you're on your life anyway you're right that's a good way of looking at it the best way of looking at it you know who you are if that guy can't figure that out fuck them yeah yeah look at me I'm like the new Oprah for women giving our advice teaching people how to fuck their relationships up do what you gotta do yeah yeah it's gotta be hard being a chick trying to trying to meet a dude out there in the wonderful world of and also being like a public figure yeah that's what I'm saying it is but whatever I think you're right you know you do weed out the assholes and you just you can't take yourself too seriously you can't date a regular dude either got a real problem what do you mean on the smart side yeah educate alone the articulate side that's a little intimidating for guys like you know what I'm not gonna get shut down by this one I'm just gonna pass I'm not gonna try you get a lot of that we're gonna know I think a lot of dudes probably go you know what this is never gonna happen really and then they just stop talking to you yeah Suze we get intimidated but that's good too right then you read out pussies does it suck I don't want those pussies I just I don't want those pussies to exist like you have nothing to be shy or intimidated about like whatever every every person can tell you something new right but I personally date yeah they can teach you now no but I will say that when you said you can't date a regular person I thought like you have to date another public figure you know I'm not interested no no I'm mad motherfucker you got to date some dude who's really smart definitely I'm definitely turned on by too much work intelligence checks like super laid back and you know low maintenance actually I'm not that bad I wouldn't think you were high maintenance but I would think that a woman who's a public know in all Bolton all seriousness that I would think that a woman who's a public figure a woman who's very articulate and intelligent and and it makes a living off of her opinions that's intimidated for a lot of dudes uh-huh especially people that are not good at expressing themselves like that's one of them what is the big thing with relationships it's a the weird sort of expression dance that you do with each other ya know how does how does she express when she's angry how do you express when you're angry who does it kindly who does it who's passive-aggressive who's intelligent when it comes to arguments do someone have an argument with you that's fucking rough action you argue on the Internet I haven't had an argument with a guy in a while exactly shared a bunch of bitches no say that I haven't put myself out there that much to be honest with you so I don't have too much experience with that I was in a really long-term relationship and then now I've just started dating that's where those 70s music comes in started dating crying inside funny thing is I'm 100% but I will say like I I live in like the gayest area of Los Angeles which means it's like impossible to meet guys near me and and you're right like I I don't know what too exciting for music right yeah Jamie yeah I don't know I'm just having fun so you have a problem in your neighborhood meeting guys yeah well I live in a gay neighborhood for me guys you pretend they're not gay like trying to pick up chicks yes I have I mean why the really gay and they just don't want to grab it okay so my best friend and I talk about this all the time I've been on a few dates with guys that I'm 100% certain or gay and and it's like why why are you trying to ruin my life right now like what do you think is gonna happen like you think I'm not gonna figure it out and I'm gonna end up like dating you long term and then you're gonna destroy my life no you're gay I can totally tell how can you tell you can just tell by the things I'm not look I'm not trying to push stereotypes but when you're with a straight guy you just know like there's certain body language that it indicates or implies that he's like aroused or he's into you you know what I mean like physically into you when you're like if I was a douche bag guy the way the douche bag guy translation to that is if you meet a girl and she's not turned down by you she's a fucking lesbian no I know you're saying that if he's not aroused by you he's gotta be good no that's not only what it sounds like that is what it sounds like that's not what I mean at all it's just it's hard to explain unless you're sitting there on that date with me is it like when you talk to a black guy on the phone and even if he's super educated you still know black terrible that's real that's some real shit I have talked to a lot of black guys on the phone where they were very articulate very intelligent very educated but I knew they were black uh-huh that's not a bad thing yeah it's not bad to be black I don't know I don't know what that means like you do how dare you how dare you bullshit me national internet program such as this you know I know and everybody listen to this including black people that might pretend to be offended you know what the fuck I'm saying listen to me there's zero wrong with being black absolutely nothing I am the least racist person you will ever meet I hope I have zero racism in me so I don't think it's possible to get any less racist however I am a person that likes to look at reality I think it's interesting to find what people do and don't get offended at and telling someone they sound black is not a bad thing but people sound black women and men I have talked to them on the phone and had wonderful elaborate conversations that I truly enjoyed but I knew I was talking to a black person but why because of their voice their the way they express themselves the way their their language is used the way they though the tonal quality the way they speak there's a certain way that black people speak that's slightly different white people can speak like black people I have been confused that way where I talk to a dude and he was a wig or and I thought I'm talking to a black eye and turned out that I was just talking to a white guy that really wishes he was black super normal yeah it happens a lot nothing wrong with it that's happening with a Chinese guy that was a freak out yeah I was talking to dude on the phone and then I met him in person and I was like oh he's a Chinese dude oh fuck I thought I was talking to a black guy it was weird yeah that is interesting going back to the whole gay thing because I want to kind of backpedal from what I said look I I'm in a unique position because of where I live and also I'm in Los Angeles which means a lot of people a lot of guys take a lot of pride in the way they look and they are almost proud of being overly feminine in some ways like they like the moisturizer and they like the fancy clothing and so then in that case there they used to be called metrosexuals I don't know what the politically correct term is now is that bad it's metrosexual no idea these terms are always changing man like sometimes do you think that it's a totally PC term and all of a sudden someone will like send you an angry email how dare you refer to us as metrosexuals but you know so I could be absolutely wrong and by the way I have been known at work for having terrible gaydar so maybe I am wrong yeah but but there's just it's freaking tough out there I don't listen I see what's going on I'll spell it out for you you're a hot chick if dudes don't move you say they gotta be gay no you probably correct - and I'm not a super hot chick but that does happen there is a lot of gay dudes who try to pretend to be straight I think for a society or for what have you they just keep it together as long as they can and then the fucking wheels fly off yeah and there was a guy that I used to work out with at this issue this guy used to work out this gym and he would talk about girls and the way the best way I could describe it is if I was speaking to you if you were French and I was saying the correct words but I had no idea what the fuck they meant I'm like John whatever level wants a table she but obviously I don't know what the fuck I'm saying you know yes riser the 40 year old virgin and how he was describing having sex do you remember that did you see that movie was so funny it was like he was like oh yeah I remember when I had like touched her breasts and they felt like they felt like sand bags it was just so obviously it never had before the guy that I was talking to just started talking about this interaction that he had with a woman in a nightclub and now this girl just came up to him and just started kissing him and making out with him it was like the way was saying it was like the worst like fake storytelling you could imagine he was like he was doing a sketch yeah yeah but he was a beautiful man like beautiful like big tall perfect bone structure just handsome and he had this girlfriend that just always had this perplexed look at her face like she just looked like like an explosion just went off like 30 seconds ago and she's trying to figure out what the fuck happened that's why she go she was like he was like she was batting way over her head with him he was at 10 and she was probably in the 6 or 7 range she was a little on the overweight side it was there was a it was a clear mismatch and it was just a gay guy who had this girlfriend oh but he was gay I have I can't believe I'm going to share this on the show my friends think it's so silly but I have something called the mediocre guy theory and the mediocre guy theory is do not date a guy who's overly attractive you're just asking for trouble because guys already have like this crazy confidence even if they're not very like they can't even if they're not the most attractive guy in the world usually they're they're usually pretty confident let me just point out first of all they're Armenian yeah and Armenian dudes are fucking savages in what way they're the most aggressive guys in the planet uh yeah I mean dudes we have a lot of Armenian fighters in the UFC and the fucking animals oh yeah I don't do savages those dudes are men those are wild men with hairy chests who will punch you in the face they're fucking crazy yes yes do you know how many people have asked me here from yeah I've never lived in Glendale I've only been in Glendale like a few times I'm the most Americanized Armenian it would be nice to meet an Armenian guy who's as Americanized as I am but most of them are very traditional which means we're gonna butt heads and I just don't I don't have to wear that gold chain that cry yeah I don't wear the cross of Jesus come on so your mediocre guy theory yeah so don't don't go after a guy who's extremely attractive because he's gonna get it first of all he's gonna be constantly told that he's attractive he's gonna constantly get attention from other women I don't I don't want to play that game like I just don't want to deal with that you know what I mean yeah like what you just said right now about the guy who's out of her league right let's say best-case scenario he's not gay and it's a straight couple or whatever right but like you don't want to feel like the guy you're dating is prettier than you Wow it's really would ever worry about that would you ever really ever think that a guy would be prettier the man is as as faithful as his opportunities okay the items Chris Rock joke it's not a joke it's might have been his joke but it's actually true yeah yeah like if a guy is really attractive and he's constantly getting like bombed on yeah like women throwing themselves at him then he's gonna cheat on you there's no question so you're better off shooting for the middle well the middle looks wise yeah looks are nice and by the way I'm I'm just talking bullshit right I've dated really hot guys before I believe it and whatever but but what matters to me most is like the chemistry and I'm talking about intellectual chemistry physical chemistry like there's got to be that connection course if that doesn't exist then I don't give a shit how good you look somehow know that this has turned into the longest episode of the dating show ever I know sorry about that those shows were great don't do those anymore never have dating shows now because of stalking issues I think remember they used to have those the dating game and you know people would they would be wearing those weird suits with the fucking bell-bottoms and they'd tell what they do bachelor number one yes I met you and I was on a beach looking for shells and you wanted to get my attention what would you say to me you know there's too many legal legal issues yeah they were super cheesy anyway do you uh do you find that you meet guys like inside your community and like dating like other reporters or journalists or people in that world mm-hmm um yeah I mean there have definitely been some people I've run into or I'm like oh my god you know he's super smart he's a good-looking guy like we should probably go out of date except he's gay no no that's not the case I just I feel weird I feel weird dating someone that I work with right or someone that I'm gonna run into often with my career because I don't want to burn burn bridges it might end disastrously so I just don't want to do that and plus on top of that I'm I'm more interested in dating someone who has a completely different career than mine because I want to learn something from someone I'm dating we're very lucky Brian read bands on here right now because he would be fucking throwing them [Laughter] like when we're different totally different do you worry at all that with the stuff that you're doing that there will be repercussions do you ever think like when the michael hastings thing went down did you guys freak out a little bit course what did you think happened there for folks who don't know tell the story of what michael hastings did and then what happened to him yeah so michael hastings was one of the few real journalists left in the u.s. he was one of the few journalists who actually gave a shit about holding politicians accountable for their actions and he was so driven he was one of the most driven people that i've ever met in my entire life he made me feel like shit about my career on a regular basis because he was so inspiring and so just hardworking and determined you know so he broke the story about General Stanley McChrystal basically long story short Stanley McChrystal was saying some crazy shit about Obama basically criticizing him behind closed doors michael hastings wrote a rolling stone piece about it and the Obama administration forced McChrystal to resign so that was a really big story michael hastings won awards for it and you know that kind of put him on the map he wrote many great books and he he was just a great journalist but the most important thing to keep in mind is he was one of those people who was fearless when it came to holding the government accountable okay and you don't see that often then all of a sudden you know in June of 2013 he gets into this really mysterious car accident at 4:00 I believe 4:20 in the morning 4:30 in the morning around then and he was speeding in the silver Mercedes and he crashed into a palm tree and the car exploded on impact and everyone was wondering whether or not this was something that was basically orchestrated by the government or if this was a real accident now in terms of you know those rumors and the conspiracy theories I feel very irresponsible speculating one way or another I don't know what happened no one knows what happened all I do know is I worked closely with him at the Young Turks he was on our show often I co-hosted a few episodes with and I remember sitting in the makeup chair getting ready to go on air when I found out that he had died in this car accident and I've never felt the way I felt in that moment it was like a ton of bricks like had just fallen on me and I was just like tearing up and I couldn't believe it and so I wanted to do an investigation we don't have the resources to do and a full investigation into this but there were so many weird crazy aspects of it that didn't make sense like his his engine being tossed so far away from his car the fact that the car exploded I contacted Mercedes Benz they refused to answer any questions and I asked him I'm like look don't comment on the michael hastings story comment on what happens in your crash tests is this typical of a crash and they would not answer any questions i tracked down the one witness that saw the entire accident from beginning to end he he was Mexican he only spoke Spanish and we got a translator and he told us exactly what he saw and he said that michael hastings was in fact speeding really really fast but that doesn't really answer any questions either because some people are wondering whether or not the government can manipulate his car to make it accelerate to the point where he gets into a crash I don't know I've read stories where it's possible but it's very very difficult to do so again I feel uncomfortable speculating but what I do know is his family including his brother have said that he was increasingly paranoid leading up to the accident he was unstable his brother was really concerned that he was um you know abusing drugs which is why he flew to Los Angeles to help him out his brother I think was the last person to see him prior to the accident at least that's what he's alleging and I again I don't know what happened but it did have severe ramifications for people who want to be investigative journalists because if that fear does exist if that is even a possibility it's gonna deter you from doing real investigative journalism it's gonna deter you from holding the government accountable because you know that the NSA is watching every fucking move you know that if you're watching the wrong kind of porn or if you're doing something that's a little questionable according to societal morals and or norm then the government can find that and they can leak that to the public and they can destroy your reputation do you as a journalist want to take that risk to do what a journalist is supposed to do and I think a lot of people out there are unwilling to do it and I don't blame them it's scary to know that the government can come after you if they wanted to that's all so if this is what happened yeah and I'm not in again no I know I appreciate that you're doing that yeah no I think that's really important because we really don't know what happened I I looked at it when it first happened I was pretty freaked out too because I was like wow and I thought about it for a minute and I'm like this guy was going after generals you know I mean these are people who are professional killers they've been killing for the government for a long time they know how to do it really well they have friends they could pull favors and they can make some shit happen I mean it is possible did it happen it's also possible that the dude was doing drugs and he was going crazy but from the trauma of this whole thing about thinking constantly that the government's after you I mean that might be just enough to get you to fucking kill yourself it might not have to do it they might have to just scare you and freak you out and get you to believe that they're watching every move you make and waiting for their time to lower the boom on you yep and and that's that's basically what I'm referring to that paranoia alone is crippling it was crippling for michael hastings and it's crippling for people that I work with that want to do the type of journalism that he did and that's why I fear for people like Glenn Greenwald Glenn Greenwald is in my opinion a hero I look up to him so much he's the one who broke the Edward Snowden's story he's the one who's you know revealing things that Americans should know about what frustrates me is a lot of Americans feel that someone like Edward Snowden is a traitor he's not a traitor he's telling you about how your civil liberties are being violated this is the kind of stuff that should make people want to stand up instead of having a discussion about what we should do to stop the government from spying on us we're having ridiculous conversations about whether or not Edward Snowden can be considered a traitor or an American hero that is a stupid conversation okay we know the information now we know what the government is doing the government is indiscriminately collecting our metadata and they are holding information for a period of time and they can use it to intimidate you if you're a political activist or if you're a journalist that intimidation is what cripples our democratic process so I have a lot of problems with that and I worry that there aren't gonna be many journalists left that will do what Michael Hastings was willing to do no doubt and it was a huge price this guy had to pay I mean he's living in Russia now hiding doing IT work yeah learning how to speak Russian most likely if he lives he's gonna be there for the rest of his life and what kind of crazy stress is he under he had a hot girlfriend and a cushy job in Hawaii he left all of that yeah it was a pretty pretty bold move and the the information that's come out has really changed the way people look at the government and and how they're like how they're handling privacy how they're handling this idea of the war on terror and what what they're willing to do and not willing to do they're willing to violate everything I mean they're willing to go against the very principles of privacy like every principle of the the idea that you're sending someone something you have a password you log in they have a password they log in you send them an email so if someone doesn't get in there and breach it you're thinking that what's going on here is a completely private conversation no no the government gets to look at it not only that but some fucking employee that they kept going on and on about how we never graduated high school remember that I'm aware they were shitting on him and trying to demean him by saying that he never graduated high school then why did you give him access to our private information why'd you hire him didn't graduate high school it seems crazy and the worst part about it is I mean we have so many private contractors that have access to our private information it's fascinating yeah it's it's a fascinating time and I think that we're moving closer and closer to some strange point in the future where the idea of privacy is a thing of the past it's not it's non-existent I think that's gonna happen I don't I don't think you can avoid that I think that is without with whether it's a decade from now or two or three or whatever it is I think there's going to come a point in time where the boundaries between people and information are no longer no longer exists I feel like we're gonna get to a point where we will just be desensitized to all private information so what people worry about most is like let's say you're not a politician you're just a political activist you might be worried that the government might use some information about you to intimidate you and cause you to not be politically active anymore so it could be something like nude pictures of yourself that you emailed or it could be the porn that you watch whatever I feel like with the way things are going eventually we're gonna get to a point where all of our dirty laundry is just gonna be out there and everyone's gonna be like oh all right whatever you know because you're gonna be forced to there's gonna be so much crap out there about everyone yeah you're just gonna have to deal with it well that's gonna be the future right that's like that's one generation from now or two generations whatever it is those people are gonna have no privacy from birth to death I know I know we're willingly putting our crap out there as it is with social media once again I think it's a trend I think it's just like the technology trend I think we're moving in a certain direction and we don't there's no way you're gonna stop it it's not like a cultural thing like like different types of marriages or different types of you know tribal tribal government it's not like that like it's way bigger than that and it's it seems to have a momentum all of its own yeah and the momentum of information is the ability to exchange it and share it gets quicker and easier it's constantly through time it does so you have you know you have two kids how do you plan on talking to them about social media because I always wonder about that there are so many parents who like willingly put so much information about their babies online which I find fascinating you know what kind of conversation do you think you're gonna have with your kids when it comes to oversharing online because I think that's an important conversation to have it's definitely important to let them know that what they're doing can be seen by virtually every human being that exists it's it's that it's at that point if you put something on a facebook page essentially I mean whether or not you get 14 thousand hits or 14 billion it's it's really the same thing you're anybody that gets to that spot can get there and you got to realize that like once you let it out there that's that's just this new weird connection where anyone can look at your pictures and if they're on Facebook they can comment and they could say weird shit and they can they could be lecherous they could be strange that's the reality the world we live in now you know I think you definitely especially for girls you definitely want to be very careful about what you share and what you don't share I mean how many times you go into someone's Twitter page they send you a tweet and you go let me just read their their tweets like sometimes people say something interesting and I'll go read their timeline let's look at their pictures oh there's four tits like what it's amazing that not even pornstar girls just holding her tits out smiling I just don't I don't know I don't get it I don't know if that's like a societal pressure that they're caving into or if it's just stupidity maybe they just really like dick and they just want to coming in on a daily basis a lot of shipments and the best way show them what you got I'm I don't know I deal with way too much like crap online to put myself out there like that there's no way in hell I would I talk about this a lot you know every time we do a story about some teenager who like sex did a picture of herself and then you know it got leaked online I'm like don't take naked pictures of yourself just don't fucking do it don't do it under any circumstance I have a strict rule about that so or do it fuck it what are you worried about well I agree with you comfortable with people like sharing your naked picture because you sent a naked picture to a guy it's over he it is over he's gonna show it to his friends and then he might put it online and he's gonna destroy your life and the thing is we still live in that puritanical society where if that naked picture surfaces at work you could lose your job as a result of that that's ridiculous yeah did you hear about the guy who got lost his job because he was mr. t for Halloween in Toronto he's mr. t and I was like this country's going crazy and people like that's not even this country I get it I know it's an expression yeah I put on blackface so they fired him who's the teacher uh-huh he was trying to be mr. t how could you be mr. t without blackface like are you really saying this is there something wrong with that he's wearing a fucking outfit it's not like he's putting on a minstrel show and singing mammy and got like big fake lips and it's not that's not what he's doing I know but look Canada might be a little different but blackface is a really dark history especially in the United States you think if you play mr. t I don't I don't I don't I don't think you should fire I do think it's bad I don't think you should get fired I don't think oh my god I don't think you should get fired but it's offensive it's offensive it's offensive for a Halloween costume I think it is mmm that's hilarious what if you wear a red face and if you want to be an Indian can you do that okay what about yellow face why don't you be why can't you be mr. t without the black face people are gonna get in your way that's fucking ridiculous okay what about Seoul man that movie with a guy wore black face through the whole movie remember that guy I don't even know that movie yes he Thomas Howard you remember that guy nope see he was before your time see Thomas Howell was one of those guys who's like this major league movie star did a lot of big movies and then just stop doing them he was in like he was way back in like the what's that side out sowhat's side out fuck do you remember that dare you so man he was using the the The Outsiders or what was the one with Johnny Depp and those are the outsiders and he played a guy who wore blackface I pretended to be a black eye for something like to get in college or something like that uh-huh and I mean through the whole movie he wore blackface so you think that's there is he's black not hilarious yeah black guy in school in blackface this was like in the 1980s look at this he's got a jheri curl wig on that's the same I don't know my the standard is probably a little different in movies but I don't know and these are more more real than Halloween is that what you're saying no movies are not more real than Halloween it's look I just I think that given the history of blackface and given how offensive it is to the black community mm-hmm why do I go there why I don't understand I don't understand the value of it okay so you want to look even more like mr. t or whatever like just it's fine you can do it without doing the blackface given our history and given how offensive it is just move forward that's hilarious I couldn't disagree more I think it's just an outfit I think if you're really pretending that if you're a completely non racist guy and you put some paint on that makes you look more like an african-american that somehow you're doing something offensive I think that's silly I think the idea of a white person pretending to be a black person is just as weird as the idea of a black person pretend to be a white person but who gives a shit if a black guy puts white face on and does that thing that Dave Chappelle used to do in a show or pretend to be a white man reading the news you know with white paint on nobody gave a fuck yeah well white people were not made fun of and discriminated against and and freakin lynched and murdered and did you see pineapple Express Tropic Thunder Tropic Thunder with Robert Downey jr. where he wears blackface through the whole movie I did not see that fucking beautiful movie he played a black eye I mean the entire movie that's really that's I look that's a really interesting argument and I might reconsider my thoughts on it but based on based on where I stand now I just feel like look I feel really uncomfortable with it just just because how society would make fun of black people by making white actors put the blackface on and and you know mimic them and make them seem like they were morons and they were less than it just has such a dark history so if people find it offensive I'm definitely empathetic toward that so Al Jolson basically fucked up Halloween that's what you're saying definitely well that stupid blackface and racist bullshit I think if you're racist you're racist and I thinking if you're not racist then there's no nothing wrong with pertaining to be a black person you're gonna be it for Halloween it's one thing if you're like mocking black people in general that's offensive but you're a guy a specific guy you're mr. t got gold chains on your Halloween dude there's Dave Chappelle potamia white guy that's real racism right there yeah he does it that was a terrible just as bad as see Thomas how I'll pretend to be black I don't know I see your point though and I appreciate it I appreciate that where you're coming from it's like why do it it's not worth it and it's not worth it I mean I wouldn't want to be mr. t for Halloween yeah and I see a point where it's different in a movie I guess but I don't think I wouldn't bother me if one of my friends was mr. t I wouldn't be like man you're fucking racist bro you have makeup on you're racist there was there was a story about these two women in England or two girls in England and they were dressed as the World Trade Center on fire after the attack and they and they had people like little fake people jumping out of the costume and to add insult to injury they were part of this costume contest and they won they won best contest or bit I'm sorry best costume so like what amazes me is how little people think these things through before they do it you see what I'm saying like I mean there are some things that you just do not mess with and that's a perfect example of something you don't mess with especially considering that there are family members that lost people as a result of those attacks family members who saw their own family members jumping off those buildings and then you have these two dumbasses wearing this stupid costume kind of making fun of that situation it's just there are some things you don't mess with and that's that's a perfect example of it well I think it's another example of really dumb people getting together and convincing each other that everything's gonna be cool yeah like oh my god such a great idea isn't it look at fire in their little bubble it was a great idea because they won yeah you could pull that off if you lived in a small town in Alaska before the Internet yeah yeah when people didn't know any better but now especially if that picture goes on Facebook or something like that Oh prepare yourself ma'am yeah the avalanche of hate Asiana Airlines pilot costume maybe most offensive of 2013 who is that I don't know this story the pilots that crashed the pilots that plane that crashed in San Francisco a couple months ago what was there oh oh they dress okay oh god they just don't why why are people so dumb people are dumb they just dumb they want to be shocking to they want to be paid attention to and if you go as like the Hulk no one's gonna give a fuck ya know there's a million of those out there but if you go as this people go oh my god what are you doing and then they pay attention to you that's what it is yep they just want to get a little shock just get a little rise out of people yeah it's true um Julianne Hough who was one of the Dancing with the Stars performers or whatever she dressed in blackface and I feel like I feel like you should hold publics public figures to a higher standard because I think you're more aware of this kind of shit like more aware of the kind of criticism you're gonna get you know what I mean like you're you're putting yourself out there people are gonna see you yeah and and so I I almost feel as though what is she supposed to be she's supposed to be one of the characters from Orange is the new black I forget the character's name she doesn't really look black she looks more bronze and I think she's got a really bad fake tan she went like to West Hollywood and got a spray tan yeah one of them real ones yeah and so she was like what I'm like I had no idea I apologize she had this apology and like that I felt like was a little bit of a publicity stunt that's my speculation yeah probably most likely well probably this people were just dumb and that's not as dark it's like one of those bodybuilder women when they get that spray tan stuff like they get really really dark are you into girls that would potentially kick my ass yeah or be more manly than me yeah my favorite discussions on the show usually center around like the appropriate way a female body part should look I don't remem your guest was but you guys were talking about the appropriate look I guarantee you I know it was Jim Norton it was Jim Norton Dirty Bastard yes and that was after I was confirmed to come on your show and I remember talking to my friend Christian who loves your show by the way Christian Lopez he wanted me to say hello what's up there you go and I was like what the fuck did I just get myself into right now we give out a bad impression no not at all you're totally fine I'm like we do we do give out a bad impression if you wanted to cherry pick shit out of our past you know the things that we've done on the show yeah I could look I could look a little sketch yeah yeah well I mean that's true if you cherry-pick but people like to compare you to Howard Stern I actually don't think you're like Howard Stern at all I think that you're a little more intelligent Howard Stern is a brilliant man he is a brilliant man wrong yeah he is I think that the topics you choose to talk about are a little more intelligent well you know he does a lot of pop culture stuff yeah you know interviews a lot of artists and he's really good at getting them to talk and say things maybe they ordinarily that they would but you know I mean I think he's also got a much larger audience and there's also a bunch of people behind him that probably would kind of like want him to talk about certain subjects but I have you know we started this out just on the laptop and I don't really give a fuck what other people are interested in I give a fuck what I'm interested in and this whole thing started out just for fun so if I like yesterday I had a real astronaut on I mean I had that dude who was on the you leave a book now he didn't he sold much send it to us he was on the space station for 166 days and was really fucking interesting stuff yeah it was fascinating Chris Hadfield he's he's awesome he was a that was like a real honor like that to me it's like that's the kind of people that I want to talk to I just want to talk to fascinating people yeah I just Ryan the guy who we were looking at his photo before yeah I love Chris Ryan he's great he's been on our show several times he's just really interesting I loved his openness about sexuality and you and you know what humans are actually you know physically driven to do biologically driven to do and it's very different from societal norms and expectations so there's always that conflict there we're just a stand-up comedian or just an MMA fighter or just a friend I mean I've had just friends on it's just I think too many people are out there trying to get the attention of people by like having people on they're famous or you know pop-culture not interesting to tap into sometimes to find out what makes them tick but for me I want to talk to like Neil deGrasse Tyson I want to talk to Sam Harris I want to talk to brilliant people I want to talk to people and pick they're bringing people that don't normally hear on the radio or don't normally hear interviewed on television shows yeah I mean and going back to the discussion we had on new media that's what Millennials respond to better they like the interviews with real people or brilliant people who are trying to make a difference in the world they like that way more than you know the celebrity bullshit because the celebrity stuffs fun too it's fun it's fun but it's knacks yeah I mean I think Millennials will take that for what it's worth but they're more interested in change I and that and that's the reason why most of them voted for Obama because he kept preaching change even though we didn't really get any of it yeah so but like of a like with Stern interviews like Corey Feldman I'm gonna listen to that you never mean like I'm gonna hear I'm there for the train wreck oh I remember very recently Howard Stern interviewed Sharon Osbourne one person that I couldn't possibly care less about and it was such a fascinating interview and I was like that's the magic of Howard Stern he he can make any interview interesting because he will ask an appropriate question if he digs into your psyche mm-hmm someone like Sharon Osbourne yeah you know what the fuck is going on there I don't know yeah madness craziness yeah the the idea of having a podcast is I mean I never really thought that I would ever have a radio show cuz I always kind of figured like know that I always enjoyed going on morning radio and I was enjoyed it when I would go and do stand-up I would come in early to promote and you do radio like back in the days for the Internet that's how you sold tickets and I always had a good time on the air and I said wow I would be cool to have a radio show but then I was like you the fuck's gonna give me a radio job and and that's not gonna happen and on top of that they're gonna tell me I can't swear and that shit's gonna get tired and then satellite radio came along and I started doing the Opie and Anthony show a lot uh-huh and those guys are great and they're the way they'd have it set up is a lot like this show where it's just a conversation yeah they don't have like a specific agenda they don't have games who want to play all right Anna it's time to play what would you rather do you know they don't have that kind of stupid shit it's just a conversation just a hang and so that's really what sort of fueled getting this thing started but that was so you have a three hour long show do you ever have a difficult time waiting my bladder well yes that's a that's a good question but on top of that it's really difficult to find guests that are willing to have a three hour long conversation yeah well yes it no you know we don't have a hard time finding guests but yeah some people are just not it's not right for them some people don't want to talk for three hours because if you talk for three hours long enough people are gonna find out who the fuck you really are yep that's true it just takes time yeah you know and they're gonna find out what two weeks you or what you know what you like what you don't like what's weird about you they get to know you like very very deeply do you think your audience has a good sense of my weird yeah being a nice person the weird thing is like who the fuck's not weird you know everyone's weird everyone's got their like little habits and stuff I was talking to my friend about how important it is to be open-minded especially at this point in our lives like when we're you know willing to meet new people and make new friends and all that other stuff and like you come across people that have certain habits that are just strange and when I was younger I'd be like uh like I just don't I don't want anything to do with this person and now I love this I love that I've grown into this person where where where I will step back I'll realize that something's weird and it'll make me uncomfortable I'll ask why it makes me uncomfortable and it'll be like all right that's fine it's not something that's gonna hurt me or damaged me so live with it bother me like if you're out with people and they're holding hands and you like so what's your deal and like oh we're swingers where to go swing it I mean if your fingers like I don't want to join you guys but but no one does me do you yeah yeah they're always disgusting humans I don't know I've actually never met swingers I met two swingers in my whole life that were like out and now tell me they were swingers like introduce themselves swingers one of them Ari and I were in Nashville we were doing stand-up and this guy was driving us around for two days and he was a limo driver and did just like yes sir no sir and then finally he's dropping us off at the airport and the dougas opens up the floodgates and just starts talking about swinging in and what he what he does what he likes to do and you know you know I don't really like to watch my wife get fucked but sometimes she likes watching me have sex and you know I don't I don't feel comfortable about a guy I could tell her no and we were like what like honey what I wonder what kind of guys he's uncomfortable with big ones probably and yeah he's probably a fan of the mediocre guy theory absolutely yeah you don't want to let your girlfriend get gorilla fucked by some giant lineman in front of you you know that would be horrendous that was that's the last thing you want so he can like give the red light he's he will save himself for a guy who's coughing someone a man with a limp you know honey yeah yeah just try to find some guy who's like less endowed than you yes yeah that's understandable though you don't want to deal with that competition I guess yeah sad we had a conversation about like furries on the show oh yeah and so I don't see anything I mean I I don't prefer furries don't get me wrong but like whatever they like to dress up as animals when they're having sex like I don't care if that doesn't bother if I found out someone I'm hanging out with is into that then I would just be like alright you're into that it's totally fine really so if you were dating a guy and you found out that he was into being a furry and he would go to furry conventions they'd sniff each other's fake butt bounce around like squirrels you'd be like that's fine I don't have a problem with that come on um you would judge him I don't I'm not enough okay I would like to say that I would not judge him I would judge the shit out of girl if I was dating and I was and I met a girl and we're hanging out and she's pretty cool and she's like well there's this one thing that I really like to do I like to pretend to be a chipmunk mascot and I put on my chipmunk mascot outfit on and I go to these conventions in Pittsburgh we all fly in with our furry outfits on and we dance around together and we plan to pretend have sex but no one really penetrates anybody yeah I look it is what it is I feel like they're definitely they're worse fetishes out there like guys who like to wear diapers and they like to get changed like that that kind of stuff scares the hell out of me even preach that conversation I don't even know I don't even know I I don't know how I give them a like furries for instance I give them props because how do you find someone who's willing to deal with your fetish well I think there's something in being willing to deal with almost anything that's like it's extra attractive you have to be open-minded yeah well when people start dating each other this is my thing my thinking on it is that when when people start dating each other if someone really wants someone to be a part of their life they might like want to do something like really weird with them to show them that I do not care I'll do anything I'll change your diaper I'll wipe your butt oh my god like I remember a dude that I know he would take we were at a fight it was backstage my friend was warming up in the greenroom and this dude went into the bathroom with his girlfriend and took a shit like in front of her there's like little bathroom together and I go did you just take a shit in front of her really because I went in there afterwards it was her he wrecked the bathroom but why but I asked him I go I go what's that about he goes we do everything together man we do everything together no that's not healthy that's not healthy though how can you say it's not an you stay wearing a fucking furry outfit is no but that there's like a codependency issue there that's not healthy if you have to do everything together that would be my nightmare my goal in life is to find a guy that is comfortable with me living my life and not just do this right now running on Twitter I I feel like sometimes like my issue is I'm too like wrapped up in my career bubble and I'm really attracted to like independent guys that don't want a girl who's like always on him like guys guys pretend like they don't like that but they do they want a girl who's all about him all the time and I'm just not that kind of person especially you have your own career yeah that's too inconvenient I love it I love like independent strong people like that's the biggest turn-on to not me I like I'm weak dependent a lot of people do like that date codependency is a real issue yeah well people want I mean isn't that really the mediocre guy theory that you want to make sure it doesn't go anywhere no sort of similar and by the way I don't just to be completely crystal clear my mediocre guy theory is a little bit of a joke like question like obviously I don't want a mediocre guy and obviously I want a guy that I'm physically attracted to but I do believe that a guy is as faithful as his opportunities same goes for women by the way it's not just men those dirty bitches I can't believe I'm saying that yeah well you know what it's especially human beings when they're not like if you're not if you if you haven't found someone that enthralls you or someone that you're like deeply locked in with it's real easy to like lose a relationship but you've got a relationship it's like you know I not invest any more time in this and then boom and guys that were always worried about the music ending and then being left without a chair you know like hey you know you're playing musical chairs the music stops and there's nowhere to sit down I mean no one wants me that's that thing that thing that a lot of people want someone to want them and if they're dating an independent woman they realize like this chick whether she enjoys your company or not she could do without you dude and she's fine you know that that freaks guys out a lot of guys they want some girl who's like waiting by the phone when you call her oh my god I was so happy you called should I say that you know they love Stu pure virtual that's such ha ha no it's true it's the same reason why like people pretend they like to fight like men like always say like oh if I knew if I was a black belt I'd go to the UFC kick everybody's ass nuts that's not what you don't understand what you're saying what you're saying is you would like to beat somebody up but you don't really actually want to fight because the fighting is fucking brutal and somebody might beat you up you could lose it's not guaranteed it's a risky wild the whole thing the whole the whole proposition is incredibly risky so our relationships relationships are unbelievably risk of course so a lot of people don't even want to enter in relationship they just want to smash it they just want to go in there and kick somebody's ass the same way they want to go in there and kick somebody's ass in a fight and not actually be in a fight they don't want to date some girl's smart intelligence gonna see through my bullshit and I can't use all the stuff that I learned in my pickup artist book that I've been reading for the past six months you gonna see right through that and you're gonna you know pick out the flaws and all my arguments fuck that I'm just looking for a dumb chick with a limp that I could dominate for a short amount of time and then bail that is a sexy man right there it's a weak dude but there's a lot of them yes cuz people are scared of failure I've met some really like strong intelligent confident men and I love that they exist they exist they're like they're very very rare but they exist I know I should I shouldn't even say they're very very rare how do I know it's not like I've been dating like a billion guys right but they exist and and and when I say that I like the independence it doesn't mean like I don't need him it means this person makes me a better person and I want to make him a better person we have this strong bond this strong partnership but we don't suffocate each other I think a lot of relationships are suffocating and I want to avoid that at all costs you know what I mean yeah it's it's tough to not be suffocating sometimes if you're scared you're clinging on to the last piece of wood you found floating in the ocean yeah and after the horrible wreck of the rest last X amount of years of your life that's a lot of people you run into them you're not just running into a person you're running into a person and it's just getting back on their feet from somewhat fuck a disaster whatever it was whatever breakup whatever you know home repossession lost job with it what is the crisis that you just recently survived and just washed up on shore and now you're meeting that person so let me meet someone in their 30s oh my god you're meeting a lot of shit you meeting a lot of shits a lot of years it's not a bad thing some people are better for it though I mean there's the bright side of it some people because of all those disasters they develop character and they understand what's good and not good what how they should behave what are the ramifications of you know different kinds of behaviors yeah do you find that out but you know how many people learn from their mistakes half at least half I hope I would hope but I don't think it's even forty I think it's probably the recipe were just banging their heads on coconut trees people are crazy they are crazy I just I feel like it's better to look if you don't meet someone that makes you feel good about yourself and you do the same for them I feel like it's just better to be alone and live your life and and wait if you know lady with a lot of cats in a vibrator maybe not the cats did you see that new oculus rift thing they have the 3d reality goggles I've come up with one now that allows you to have sex it connects you to some sort of an artificial thing that's like a flashlight that's moving up no I I know nothing about that but I have like read stories about robots that they're creating that are very lifelike so you know women will be useless in you know 10 years or something when these are perfected in Japan I'm just I'm kidding about the women being used yeah they'll be for some men there'll be something that they won't have the effort to pursue anymore right that's gonna be real I've talked I've talked to a guy who cannot wait I cannot wait for these sex robots to be perfected so and he's like totally honest about he's like yeah they're so lifelike that you can like have a relationship with a sex robot and it's like I don't I don't even know what my response should be to that where it will always be an empty hollow relationship there's always gonna be something missing from it you're always gonna want to have sex with them maybe ya know if they look like superhot robots but hanging out with them there's gonna come a point in time when you realize that this is just a bunch of circuits just a bunch of electrical impulses going through a board staring at you and coming at you with some pre-recorded voice yeah it's gonna be weird I people are always going to that part of what people like about people is that we're all in this crazy thing together yeah that's true and and you know going back to the necessity of human interaction in some Asian countries they prostitutes offer something called the girlfriend experience and they probably do that here in the United States too but I distinctly remember talking about it in Korea I believe and they don't just have sex with the guys like they in some cases they never have sex with the guys the guys will pay for the girl to be like a girlfriend where she's like nurturing and caring and cuddles with him and watches movies with him and stuff like that and that actually gave me a little bit of faith in humanity because that showed me that there are people out there that just want that you know that connection they want more than that physical raw interaction they want something emotional yeah there's always going to be that but they would like to fuck as well that's true the problem is a lot of times the girlfriend experience is 50 bucks whereas the other thing if you want to actually have sex like 125 so you have to budget you know if you're living in Japan the time you're not buying it what you think no those guys are they're cuddling because they do want to cuddle but they definitely want to move to the next level I don't think you're giving guys enough credit I think that guys I they like they like to pretend like they don't have any emotional connection or want that emotional connection but a lot of them want oh yeah no don't get me wrong I'm not saying that men definitely want an emotional connection with a girlfriend or a wife or a woman in their life what you know label it in any way you want but they also want to fuck so if they can't get that if all they can get is cuddling don't say cuddling but they would like a little bit more it's just natural okay why would someone be affectionate with me but not want to please me all the way get rid of this throbbing thing yeah like that's just a natural it mean it's as natural as like you know eating one piece of your food and wanting to eat the rest of it yes it's natural it's come lately natural yeah so like there was a thing recently where a woman was like making $90 now or cuddling with people she was like hi hi girl out to cuddle yeah people that's I mean I couldn't do it but make money cause I was thinking of like what a dangerous situation that is for the girl to be with some man holding on to her like you know in like very close proximity like how many guys are just gonna start beating off on her back you know how many guys are gonna be cuddling with her and try to rape her it's like I wouldn't trust a guy to cuddle with him like that me as a guy I wouldn't trust a guy yeah we're not cuddling dude look I don't know what the legality of that is but it does go back to the whole prostitution issue and how important it is to legalize and regulate it and create a safe environment for women to do that type of stuff so you can actually mitigate or minimize you know those types of instances where a guy will be abusive or do something degrading or demeaning the worry is also I mean always that you're promoting it and then if you make prostitution legal and the prostitution that would never go to prostitution before so what are you there with those lawyer women and all you sell your vaginas down the river just sell them I just feel like people who want to have relations with a prostitute or gonna do it anyway and if legalizing prostitution somehow convinces someone who wouldn't otherwise go to a prostitute to go through with it then okay like there are worse things in the world it's just it's sex so what I agree with you I'm obviously playing devil's advocate but what was it that being on the show changed where you had this shift in your attitude about legalized prostitution I worried about the safety of the women that put themselves in that situation and also the safety of men that put themselves in that situation because if you regulate it you can ensure that these women are getting tested for STDs you don't want a bunch of people getting you know AIDS or other sexually transmitted diseases pregnant pregnant you know a regulated industry in this case would be much better than you know criminalizing it and allowing people to harm themselves or be put in a harmful situation and on top of that here's another thing I don't want to do I don't want to waste our resources on incarcerating people for these called sex crimes because I don't see prostitution as a sex crime I see it as a normal human behavior people want sex some people unfortunately have to pay for sex but if if that transaction has to happen let it happen let it be regulated let's get it off the streets and put it in a place that's safer that's just better for society no that's a totally rational way of looking at it yeah and unfortunately we have this weird attitude when it comes to sexuality and we have this weird attitude when it comes to naked people I mean remember that Janet Jackson thing we showed a nipple in the Superbowl and everybody lost their fucking mind it's we're really weird in that way it's okay to give someone a massage you could rub their feet to the cows come home with oil who could rub them they can moan out loud oh my god good nobody has a problem with it rub my back rub my butt don't touch my dick whoa that's a crime that's a crime even though it would feel fantastic if you did I can't do it you consider that cheating like if you are married and you'd well you are married but like if you were to go to a massage parlor and get that done would that be considered cheating I definitely think it would take you in a lot of trouble of course it would like it seems like someone would not be happy about that but it would be awesome if they were if you could just go and what if they were on masks like one of those Mexican wrestlers you even know what they look like you go in there with like a Wolfman mask on you pick a dress like a Mexican wrestler you don't even look at each other you both wear sunglasses it's just so it's just like a massage in a situation like that it's really not that different that's the reason why they do it at a massage parlor right you know and the real the guys pro-tips guys actually get a massage and then get a happy ending they don't just go right for the happy ending so the legit pros have a real massage first how does that conversation come up like how do you find a massage parlor that is willing to do that there's web sites there are yes fascinating web sites that'll tell you where the spots are and you know like they'll rate places with stars and detail their hand job experiences Wow and of course it doesn't just stop at a handjob it was further than that in some cases right allegedly mm-hmm allegedly yeah it's it's one of those weird things where we've decided that people can do it for free and no one gets hurt yeah but if they do it for money it's illegal in the eye the the logic behind it is very weird and the logic behind the laws are you know there's there's morality ideas there's ethics ideas but the reality is that money is gonna be changing hands whether you like it or not and most likely it's not going to get taxed unless it's legal yeah it's just gonna it's just gonna move into the economy and some sort of a weird way but the government in that in in and also in drug laws they're fuckin themselves at a massive amounts of revenue I know more on drugs is the most colossal fuckin failure of a war in the his you guys during the time you're at war the business got bigger it got WAY huge or everywhere in the world it's a huge part of the economy and the business has become medical in California very sixteen other states legal in two states now now legal in Portland Maine it's the worst failure of a war ever it is and when you look at the war on drugs specifically the war on marijuana very little of it has to do with stopping people from using these drugs most of it has to do with paying for correctional officers paying for private prisons paying for private contractors even private contractors abroad who continue to amplify the war on drugs people are making a ton of money off this prohibition which is why it continues and it'll never stop and I love that we're seeing the snowball effect with the legalization of recreational marijuana or recreational use of marijuana there was recently a small town in the East Coast that legalized it I believe it was in Maine yes Portland Maine yeah it was Portland Maine they just legalized it and it was more of a symbolic thing because of course state laws and federal laws will trump you know whatever municipal laws have been passed but I love that now politicians are forced to pay attention to the polls and make changes because we're spending untold amounts of money just incarcerated people for simple marijuana possession it's hideous it isn't the the real problem with the war on drugs being with when you have marijuana illegal it means you're not getting that tax money from it just like you're not getting it from prostitution you the government doesn't get their cut they're not getting it it's gonna make its way into the economy in some ways like in BC and British Columbia there there's a huge issue because a giant chunk of their economy is based on marijuana but yet marijuana is illegal they arrest people but they let them go there's like a lot of weird fucking games going on up there but because it's illegal they're not getting their taxes from it it's a huge issue they know it's a giant there was a documentary that I was in called the Union and it was all about that's what they call it they called the Union when they talk about the the all the different marijuana growers in BC it's like they're a multi-billion dollar part of the economy up there so it's this weird hypocrisy that's going on where you have this thing that's a huge part of why everybody's doing well yeah and that thing's illegal and that thing's hurting no one and by the way because it's illegal you're not getting your cut do you know about the Shaffer report what's during the oh I love this story I love telling the story so during the Nixon administration Nixon wanted to commission a study on marijuana specifically do you know about it I know about the Nixon report yeah yeah it's called the Shafer yeah so he commissioned I believe he was a governor at the time is a politician with the last name Shafer to do the study on marijuana so Shafer went ahead and did it and he found that marijuana had no real long-term negative effects on society or human health or anything like that it just was not a threat to society period Nixon the same freakin person who commissioned that report took it ripped it up and said no I'm going to amplify the war on drugs I'm gonna continue making this legal illegal I'm gonna continue criminalizing people who have simple possession of it and Nixon I mean of course he did a lot of hideous things but that had so many negative ramifications in the country that's what led to you know this explosion of the for-profit prison industry and now that industry first of all I don't know why it's called for-profit or private prisons because they're fun by tax dollars so how are they private and on top of that now we have an incentive to lock people away because these companies make money off of it it's sick yeah private prisons are very scary it's very scary that not only do you have private prisons but you have private prison lobbies and you have guard lobbies yep where prison guards make sure that certain things stay illegal so that they can ensure that they have work yeah that slaves yeah making slaves I mean you you want people to be locked up more than not locked up in my opinion if it's not robbery or violent crime those are the two things that I'm worried about robbery or violent crimes that's when you need to remove people from society everything else should be on some sort of a penalty thing yeah this demeanor citations some citing I mean what is it what's going on I mean did what did you not do did you not pay your taxes why do you get locked up for that that sounds crazy why don't you just oute taxes how about you make them pay because when you learn tomorrow night isn't making any money why are you profiting off how you doing that you're locking them up and that's better than getting money from them while they're working well we're doing the same thing with people who are undocumented immigrants right so they'll come into this country they're undocumented we find out they're undocumented and instead of deporting them which is what we used to do we will detain them for X amount of years and spend our resources on imprisoning them which doesn't make any sense at all and I get it like you you might okay we want to punish them and show them like you can't you can't do this again but you punish them by deporting them you know what I mean and and that's it like why would you want to incarcerate them and spend tax dollars on that especially when we're having this huge issue with public education right now yeah it's it's a weird little fake thing that we have going on where we pretend that la doesn't have ten million illegal immigrants we're just kind of like wow you know whatever now they're allowed to go to college at least there's a long time where immigrants were their children of immigrants or immigrants like that came over and their children were born in Mexico but live their entire lives here in America yep they weren't allowed to go to college I know so I'm happy that California passed a DREAM Act it is ridiculous that we haven't been able to do that on a federal level absolutely and disgusting what is America it's not a nation of immigrants I mean that's all we are we are a bunch of people that came here from other put into penalize a baby or to say that well you know what the parents they brought the kid over here so the kid could sponge off the kids are part of the fuckin sister yeah they call them anchor babies yeah by the way the parents are part of the system too they're working here yeah I I hate the argument that they don't pay taxes in a lot of cases especially in California I mean they pay taxes in the form of first of all they pay Social Security but then they never get a dime of that Social Security later right so they're contributing to the Social Security system and on top of that they're paying for state taxes as well or sales taxes so they do pay taxes they do contribute to society and I'm not trying to you know make excuses or to justify coming into the country illegally but if you've been here for decades and you've had your children here there we need to create some sort of comprehensive immigration reform and right now we have clowns in office that can't seem to agree on anything and refuse to work with one another so I feel like it's gonna be difficult for that to happen but I feel like something like the DREAM Act is common sense it shouldn't even be a political issue it shouldn't be a partisan issue you should just do it yeah I completely wholeheartedly agree and I think there's also this weird thing where were connected to a third world country by a fence I mean we are right next door to the biggest war on drugs in all of the world playing out on our border and then right across there you have intense extreme poverty if you take a car from San Diego you can go from La Jolla where you have the most elegant clifftop mansions that will blow your mind just these great gatsby houses we like oh my goodness like this fucking giant circular driveway with an enormous fountain you're like what a house in 20 minutes you're in Tijuana yeah 20 fucking minutes and you might just just get there while these cartel members are dropping off headless bodies and lining them up on the street with signs on them or you know you might see a brothel where you can go fuck some immigrant for a dollar that made their way up from El Salvador or Peru or you know where Mexico is the Promised Land for them they're hoping to get to Mexico living in the jungle somewhere in Ecuador I mean it's extreme intense poverty and extreme intense violence and we're just sort of like not dealing with it we're not dealing with it but we're actually fueling that type of system here in the United States by keeping marijuana illegal we certainly are by keeping marijuana legal and also through our current fiscal policy you know by allowing companies like Walmart to basically pay full-time employees so little that the government has to subsidize their health care or food stamps whatever it is just so they can make ends meet like we have we have that system here now and and we need to do something to change well it's exactly what they were protesting about during the WTO thing that goes all back to Alex Jones I told you Joe Rogan that's what he was his his document I think was 911 it was all about that it was all about how this is like an established pattern of behavior you know this Agent Provocateur thing that they do to break up peaceful protests the World Trade Organization meeting was just about that very thing is about moving jobs to these other places and figuring out a set up shop in third-world countries you can pay people dirt wages yeah yeah I don't know how that's gonna get fixed do you when you you cover this stuff on a daily basis I mean you guys are covering more serious issues and we are move are basically just fucking around and finding things in the internet that I find are interesting but you guys are like covering like some pretty legit stories and getting pretty in India do you see any light at the end of the tunnel do you see like a pot of gold in the rainbow for all this I I do see a light at the end of the tunnel but we really need a revolution and I'm not calling for violence and I'm not inciting violence but I think that there has to come a point where we hit rock bottom and the political activism actually makes a difference you know the political activism needs to exist to begin with by the way because it doesn't even exist now I mean we're at a point where the government can literally do whatever it wants and no one will make a peep out of it the NSA can spy on us the Obama administration can go drop a drone or do a drone strike on an American citizen and his 10 year old son and no one will say a damn thing about it that's the country we're living in right now our civil liberties are being destroyed our fiscal policy doesn't make sense I we need people to be politically active and we need to get money out of politics those are the two things that matter the most do you think there's also the aspect of the the amount of information that we're getting overwhelmed with on a daily basis when you think about a story about the American citizen that was targeted that was the the the Anwar El Hadi guy yeah and they killed his son with drones and you know he was an American I mean they didn't try them they just assassinated him is there too many stories coming in I mean go to cnn.com right now and you'll see a fucking million of them on the front page you know go to Yahoo go to all these news sites and you're like god damn well that's that's part of the problem but I mean most of these stories are important news stories yeah there's a lot of bullshit sprinkled in there but a huge problem is you know every American I I'm I have the luxury of keeping up with this stuff because it's my job a lot of Americans don't have that luxury because they're working 12 hour work days you know they're they're working a few different jobs just to provide for their families who the hell is gonna go home after a long day of work sit down and read all of these news stories much less understand the nuance of these news stories that's a difficult thing to do and it's a lot to ask of the American people but the way that you can fix that is by creating a media a form of media that is informative with no corporate interests because right now the gold standard of news is still the MSNBC CNN Fox News it's the stuff that you just turn on you you watch it in the background while you're trying to feed your kids and take care of your family and that's problematic because a lot of those networks will spread misinformation or they have a particular agenda and as a result they will only cover the news that fits their agenda and there's an issue with that but hopefully new media will grow to the point where it'll take over that system and it'll you know educate people enough to where they will want to stand up for their rights and they will want to be politically active I'm teaching a class at Cal State Northridge right now it's a journalism class fearful stalkers stalkers are coming I have a private security it'll be good move double up on that now and I remember when I first started teaching the class I I asked every single one of the students to tell me what they find most interesting in media what do they want to cover what's their beat and the vast majority of them were like entertainment news sports news you know stuff that's really easy to cover and very profitable so I don't blame them for wanting to do that but I wanted to instill in them a type of intellectual curiosity where they would want to know about what's going on in the political world where they would want to be these mini political activists and I don't do it in the sense that I tell them hey you got to be progressive I definitely shy away from that but I want them to look at news stories critically and question the way that they're being covered so that's like my little tiny bit of trying to make a difference and I love doing that being an instructor at a university is a very thankless job I've learned that this semester since it's my first time doing it but you got us you got to start by you know changing the way people learn about journalism changing the way they cover stories and you got to get people to be critical thinkers or at least try to inspire them to be I mean yeah really tough to get someone to do anything it is it is it is tough but I will say I open every class with a production meeting like we do mock production meetings similar to what you would do in a newsroom and the type of stories that they pitch now are very different from what they started pitching in the beginning of the semester so they're way more politically minded which I love all of a sudden they're bringing up the Glenn Greenwald Edward Snowden type stories and I'm like yes like that's a little bit of a difference and it makes me very happy do you feel like because I mean you do this for a living but do you think that you can even keep up with all the shit that's happening on a daily no no I how does a regular person you difficult it's difficult how can they I mean it's it's almost impossible to be informed today it's almost impossible I don't really informed I think I don't I don't think it's impossible I think it's overwhelming but I don't think it's impossible as a responsibility how much do you have a responsibility to be informed not you but a regular person with a regular job and a family and god forbid if you have a fucking hobby but if you're working on something yeah during the day what are the odds that you can pay attention to the top ten news stories of the day and form of really clear opinion on any of them it's very difficult we're fucked too many hours but you know what here's the thing and I'm gonna people are not gonna like what I'm about to say oh everyone loves distractions like how much time do we spend on social media how much time do we spend watching reality shows and doing things that we want to do because we just want to shut our brains off we want to numb ourselves to what's going on in the world right instead of doing that maybe we should change the culture so people will want to use that very precious time and that very precious resource to be informed they want to use it for that as opposed to being you know I think distracted problem that people have with being informed over being distracted is that it's incredibly frustrating and you feel helpless when you start reading all these stories about the stock market manipulations about the banks being bailed out and about bailouts where the fucking people that were involved in the bailout somehow or another warranted some crazy Commission they got some bonus of the gut and then the president says he's gonna limit to a half a million dollars like I'm fuckin half a million dollars a lot of money man what do you mean you're limiting it to a half of didn't we just give them a ton of money you feel helpless when you read about this shit over and over and over again you watch documentaries on fracking when you you know you read stories in the news about how how poorly veterans are being taken care of when they come back from war and there's so many different things that you read what it doesn't make sense I know but when you look at all of these news stories there's always one underlying issue in every news story it's kind of amazing and it always goes back to who is funding these politicians right if you get the money out of politics that virus if you destroy that virus things will change quickly because our representatives will be forced to pay attention to the American people the people that are voting for them as opposed to the people who are paying them you know if you get rid of that type of bribery that we're dealing with right now the entire system needs to be changed unquestionably but how does that ever happen I mean it doesn't mean we you have to let get them to change it themselves as well how else is it gonna get changed well here's the thing Congress is obviously very corrupt so Congress dare you America they're obviously very much bought by corporations and as a result it's really difficult for them to propose any real change but when it comes to the state level when it comes to state legislators it's a little different so we actually managed to get a state representative from Texas to propose a resolution for a constitutional convention it goes back to what I was saying earlier about Wolfpack and if we get you know state state representatives from all the states to agree to this constitutional convention then we can actually have this constitutional amendment to get money out of politics it's possible we just need to inform people about it wolf dash pack.com wolf dash pack.com get on it well I hope you're right and I'm very hopeful I just I think that it's incredibly difficult to get venom out of the system and that once once it's in there it's in there pretty deep it's gonna be very hard to heal this poisoned system and the people that are accustomed to extracting money they mean that's a giant part of their motivation for being in the position when they're in in the first place now all of a sudden they're there and they can't extract money anymore why kind of hippie bullshit is this all of a sudden they're gonna have to pay attention to the people that voted for them that's crazy if they get to a point where they can't do that anymore I think that's one of the things that we need is we need new young politicians I think we do actually hugely important until that happens and principled politicians I mean you'll have some Paul some candidates who will run a campaign and they're genuine in how they want to change the system I think Obama is an example of that I think he was genuine to begin with and then they enter the system and they're corrupted by what we have to deal with they're corrupted by the money in politics and I mean what are you gonna do at the end of the day you gotta you gotta run for re-election you need the funds right and you're gonna get the funds from corporations and then you have to basically get down on your knees and do whatever the corporations need you to do that's my opinion I'm with you on this but I talked to Sam Harris who I respect very greatly and his opinion is very different he believes that there's so many dangerous people in the world that Obama got into office then immediately realized how fuckin scary the world is and then started tightening down drone attacks cut cut down and survey me started to cut down on whistleblowers surveillance UPS all the things that he did once he got into office that what explains that his reversal on Guantanamo Bay he believes that it's because the stack of papers that he gets on his desk every day of memos telling him what's been avoided what how fucked up the world is what dangers were facing on a regular basis who we need to attack before they attack us that they're just trying to avoid another 9/11 I I don't know if I'm really buying that argument I think that we have this military-industrial complex and I think that Obama does not want to seem weak when it comes to national security so as a result he will do things that are extreme I mean if you're really concerned about national security it's very curious for you to go about keeping the country safe by causing so much hostility toward the u.s. think about that we are bombing and and doing drone strikes on innocent civilians abroad that creates hostility toward the United States that makes people want to attack us so I mean I I'm not really buying that you know Obama got in and he got scared I think that people are making money off what's going on abroad right now and I I think that Obama is worried about seeming weak to Republicans I mean when you look at almost all of his policies he's always been so afraid of Republicans which drives me crazy the only thing that he's really had a good stance on was gay marriage and that was after what years of being president he finally came out and said yeah I guess I've changed my mind civil unions aren't enough we should have same-sex marriage well if you really believe that then we should do something on the federal level this is not a states rights issue this is a federal issue this is a civil rights issue I feel like gay rights and gay marriage is one of those beach balls they toss up at a concert total it has to keep in the air because it keeps her distracted gay marriage oh no phone and they keep bouncing this stupid beach ball around and and politicians are now using it for political gain which is really frustrating you know what I mean it's oh look it turns out that you know the majority of Americans are in favor of gay rights so let's change our stance on that there's they're not principled and in that case it's a good thing because I want gay rights but I just politicians will be politicians you know and and a lot of them lack principle well it's always been said that they're like it's like politics or show business for ugly people and actors are notorious for sticking their finger in the air and finding out which way the wind blows culturally and then saying things that they don't necessarily believe in or necessarily have even researched and that's hugely common when you're on sets there's always these dumb bimbo actors that have opinions and males more than females bimbo males and they'll have these opinions on something political or well with the Democrats was it's like what the fuck are you even talking about like you're talking nonsense dude you just like read a front page article in salon for five seconds and now sudden you're gonna tell us what's wrong with the world yeah what they do is try to appear liberal they try to appear progressive because they're not even human but there are some weird form that like they're there like a mold that like can grab human flesh and fucking fake it and I can walk through life pretending to have regular emotions and regular feelings meanwhile they're just trying to get people to give them the next job trying to get people to like them enough to cast them in the next TV show or movie or whatever they're barely even alive they're these weirdos and I think politicians are very much the same way obviously there's a massive generalization this is not all actors I met a lot of cool actors but I have met a lot of fucking weirdos that are like Stepford Wives I like robot people they're like some weirdo who's just trying to be whatever work whatever pants work do I have to have fake rips on my jeans what what's the new thing you know should I wear a nose ring no nose rings are out I mean they're on the fucking whatever the edge is everyone's wearing what everybody else is wearing do you member when those Von Dutch hats were going around the trucker hats he knew it what are you doing yeah have a fucking stupid trucker hat on yeah everybody's got them I just thought of Ashton Kutcher anytime I think a trucker has I think of Ashton Kutcher he was young man at a time I don't fault him I think it's that sort of a thing where you get that in politics as well you get a human that's not even really a human what they are is this this this thing that's leaning towards would ever pull gravity or the wind yeah the rush of the water beneath their feet whatever the fuck it is it's pulling in one direction there's no stability there's no base is no real ethics and when they do have ethics they look fucking crazy they look like Ron Paul some some nutty dude they look like some Gary Johnson from New Mexico and fringe character well I mean I I think there have been politicians in the past who had ethics and and people will look down on them but a perfect example of a politician that actually gets a lot of respect is Elizabeth Warren if Elizabeth Warren ran for president I'd be like Hillary who you know like she's an amazing person who actually stood up to the banks when it was an unpopular thing to do and also when in this current system it's political suicide because these are the assholes that are supposed to fund your campaigns right right so Elizabeth Warren you know is an incredible senator I don't think that she's actually gonna run for president but people are becoming more and more open to principled politicians because it's refreshing it's I mean when this whole Rob Ford thing was a Ford thing was happening in Toronto there were a number of supporters because they thought that it was refreshing that he was so honest even though he's freaking crazy smoking crack yeah but they're like yeah at least he's honest all right you know maybe well yeah I did say that he smoked crack he was pretty asked about it but if you look at a guy that's that fat he's this giant moon face like he's wild these girls do anything he's so indulgent yeah look at he's doing with food look at he's doing to his body you think he scares some crack that guy's not scared of anything he'll smoke some crack yeah I I think that one of the things that this this shift that's happening with information one of the things it's gonna be very fascinating about this erosion of privacy is that you're going to get real honest politicians because they have no choice exactly you know what's amazing though is you'll have politicians that are on the record saying one thing and then like a few months later they backpedal or they say something or flip-flop and they say something completely different and they denied that they did a flip-flop and it's like like Mitt Romney is an example of that there was evidence indicating that Mitt Romney supported Planned Parenthood and then when he was running for president he's like I will shut Planned Parenthood down it's like you're on the record dude there's evidence like how are you unaware of the internet and how it holds you accountable to what you've done and said in the past well Mitt Romney is still in denial that he's a first-generation Mexican he's still in denial his family living over in Mexico remember he was talking about that like very briefly during the the campaign that his father actually was born in Mexico and everybody's like what then he get deep into and you find like oh your dad was in a sex cult oh wow Mitt Romney was a character he still is yeah yeah he was governor of Massachusetts for a long time people loved him did a good job some people love them yeah I mean fiscally he had health care in Massachusetts it's very similar to the Affordable Care Act and then he went off and started criticizing the Affordable Care Act it's like amazing to me yeah he would have fucked up as soon as he got in office - I think all of them once they get in there they just they just get taken down you know they get sat down and they they get spelled out how the world really works and they probably have hints of it before they actually get in there but once they get in there and they meet with the fucking Bilderberg Group and they meet with the international bankers that control the world's economy and they just realize the the depth of the puzzle it's probably mean that's why they all go gray like instantly oh yeah Obama is aged so much it's kind of incredible would it be amazing if he did like an Eisenhower type for like like a final speech when Eisenhower warned of the the military-industrial complex if Obama all these bomb Awards about the military doesn't know complex that would be very funny if he got on TV and just said listen I've been bullshitting you people for eight years like this system is fucking crazy move to Canada that would be moved to Hawaii I'm going back there to he never would though there I mean even though he doesn't have to worry about getting reelected again Democrats are holding him accountable they don't want to look bad because they want to make sure another Democrat gets elected and it's all it's all BS it's the same as long as our system is dealing with that virus as long as our system has the money in politics doesn't matter if you're voting for a democrat or republican it's the same at the end of the day they might be different with social issues they might be a little different when it comes to fiscal policy although Obama is not a good example of him being you know different when it comes to fiscal policy they're not different when it comes to international policy I'm a little happier when the Democrats in office because of what I think they do socially when it comes to things like gay marriage yeah things like a right to choose and they think things along those lines I feel like when when you have a Republican in office those things tend to get squashed yeah and I think that's one of the benefits of having a Democrat in office is you get more equality especially when you're dealing with a Democrat who also happens to be black I think it's good socially but then when you look at what he's done in comparison to what Bush has done its man it's real similar like it's hard to tell the difference between a Democrat and a Republican other than the health care issue it seems to be a clusterfuck but I would imagine everything that you get started from scratch as a clusterfuck I don't know why anybody would think that it wouldn't be a clusterfuck yeah I look the one thing that I just don't understand is why everyone's panicking about the website the website keeps crashing it's not worth whatever they'll figure it out it'll get the porn guys to figure it out these guys get six billion hits a day they're up that's their problem that's the problem that the Obama administration didn't think about they just hired the wrong people they should hire porn people what was the last time you went to a porn website and it crash because too many people are on it that should've never happened I'm not saying that you go to a porn website I'm saying anybody out there perverts you weirdos have you ever gone to one you found out there's too many people on the server crashed that doesn't happen they figure out how to make that work and I guarantee you way more people are going to a porn site that are going to any government site right whether it's Obama care or Medicare or whatever name the site so the the one thing that I will agree on in terms of it being a clusterfuck is only fifty thousand Americans have signed up through the the website which could be disastrous because in order for the Affordable Care Act to work you need people to sign up yeah I have doubled out of my Instagram page pitch do you that's amazing no it's not that much there's people with millions yeah more than a million on Twitter that's the most places I have my Twitter I think I have yeah you have a ton of followers on Twitter one million one hundred seventy-five thousand six hundred eighty two that's bananas I think I have like forty but I'm sure a lot of them are fake I haven't ever paid for any that are fake but there's a lot of bots out there and a lot of people that use they use fake Twitter accounts they do yeah things I don't want to do that I don't end as if I'm like a big superstar or something there's a lot of people that have done it though it's pretty common apparently it's pretty easy to do you just pay some money and they get you X amount of fake followers for I think for some people it like gives them some sort of confirmation that they're okay yeah they said he's got twenty five thousand Twitter followers he must be legit yeah that's true yeah it's so funny because you know going back to the class that I'm teaching one of my students looked me up and she's like holy shit you have all these followers and you're verified I'm like oh does that make me more legitimate now because I have like a verified Twitter account but people think it's a big deal it's really funny yeah it's big well it's big it like if someone says hey man I want to come on your podcast and I go to their page they have two hundred twelve Twitter followers I'm like bitch I've seen your show I assumed you legit okay good I didn't didn't go to your Twitter page but we can go there right now what do you got how much you got let me check this out I think 42,000 is that a lot I don't think so I think that's decent how long you been on The Young Turks oh gosh for seven years yeah that's not enough you need more quarter flowers what you know take some pictures with like you like in a bikini like looking over your shoulder you know at your but those are you she's one of those probably get that you know you don't want to do that obviously yeah screaming at me right now this is why we need feminism holes like you do you get shit for saying that you you don't like radical feminism do you ever get people angry at you for no the funny thing is a lot of people think that I am a radical feminist which I'm not well any girl that's smart as a feminist instantly did yeah it's really funny I'm I'm actually I I think the word feminism is tainted at this point and I I would much rather refer to myself as a gender equality specialist specialist whatever whatever you want to call it because look men get the short end of the stick when it comes to some serious issues women get the short end the stick when it comes to serious issues I don't like the brand of feminism that tells me that I can't be feminine I fucking hate that like I I want to wear my dresses and I want to feel sexy and beautiful and I want to push for equality you can do that those things are not mutually exclusive so that's just an example the off you look like Fred Flintstone you know like wearing makeup yeah well so I think it's one of those things where there's certain people that don't want other people behaving differently than them especially if they feel like they're being judged by the fact that you're wearing makeup and you have heels on and they don't like that then they get judged well then they start turning that at against you instead of saying look hey it's different strokes for different folks okay some people like this some people like that instead of that they look to you like you're some sort of a traitor meanwhile those same people if it was a man that was wearing makeup and wearing a dress wearing high heels they would go you go girl they would they would be happy for you because that's the progressive move if it's a transgender person that a man who became a woman and wants to wear long nails and wants to like be really dainty and feminine that's all well and groovy yeah but when a woman is dainty and exactly yeah be hilarious the argument that they'll make is well if you don't want to be objectified then don't objectify yourself not objectify I don't I don't find it objectifying just because I'm wearing something that's considered sexy doesn't mean that I'm asking people to object if I mean if people do then that's on them like it's it's kind of like saying you know if a woman dresses sexy then she deserves to get raped she should expect to get raped right no like a woman who dresses sexy shouldn't expect someone to do anything I don't think you should expect to get objectified ever and what is the world what does objectify even mean it's someone if someone is attracted to you physically are they objectifying you if they want to look at you while they have sex with you are they objectifying you like what when they find you sexy at what point what it wears the gradient like what's the spectrum where it falls into objectification to women you're not profiting off of or are you objecting oh yeah objectifying like what what where's the gray area it's a kind of a strange thing if someone likes the way you look in a dress are they objectifying you it's like how is that objectifying it's it's just a fashion sense or it's just an aesthetic it's and it's it's stupid to pretend as if women don't objectify men as well I did it the other day when I went on a hike and there was like a ton of hot guys without their shirts on like well it's I don't like that word I think it's you're admiring you're attracted to it so what is objectify you want to turn them into an object that means dehumanizing them it means removing their humanity and use them as a fuck toy but that's not what you're looking that's not that's not what you're looking to do you are physically attracted to someone and that's the first thing that stands out to you I think that it becomes wrong when that's all you see in the person right when that's all that matters to you and you know someone's level of intellect or character means nothing you know what I don't even think that's wrong I think if no I think if you're nice to each other and you just like dating people that are really pretty who gives a shit but am I supposed to be upset at you if you have dumb friends no but when you fuck dumb people I'm supposed to get a mad can't you do better maybe he doesn't want to do better yeah maybe he likes being around dumb friends maybe likes having a dumb girlfriend or a dumb boyfriend what do I give a shit I don't care what people what other people do I don't wanna be looked upon that way like I don't want people to look at me and say like oh she's just a pretty face and nothing more no one's gonna do that unless they're trying to define you I mean you know better than that how dare you that's not gonna fly yeah I think there's also an issue where people they they feel uncomfortable if they're not they're not seen as attractive and so they try to squash other things that people think are attractive they try to like they do try to belittle attempts at being attractive I mean I think that's there's an issue in that as well if there wasn't an issue in that and if you were a type of person that likes wearing Chuck Taylors and loose jeans and t-shirts what do you care if a woman is wearing a bikini right Beach what do you care if someone wears a miniskirt like how does that affect you it doesn't affect you I think you know competition jealousy all of that kind of plays a role in that as well it exposes douchebags it's excellent that you know exposes asshole man I mean yeah you put yourself in a vulnerable position if you walk around like wearing a bikini and you're walking down Main Street and you have fucking high heels on you're gonna run into a lot of weird people you kind of given them a green light to get freaky with you at least look at you baby we're in your underwear yeah that's weird what ended I think we have to Oh time of three three hours in we turn into a
