trained my dang girl rocky block my night all day well we get that champion Josie although that seems weird demands make sense it seems weird to me and then max Holloway interim champion like what is going on when you have a champion who didn't win the title in a fight in the in the Octagon he was awarded it after he won an interim title against Frankie Edgar which is beautiful performance on his part and then max Holloway wears an interim like booth with them to think about how much Holly gotta I love Mike Halloween he has nine fights in a row that he won but then he be fancy Pettis who's never fought at that wait funded long wait once before Oliveira but really not a top contender really not realistically not and then leave the weight class make fifty five and you won your belt off that yeah it's so fucking strange it's like how everyone has belt well do you think that this is just a part of the transition between Zuffa and WME and this is going to be like this transitionary period where everything about powerful Watchtower Woodleigh champs got good taste and watches the relics it's a fat one whatever it is looks good but the thing being leave that bad boy it could be an Invicta but the thing is it's like do you know there's obviously some sort of a transition going on eighty people have been fired including Goldberg right on the crazy time so I think they're scrambling for stars I think belts brings along some sort of ratings I just think they're in this feeling out there this transition period that they're just trying to figure it out and I think that's why Dana's entertaining this Conor McGregor fight because what else would we talk about name out state name something else big going on you'll see right now what's interesting is does WME are they really or you know this organization have they really been involved in anything where the outcome is totally unpredictable like combat sports because like the promotion for the holly or excuse me the Ronda fight was a perfect example of something like what we really hadn't seen it that way before we really hadn't seen it go a hundred percent heavy towards the superstar right 100% heavy usually it's like you know you would see a promo piece like say if it's like Woodley versus Wonder Boy you would see Wonder Boy highlights usually Woodley highlight - is he ass kicking on both sides you like holy shit what a fight I can't wait they didn't do that at all when they get it the way they would do a movie yes they did it the way they promote a TV show they did it the way they would promote a new Kiefer Sutherland series on Netflix is only the start but but that's when's a Netflix I should say like Fox yeah that's what scares me because Dana White when it comes to this is a genius he would never I don't think you allow that to happen so I'm just wondering how involved he is because without Dana if you just have WME running it fuck I can't look dope though I'll tell you what I don't agree with the fact they ignore I'm a I'm a purist in a lot of ways when it comes to combat sports and I think you have to respect the hierarchy of the champion I don't give a fuck who's the famous person this championship thing is so important when you have that if you're going to have champions you got to respect the champion like whoever the fuck it is it's it's super important i'ma think you make a big deal out of the fact that persons champion and they made like almost no deal out of the fact that she was a champion it was this weird situation but it was really well done in terms of like getting me amp does it well I I probably agree but for me it was for me look I did you you're the one doing the fucking problems no no no most that was not me most that was like you open up the fucking curtain the garage door you see her hit in the past I had almost nothing in that the only thing that I said is I can't imagine she's not going to come back and and be you know whatever motivated pumped up or whatever by the way a lot of stuff that using those promos totally out of context like when I was saying that she's the best ever there's no one even close there's her and as everybody else yeah it was a long time ago that was a long time crush I did not say that for this fight no I didn't say this was the place but he said that for the I think said that for the Bechet Ohio fight but yeah so see like when they're making these promos they're patching stuff they're taking so for me I have a problem that because that's not what I would say yeah so you're using like an old quote when she was dominating people versus a new quote Post head kick knockout Post the emergence of Amanda Nunez after she stops Terramax can he versus you know what you're seeing now in this division which is all this new blood coming up you're seeing this division percolate and change and and evolve and you're seeing like higher-level fighters come in like Valentina Shevchenko like Amanda Nunez like Holly Holm like you're seeing all this stuff take place in front of you seeing this change in the women's division the same way you saw a change in the men's division from 97 to 2017 you're seeing that now take place at it accelerated pace supers and the women in the women's division yes so who is dominant two years ago like to use a quote from two years ago it's really not fair I agree not at all not fair characterization yeah but it but it builds the fight up right it builds a pilot but it's not the way to do it I agree I'm appears too but the thing is is if you understand this sport and you look at let's say you want to top Eve NFL the NFL would never just focus on Tom Brady never because there's a good fucking chant yeah Roethlisberger wins next week now imagine if they just did all promos on New England people like what the fuck is this exactly it's just some bullshit well we're off those words knack and good more than that would it what you're talking about all promos that aren't the champion yeah which is worse than that right because you're talking about someone who just lost by brutal knockout they're getting a shot right away at the title and the idea is that even though they lost they lost but it was some bullshit she's now she's back back now she's back after for elimination but yes fucking 411 it's just a bad it was a lot of bad business plan there was a lot of talk by people that I don't know but I was listening to people talk about it like I don't know who they are executive type people and I was like wow you guys have this idea of how this is going to go down like they were just super super connected to this idea I don't know who they were I don't know if they're friends I don't know if but there was a lot of people that were talking that had this idea that she was just going to go in and storm the castle and take back the burger like this I had a conversation with a high up exact at a big time corporation and we're talking about a man like oh my you have no like what did he idea he we're talking about Connor and Ronda he was neither one you guys said mom had that one hiccup she will never lose again I'm like that's not true much there's a good deal no no no that she would never lose again she goes any goes in Connor not a chance like what are you talking about - these people were talking about it that memory gods are like excuse me these people were talking about stage one of them did know Newton that's his name yeah and they were calling her cannon fodder that Highland boy and everybody ignorant they don't know anything but I mean who knows who these efficient they could be I mean I don't know what they were yeah they could be people who are friends of people who know some people that work at William Morris and they're backstage dressed in fucking $2,000 suit so they look classy who knows I don't know Willy Mort they shouldn't be doing anything without going through Dana light first mmm they should not be doing anything yeah in the game way too long for you guys make any decisions without having some sort of influence from a guy who's come from the ground up from it going you can't do that listen our fan base is going to yell bullshit on this man and if we if Rhonda doesn't win we're gonna get fuckin rings Connor cannon fodder huh do you think yeah yeah that was the word someone use do you think that at this stage that there should be some sort of clearly established protocol as far as who fight to and why you have to otherwise you're no different than the WWE right then people won't take a lot of in terms titles and the championship fights area here's my argument against that Dan Henderson and Michael Bisping I wanted to see that fight it was goddamn times we loved and I great love Dan and I love Mike and I will die no Mike wanted it back he finally got the title he's like fuck this I don't want to look like that guy knocked me out he's got a fucking picture of him flying through the air I went ahead that's his long out cold see everybody knows what that logo is yeah he's like fuck him he landed it to Wystan them in the fight so don't you run that might be fuzzy that's up there but I think you have to have some sort of structure where people can see what's going on otherwise it's just like maybe it's like a you saw an exemption yeah baby I'll exempt rock Lesnar you got away with money long as you do that you're right you miss out on this really fun kind of revenge yes yes look put then to put then you can't say oh we want to be the next NFL we have to be the NBA do you think I mean outside of like promoters you see the thing is you can't and it's weird it's like are you a sport where someone has a very clear you know like like the world series but you can't like someone can't lose a game and then all sudden be in the World Series right it's just like there's no there's a protocol like you have to go through that protocol I'm getting Susie but do you think the deers are possibly like you could have something like that some established set up but then they could throw it to the internet for like a wild card can't happen cannot happen like every now and then plan is maybe the UFC gets three wild cards a year oh god oh my problem is the people haven't answered that thing but here's the other thing I wonder is Saturday young Jamie shaking his head doing it okay or that how important voting for the all-star team is shipment that's how y'all Ming is the number one year every year but because Chinese people is more of them well technically yes but let me know as they do it online yeah right now that's the number one forward for the Warriors but like no one knows even now to say his name from China name is Josh up with Julia but he's going to use the leading vote-getter here Jimmy Lin to wait in front of good no idea yeah Josh up I don't know what's the waiting let me but let me ask you this question about a memento your point here's a question of mootness do you think I wonder just about MMA whether being champion in most of the divisions is even that important to the fans in other words oh yeah when the whole bill is what's important to people is Conor McGregor right Ronda Rousey the people that have to cut there's something colorful about them complicated people somebody who speaks well so we we watch those guys but I'm not so sure that because Michael Bisping is champion that his viewership goes up it does for sure does not automatically proven champion fight sir Kevin point terrible point and you know what I need you to take a break after I to your point out you can say Ronda was the bigger so but Rana was a different force and reason she got so big is because she's champion Ronda was never champion when I don't know like what shoes did she was winning one reason one it doesn't matter what she did to indulge that whole popularity thing was very different than Connors approach if Connor decided to take that exact same approach and go do a ton of movies you know to a ton of talk shows and go do a ton of you want to Marshallese meal advisors and entourage and all this different shit if he started doing that same shit his star would rise proportionally to weigh her star Oh's and his performances inside the Octagon would suffer proportionally to where hers did and he didn't do it he still bigger we were talking about that guy that did that interview he's a sports guy and he was talking about none of the other guys the black guy who was with um shin sharp said of him yeah and he had a great point Shannon Sharpe had a great point and he said Ronda cheated on MMA he said you've got to be small in and goes you can't go and do a bunch of other shit and think you're just so much better than everybody else it's never going to catch up it comes from another one-percenter athlete who knows exact impatiens yeah shannon sharpe stuck to the game she didn't - said it when he said it I was like this guy's dead right I think it did not although the only problem the business model is that it was MMA it's really hard to invest in the champion because of the nature of the sport the belt will chant like especially you're investing it for wildlife right but the earlier I change but you're not investing for in the champion you're investing in the organization and the fact that they have the best fighters in the world what you're doing with each fight is promoting a fight what I'm saying is that you have to respect the hierarchy of the championship above all the champion is the champion and if you don't respect the hierarchy of the champion if you're somehow or another saying that this champion ain't shit unless this champion is fighting Mike fucking Tyson when Tyson was 20 years old and just smashing everybody and you knew oh my god that's going to be the youngest ever heavyweight champion then you focus on that guy with the same amount of fervor that it demand right but that's not the case here you know you're talking about an insanely you look in that particular Ronda Rousey fight an insanely dangerous champion yeah who just smashed Mesa Tate and anytime I the next factor we're like we really don't know what we're going to get sexual progress and put all the money in yeah so you got getting say you've got but also you have an insanely marketable champion first of all the first-ever openly gay women's MMA champion and man it should never been an openly gay MMA champion so you have the whole LGBTQ whatever they are now a journey that's about a payoff you're like a baby look whatever you people that but you have also a bunch of people that respect that and a progressive people that say hey this is great like look it shows how diverse the UFC is sure and we should always amaze yeah and the stupid shit that Meryl Streep said the other day like one of the reasons why she probably said it she's seeing Ronda Rousey's face plastered all over the plate in the face the place and she's saying hey you know you take with foreigners out of Hollywood you're going to be left with football and MMA she doesn't understand that MMA like you saw tonight with Yair Rodriguez is 80% foreigner yes it's so wrong about that and that's also art that's that jumping spinning back-kick would be art come on that you tell me that 360 round kicks like and when I dance but harder she's got a rocker with it yes it's just like rhythmic gymnastic hell yes she just doesn't know yeah educated I mean if dance is an art then gymnastics in competition is also an art because it's very similar it's just under more pressure right so if gymnastics is an art how the fuck is how our 360 round kicks not oh shit that guy on the ground is a little a bad motherfucker hey it's weird she use your lifetime of Gian Award to talk shit about MMA in football well I think she was making a clumsy larger point yes for sure celebrate what you know it was nina a rock your crime no need in sarf 1 whoa rear naked round 3 that's a man in nuna's his girlfriend holla [Music]
