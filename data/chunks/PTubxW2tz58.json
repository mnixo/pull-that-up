do so I was looking at this video today of this dude jumping this cliff in his bike like Jamie was showing this one guy who does this on buildings he does it like he he rides his bike on like the ledges of buildings and shit and jumps from building to building and I was watching this other guy jump this cliff with his bike like literally jumps over one side of the cliff and lands on to the other it's fucking like you're watching the whole thing you don't Jesus Christ if he falls he's dead he's fucking dead that's it's totally legal right like we're talking about people thinking that MMA is barbaric that it should be illegal like where should be you be allowed to take your risks look at this fucking guy this guy's crazy dude look at this shit hopping from building to building and he's riding a bike on the edges of these buildings this is fucking insane this guy's got just ridiculous control of this bicycle I mean should this be legal I don't know seems like he's doing okay he's fine but if he fucks up like you know about that Chinese dude that just died no he was one of those YouTube guys that would take videos of him I heard about the skyscrapers and shit and he fell he fell to his death damn yeah dude it looks ugly to look scary like he was trying to claw himself up and he couldn't then you see his hands slip and you realized that's a wrap son Oh 600 feet I had a friend who was training to be a BASE jumper and there's like things you got to do you know so many regular skydiving jumps you got it you got a master skydiving and just that before you get into and then there's things you have to do there's I could listen halfway through too many people died in the scene or this person just stepped back and said you know what maybe yeah cuz it's not that uncommon were these crazy base jumpers died or almost died right yeah there's a lot of videos there's one I saw that was awful this Russian guy jumps off the top of this building his parachute doesn't open up in time and he bounces off the ground and you hear him screaming OH how about that one guys what do they call that they'll call it BASE jumping but they're like flying squirrels yes that my friend Andy's the world-record holder Andy stomps the world-record holder he flew what was it 18 miles I think he covered 18 wins that Kyle's is it's a flying wing suit yeah yeah but there's one guy that's super famous for doing it too and he was supposed to go through you know they go down Cannes and he went between two rocks and like his leg yeah and then like fuck he didn't die though which is crazy you know the one guy that did die on the Golden Gate Bridge you ever see that one he slammed right into the bridge while people were watching him he was supposed to go between the wires Oh hit the bridge she jumped off a plane crazier like he hit it like like a bullet nobody jumped off a plane and then went flying down and tried to go through that I don't know where he jumped off of I don't know if he jumped off of a plane or he jumped off of another bridge I don't know what he did but when he was trying to do it he literally slammed right into the bridge and it sounds like a crazy car accident like bang how long ago was that no few years back this is all shareit give us some volume Jamie yeah wasn't Golden Gate but San Francisco which bridge was it it's horrible dude Oh who's that in their parachute that's another guy he was he was flying with another guy oh my god dude fuck it sounded like there was a bunch of people there watching - or - but this is that should you will be allowed to do that I don't think you should be able to tell someone they can't do something right and why should you be able to why what if what if they just start influencing so many young kids to do it and there's all these kids dying all over the place then do you make it illegal man that's a good question well then do you make war illegal you can't do that right how are we supposed to eat like what sport when does it become too dangerous like a what like soccer people apparently some of them get brain damage from heading the ball apparently you're not supposed to head things like that and they do it all the time to practice they start developing traumatic brain injuries they get CTE from head-butting a ball sweet unit so that may be more dangerous than wrestling yep you know but there's no way I mean people talk about trying to make it illegal cuz it's barbaric there's no way you're gonna make MMA illegal it's too late I think so too but it's interesting when people start rallying for more regulation for people's behavior its voluntary behavior what's the latest is there some new thing no I just read some article was just something on MMA being barbaric and I'm like yeah it is it's a lot of things are you know we like a lot of things that are fuckin super dangerous and but there's something about like agreed-upon violence like you trained for six weeks he trains for six weeks you both get into a cage together and we all watch it screaming monkey well we know that in football some guys get Lou Gehrig's disease right sure I mean Steve Smith remember the guy from the Raiders he was on an HBO special I think kinds of brain issues does that happen in in the night not like that I don't think not yet but you got to think of the long history of football football you're dealing with guys who played in the 50s 60s right yeah this guy was played on the Raiders like in the early 90s or Steve Smith I think well we have a few guys like that right we have Gary Goodrich fought in the UFC in 93 or 94 remember he doesn't have Lou Gehrig's nobody's got some serious CTE he's been real open about it does a lot of interviews about it it's on a bunch of medication he said actually the real damage came when he started doing k1 yeah but you know they can't be surprised though I mean no Big Daddy was in some fucking wars yeah remember you got head came by I don't mean by about Gary Goodridge I mean about everybody you don't have if you have you fight for 10 years and you don't come out with some significant brain damage you're fucking lucky you're in a story where your brain is the target you're trying to fit everyone's trying to figure out ways they're lifting weights they're doing kettlebells so that they could hit your brain even harder they're learning technique so that it's perfect so that when it hits your fucking brain it just knocks you the fuck out crazy that's the sport that is the sport so no one should be surprised you can't be but you can't be surprised like you know what was that guy's name Tony Conigliaro is that what the guy that got hit with a baseball the guy got hit with a pitch when I was in high school I think in Boston I was still I still liked baseball like you know I found Taekwondo because a baseball went to a baseball game and passed by the Taekwondo studio because the line for the T was really long to get on the public transportation so he said let's just go up there and watch and so we walked up the stairs and this guy john lee was a US national hit light heavyweight champ was kick in the back and he was kicking the back so hard i was like holy shit i want to figure out how to do that that's a movie right there that's huge I was walking up the stairs and I heard on pump chink chink and the cheek was the chains of the bag just chink cuz he had this 150 pound bag flying through the air dude I came up and I watched him kick that thing and I was like I gotta learn how to do that like that it's crazy how could he do that but the guy who was famous in Boston from when I remember when I was in high school was this guy Tony see Tony Conigliaro and he was hit with a pitch and became like you know disabled he got hit in the head in 1967 I guess there goes a Revere need it was a rising star with the Red Sox oh I'm Way later than this so I must have been just here and everybody talked about it but you know that can happen your story about the first time you know considering how extraordinary your sidekicks are that story just so strong so where did that shit come from it came from the my instruction for sure but that story how crazy that story you're going to a baseball game and you hear these claw claw or you you end up going at Tai Kwan DOS school because of why why don't you go to baseball game again well we went to the baseball game you know everybody leaves the Fenway Park so the line for the train was fucking huge so everybody's getting on the tee so we were kids just hanging out yeah I couldn't drive back then I was like 14 almost 50c this Taekwondo school yeah I knew it was there cuz I had always looked at martial arts schools cuz I wanted to go to one for a long time but I looked at him from the yellow pages like who has the biggest had a big out of the yellow pages are like ah that must be the spot man that's the spot when I was a kid right next to our neighborhood McDonald's was a karate studio and man I was as poor as poor can be I mean we didn't have any money so but on Fridays when my mom would get paid we'd go to we'd go to McDonald's that was our that was like we're celebrating thank God Friday she got a $150 check she's taking her kids to McDonald's and every time we went to McDonald's I'd always look over at the karate studio and just think man I wish I was rich I just wanted to do karate I remember one time it's just like a scary studio and it looked cool it was right it was in Santa Ana on bristol and 17 right there it may still be there I drove by the other day didn't drive by that that tell the story about how your instructor pretended he went to China this podcast is too big for that can I do it without saying his name oh yeah don't don't say his name you know I don't want to bring it okay whatever hey man back in the day does the people did you know there's a lot of guys that got by with some fake martial arts there was a lot of fake stuff out there and that's why I think to this day like if I hadn't walked up those stairs I could have went to some bullshit school I took karate for like one lesson or maybe two at the most before that at Joe Esposito's karate Academy which is a really good spot it was in my city too but there was no good public transportation methods it was too hard to get that's too hard to get in here at 13 14 yeah I was 14 so then a year later is when I wound up walking up those stairs and hearing that bag going that's a movie right that's a cartoon definitely that he was training for the World Championships he was training he was a national champion at the time say hey and he was changing for the World Cup where he took bronze so he was like top of his game this guy John Lee he taught me a lot of shit too he taught me a lot like a black guy big tall thin black guy who wound up um he was having a substance abuse problem he was a national Taekwondo champion he was a bad motherfucker dude he kicks so hard but he wasn't the head instructor that's known it wasn't Maria know you had a Korean dude a natural curry and an American dude named Michael O'Malley who spent the most time with me he spent the most time with who was the main instructor the Korean Kim the Korean guy who he was trained about general chaeyoung Yi who's the founder of Taekwondo oh yeah so he was like one of a very small elite he was like like hems Oh Gracie in a way yeah but what the difference is they they emphasized a power style whereas as it got more and more competitive guys realized with that chest protector on the best style for scoring is like really quick kicks that don't have as much power but you score and you win tournaments like that and so the game changed and the kicks changed because it's like to throw a kick that's hard you have to plant yourself and it does take a little bit more time it takes a little bit more time so it's better to spend more time on just getting points yeah in a lot of the Taekwondo tournament's cuz those guys were really good and they knew how to play that game so well they were so fast with their legs but then we just touch you they were just some thought and some guys we kick harder than others but the whole hard style of the early taekwondo was kind of missing in a lot of their approaches because they were just trying to win and if you really like dug in and try to kick hard a lot of times those guys without score you you know we tell you d like really fast really skillful guys but then when you apply that to fighting fighting the real problem is like in fighting fighting you have to land hard shit cuz people are not just gonna play taekwondo with you they're gonna try to take you down they're gonna try to kick your legs they're gonna try to do a bunch of shits all that flippy-flippy shit that flippy-flippy shit you got to make a hard transition whereas like muy Thai guys Muay Thai guys didn't fucking dig it everything's digging they're fucking driving into everything everything they're trying to blast you with you know they're doing it skillfully but there's emphasis on power through the whole thing so when they would fight if a Taekwondo guy fought a Muay Thai guy and it's happened many times Taekwondo guys are fucked they're fucked they just get their legs kicked out from under it's like good can't laugh it's the same thing with leg locks and jiu-jitsu it's the same thing cuz when when everything is legal in jujitsu and everything's legal man legs become like the most important thing because there you don't have to sweep you know if chokes are the most important then you got to do a lot of shit before you could you gotta pass this guy first you got to sweep and then you gotta pass this card then you got to get us back you got to do so much shit before getting into his neck a lot of the times most of the times with leg locks he Lenina doing me that shit you just need to jump right on them they're right there you don't ever need to sweep anybody you don't ever need to pass anybody's guard you could just go legs 100 percent and roll with the pure jiu-jitsu guy and wreck them you could do that that happens all the time let the legs the leg game when everything is legal the leg game that's the first fight yes the first fight you have to do whether you like it or not you have to deal with it if you want the net okay you're gonna have to deal with this leg war right now because it you can't get to the neck unless you could deal with that you're gonna go around the forest the leg locks you're gonna go fucking right through you know so but you take leg locks out of the game make them illegal then it becomes a whole different sport it's totally different yeah it's exactly what you're talking about with the power shots and the point shots yeah it's all exactly what we're talking about worth like the style of MMA now is almost always attacking the legs everybody attacks the legs did you see those on just now yeah joe says for real at once yes for real striking is better than ever oh the fuck ever did that to Robbie Lawler who just outclassed Robbie Lawler who the fuck did that nobody ever did that he's not driving Robbie Lawler never really should at the end he kind of showed that his legs were done right at the very end he's gonna want a fucking animal he took it the whole way I mean you could see but really can you see it by he was he kind of like he wasn't moving well and he was definitely more stationary yeah he was just taking out his leg and it that that leg kick isn't it crazy I was just talking to somebody crazy that did more people don't strategize to use that right to wear down the legs you would think yeah in so many fights it's never like one of the main strategies I think that low leg kick is changing the game I really do remember when Steve a fought jr. and his legs swole up like a fucking balloon like almost immediately Urijah Faber yeah fought Jimmie Rivera Jimmie Rivera fucked them all over the world more people don't focus on that I think doing it more and more now man I think but it's crazy as it's a pretty recent I I credit it to Benson Henderson Henderson was like the first guy I ever saw do it you started doing it like really regularly and I was like hmm like I don't like really high level guys like world championship level guys Benson Henderson was the first guy to do it I was like I like that that's fuck and I talked to Duke Rufus bad he's like it's like just taking the legs out no lower leg kicks lower like hitting the shins Oh everybody's there attacking the inside of your leg like in your calf your lower calf and the outside devastating it fucks the nerves up like your legs give out you see a Ricky riah's fight with with Jimmie Rivera Rivera just constantly chopped at that leg and you ride his leg became like almost useless you can't walk on it I was just talking about straight leg kicks down oh that too for sure just a regular old kick right above the knee yeah right you know well you know what here's another thing too man those Bruce Lee kicks those oblique kicks that a lot of guys are using you know those those are fucking legit man they blow your knees out I mean they slam into your thigh and they blow your fucking knees out and you know a lot of people don't like it they think it's nasty but look you're trying to kill each other with your bones that's getting your knife low way that would come up when dudes are trying to do like flying knees like those dos Anjos that never flying these or what do you call those skip knees or Swiney yeah he goes he uses that first need to propel that second knee Pam he also did why you have to block that first knee you got to react to that first mean it helps a second me get in there yeah you see that knee coming at you you're gonna you're gonna react in that second knees that should be something that you'd seem way more off yeah that should be an if you're trying to get in the UFC and you're not adding as many different weapons cons you can't add them all at once so you take the most important ones you know you and your one two and your leg kick and maybe a head kick and then you slowly obviously you wouldn't you would just add them but you should be if you're making a living in the UFC or or that's your goal you should be always working on adding a new strike to the mix and you know something that you master something and this camp we're gonna focus you got to always be it's just so hard to get really good at one thing while you're doing everything you know that you got to kind of do focus on the basics and then do 20 minutes a week you know you're just working on and overtime over the time will fly and you spent 20 minutes a week on a new technique it's not it's gonna within six months it's gonna be something that you've mastered maybe a year if you're consistent with it you could just keep doing that you just keep adding another one add another one especially with all that's available its striking it seems like the days of just going out there boxing and throwing a leg kick every now and then like that's only gonna get you so that that's like it's not doesn't seem like it would be the smart thing to do to not constantly add weapons I agree with you and I always say like boil it down to the what's the best in each genre and arguably one of the best striking arts if not the best is Thai boxing right muy tight and you don't see anybody just winning Muay Thai with boxing they don't just go over there and just box it'll fucking nobody just act they go over there and you tie box yeah they kicked each other they elbow they use the clinch they throw elbows they're not trying to like doing Mike Tyson in there they get their legs chopped out from under them yeah if both guys know how to box the guy who knows how to box and kick your legs is gonna have a big advantage yes I mean it's just it's I don't I don't think there's hardly anybody that's going over to Thailand and just trying a box Muay Thai fighters it's terrible idea and there's so much more to that is what I'm saying yeah inside yeah all that if you're really good at just really good so good that your training camp has to address it and use valuable time to address and train against that you already got him off balance yeah like when I was in George Sadr Opelousas Corner when he fought dennis siver that was a part of the training camp we had a deal with Dennis severs turning sidekick mmm-hmm he was laying people out with that turning sidekick he's done it he's it's still to this day if he can still throw it and if he lands it you're probably gonna get knocked out he's probably one of the best so that throws that draws your it's game off he's got to constantly worry about that instead of not having to worry about that of if I dennis siver had all the rest of the skills but you just deleted that turning sidekick then you wouldn't really have to focus on that much yeah you could focus more on yourself and your game plan and how you're gonna impose your game plan like fuck really what he's doing but when you have something real dangerous like that like with Edson Barboza mm-hmm he's got that turning that spinning wheel kick that he's knocked out a few people with right at least two he said the first wheel kick knockout ever in the UFC how many does he have at least two or three right a couple I don't know he said the first guy ever in the UFC also that has two stoppages my leg kicks yeah that's you got a watch you got it that throws your whole game off well you got to worry about him throwing some Grand Slam striking his kicks are so scary he's the fastest kicker I've ever seen as far as his switch kick you never seen a guy throw a switch kick like at some carbo's it just gets in there so fast you're like what the fuck man yeah yeah that he's fighting nurmagomedov holy shit oh shit that's gonna be a crazy number xxx you should go crazy once you come to that one Vegas come see that shit live it's a tough you got a family it's just go I'm gonna go to Vegas with my buddies you know it's it's a different life you know that fight is I love it I don't I never go to Vegas ever again I wouldn't give up you know I don't I've been so much that I'm good for the rest of my life seriously I really am I think you'd want to go back every now and again just do it you feel that we're gonna do an e bi in Vegas a May 5th in Vegas and is it May 5th before the UFC no it's on a Saturday now I don't know if there's not a UFC on the same day but um yeah it's gonna be um we're gonna have a a combat jujitsu match between Gordon Ryan and Vinny Michael and holy shit oh my god crazy yeah yeah do you we don't we don't normally do super fights and EBI because we take all the purse money that we have available in our budget we put it towards the winner the winner take all in the tournament we don't have extra money for additional super fights but this one we had to figure out a way to make it happen it's gonna be nuts to Gordon Ryan against Vinnie magallanes any combat GG the next big thing it really could be the next big thing because as far as like preparation jujitsu preparation for MMA without kicking and punching and needing standing up it's the best preparation yeah for sure you there's a bunch of different ways to look at it um an MMA purist might say what the fuck is this combat jujitsu it's laughs we'll just watch MMA like what's the point you know people can say that easily but the way I look at it it's it's nothing is as good as the UFC though you have that's the best there's nothing better than the UFC but there are jiu-jitsu fanatics that they just want to see jiu-jitsu in the UFC they're really not that into a kickboxing match if you know Junior dos Santos fights Cain Velasquez and it's a kickboxing match great there'd be an all-time great match to watch but there's a there's a group of jiu-jitsu fanatics that they're just that's right they just want to watch the jiu-jitsu but with the strikes and that's the ole in MMA is the only place where you could watch anime jiu-jitsu there's a it's a totally different style when you watch just pure Jiu Jitsu that's not I'm a man too Jitsu has nothing to do with them if people that don't do Jiu Jitsu they listen to this like what are they talking about there's places where you've gone for a submission but someone could easily hit you in your face and it makes the move kind of unrealistic there's a lot of times where guys do unrealistic things and really you could just be smacking them in the face and they would have to stop and protect themselves yeah when you're doing jujitsu without strikes it's just pure Jiu Jitsu you get into a lot of positions that that would be dangerous and if strikes were allowed so which is fine you know Jiu Jitsu I love submission oh yeah I need to and it's just a different thing it's just you need to understand what it is I mean it doesn't mean that you shouldn't do that move if it's that's the most effective move in though that rule set yeah but there's a beautiful place for combat Jiu Jitsu yeah because now we could we could watch jiu-jitsu fanatics it's just for Jiu Jitsu freaks we could watch and I made you Jitsu and it's just pure Emma made Yujin so we don't have to sit through the striking because we in MMA if the fight gets boring on the ground we have stand ups in combat jiu-jitsu after two minutes standing we have get down we get them down just like in wrestling yeah and get them down it's like now after two minutes no one cuz if we had a ten minute or 15 minute combat you get to match and they were just standing and wrestling the whole time that matches shit it's garbage yeah that match nobody wants to see that nobody's just wrestle trying to wrestle for for ten minutes so after two minutes as horn sounds a coin gets tossed and if you lose if you win the coin toss you get to decide top or bottom when we start and sit up garlic butterfly guard with double underhooks you get top or bottom in that position I'm gonna start right there and then if they stand up again two minutes so that's a new thing - I'm gonna get down clock yeah when did that start we did that I like it we did that right at combat jiu-jitsu worlds because that would ruin the show I just I constantly am thinking of ways to to ruin the show like how can I ruin it of course if they just stand up and wrestle the whole time and that's gonna happen in combat jiu-jitsu they're not gonna pull guard as much as in sub only people are pulling garlic all over the place it's like people are just tumbling and then there's no strikes and they're all over they're all over each other's legs and they're just pulling guard and flipping and doing all this stuff that when they're strikes when their strikes boom it just we get into full guard now yeah then we get out amount becomes very important mount is you could win a million bbi's and never mount a guy you know you could just be a leglock fine and you could you don't have like full guard it was a Waggoner Rocha and Nathan orchard yes yes that was combat jiu-jitsu world's won the winner of the lightweight bracket was Vagner Rocha he beat Nathan orchard in the finals it was he the only got to stop somebody that was the first TKO yes he mounted Nathan orchard and referee Mike Beltran stopped the action it was a good start to what Ragnar is a very accomplished MMA fighter yeah so so again my point with them in jiu-jitsu without strikes full guard totally unnecessary you could win Abu Dhabi ten years in a row and never put anybody in you're full guard so if you never want to play full guard ever in regular jiu-jitsu with out strikes you never have to play full go to just open up your legs and you just get into some Z or some kind of spiral della heave or whatever you never it's totally optional you know most people don't even bother with it Kron Gracie he does he loves full guard you know whether their strikes or not that's why it's full guard and MMA is very effective because he always played full guard in his regular Jiu Jitsu without grappling so it what happens with Jiu Jitsu is you add strikes in an MMA match or in a combat you get to match it's the same thing when strikes are added now full guard becomes the most important guard it was the least important guard in grappling now it becomes the most important guard so if you weren't playing full guard when you were doing jujitsu without the strikes and now you're doing jiu-jitsu with the strikes guess what that's that's the guard it's gonna be the most important one when a guy could smack your head yeah control posture yes full guard yes yeah so control posture yeah and again and sub only you don't ever have to mount ever you never have to pass the guard but in combat Jiu Jitsu now the mount becomes super powerful cuz now you can mount and strike and sub only if you mount you can't strike you know you I like mounting and sub all that but you don't have to you can get caught in leg locks if the guy has a good mount escape right into leg locks that's what usually happens most leg lock masters are very good at letting dudes mount them and then they buck them off and right when they escape they're already on the legs lot of leg lockers do that and you know but when they're strikes you're gonna let a dude mount you now now that he could because in a strike you now it's a big difference now the mount from Jiu Jitsu with no strikes to Jiu Jitsu with strikes combat jujitsu the mount just turns into this monster well it does but what's really interesting is you're only allowing slaps think about how much more of a monster dude aren't slapping them says you're not allowing elbows no I'll give you loud elbows yeah then it's exactly yeah depends on depends on what kind of guard you're dealing with a depends on who's in the guard I mean but like if you allowed the back to be taken and you allow two elbows would you go to what we've always said you said this a long time ago that if you had elbows if elbows were allowed to the back of the head mm-hmm they would change the whole back mouth you ain't nobody go on for reneging jokes you would just get the back and just elbow the shit out of there they're the back of their head and the fights over that's what was happening early in MMA before they outlawed those elbows they used to be legal for like a couple years remember the world combat whatever the fuck it was we're hens Oh Gracie fought that guy was his name the judo guy yeah I want to say Speicher yes yes I can Speicher yeah the judo guy had called him in his hotel room all through the middle of the night fuck woman and he got so pissed that when he choked the guy out he smashed him in the back of the head and then stepped on his neck as he walked off well he took it he didn't chuck him out he took his back right he tapped him with strikes didn't he or did he choke him I don't remember we smashed him I'm not sure how he finished him but I do remember him standing up and stepping on his neck yeah stomped on it see if you could find that video you got the video of the stoppage is horrific but this is the perfect example of how effective elbows to the back of the head are once you take the back mount so like part of me I said yeah James I was a bad mother fuck or do people forget he's still down the throat fuck yeah yes look at that look at this back mount and then oh yeah Osen any choke so he did get the choke those fucking shots worth though that's he's tapping right there and Henzell keeps holding on to him even after he chucked him what the game yeah and now watch it gets off of him and steps on his neck and so that guy's fucked up and that's from those elbows man that position changes radically look at he's trying to pick him up and Joe just rolls him over on the back that is hilarious man that was a big mistake one Aggie Oh huge mistake wearing Aggie with a guy like hens oh you know everything and you don't have it and he doesn't have a game that becomes even warm it's easier to get rear naked choke says we're allowing you know you got rise back you could palm the side of their head well it's also the chahti like if you have elbows to the body remember when rampage stopped Chuck Liddell with L elbows to the body people get about that in pride elbows to the body a guy really knows how to throw an elbow that's nasty you know I mean combat jujitsu you're opening up the door what you're doing is like you're opening up this door letting jujitsu guys understand like the where the positions were there be vulnerable yeah but that's going to take the kind of damage that they would in an MMA fight exactly so exactly yeah a great great pathway it's it's a few things on on a few different levels it's it's great for grapplers whether they're wrestlers or jujitsu players to get into if they're aspiring to be an MMA fighter yeah also guys that have done 30 40 fights and they're like dude this is just too brutal guys coming out of MMA it's a great place for him because generally the you know before combat jujitsu all MMA fighter had to retire to if he wanted to keep competing and grappling is like sub-only or the points game and if you're not working on that every day you know they're the last 10 years that were working on striking most of their time and and the purest like the pure sub only guys to like lot guys and the pure points players they're working on that every day to win those styles whether whether it's to win the points tournaments or the sub only insurance those the athletes that are winning those titles they'll work on every day so when an MMA fighter retires he's not gonna really want to go into sub Ali's like do and I'm just so far behind they don't want to do it but now with combat jujitsu 99.9% of the people that flooded me with I got a long list of people that want to be in combat jiu-jitsu they're all MMA fighters I'm sure no walking tomorrow them no pure jiu-jitsu guys only one really only one only one and that's been Eddie he's my brown belt from tenth plant of San Diego he's he was he trained with Danny at first then he started training with Gio and boogie down in San Diego he's a brown but he had a combat jujitsu match with Wilson Hayes well combat jujitsu world and Benanti probably has top two guards in the world Wow the ends if you end up and end up in this fool guard It's A Wrap he does a Hindu load T need to plays rubber guard way different than me we have totally different styles of rubber guard it all starts off with either like a meat hook or mission control but from there everyone's gone it's so vast now and he does a leg in guillotine I've seen him do low teen it's the craziest don't worry she grabbing it there were like four guys on the planet that could do this it's it's incredible it's like it's just how is he grabbing it that's a good question you know I've never done it I know how to do it but I've never actually I don't have the flexibility for people think that people think that I'm super flexible Mike I'm not been flexible I just I'm pretty flexible but I'm not that flexible I just use it a lot so it appears that I'm really flexible cuz I'm always using it so yes but a lot of people couldn't do what I do and where and way beyond as well in Benanti his flexibility is insane and he he had a single match with them Wilson Hayes put him in his guard and he chopped him with the dead orchard you know I have a problem with people when it comes to the subject of flexibility because I feel like there's this conversation that people have when it comes to flexibility they say you could only get so flexible like some people just and so what yeah that's not sure I don't agree with it either I think there's there's there's like attention and focus to stretching that some people just don't want to give what I want to know though is to get to the contortionist level can anybody get to the contortions fella can you trained someone to do those crazy you know when people like they bend their back all the way back and they get into like a scorpion trying to suck your own dick maybe why you gotta bring up or just don't you can anybody trained to be a contortionist that's what I wonder now I'd like to see like before and after type like vlogs right I look good Joey Diaz on it I don't know about being a contortionist I don't know that everyone can go that far but all you need to play rubber guard is to get into full Lotus and anybody can do that unless you have like metal plates in your heads or say contortionists are skilled at scratch stretching their bodies into different shapes mostly due to their spinal flexibility and strength you may think that you need to be born flexible or double-jointed to become a contortionist but in fact with enough practice and stretching you can learn basic contortion movements hmm I feel like stretching is one of those things where people just aren't willing to dig in and really like feel that that that like borderline edge every day they don't like that feeling it hurts it's uncomfortable like certain stretches like it's hard to breathe like we do hamstring stretches it's like it's hard to breathe ya know yeah but you know some I think that everyone is born flexible like I think all babies can get into full Lotus I just think that some people keep using it and some people don't I always thought because people would ask me why are you flexible and I just thought I thought it was because you know I was super insecure as a child and I still AM but I would put my legs behind my head to like you know like this is my trick right know what I mean so I thought that's why I'm flexible cuz I was always trying to show off by putting my legs behind my head maybe it is but when you think about it I didn't show off like all the time do a few times but then but then my mom came over the house once and saw my son biting his own toenails because oh look just like you and you were a kid he's O's and then I thought that's right is the trim my even though I got 10 11 and 12 I used to trim my toenails with my mouth couple freak toe suckers yeah I don't know anymore but as a kid I did it all the damn even with dirt I would like a six you know when you bite you'd bite the toenail laughs but has dirt and you can feel the crunch in the rindy crunchy yeah oh it's my foot just dirt that's true that's your foot yeah I've done it with my fingernails like why am I so prejudiced about my toes like what if my feet are clean but to do the hindu low team like Benanti you have to I mean I when I come back after my surgery I'm gonna have knee surgery Mike how are you going to get your knee surgery with I'm gonna have a doctor I'll talk to uh we'll talk about it afterwards I got some options for you I do have a doctor you do yeah okay cool dr. Ron in Beverly Hills he's a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt he are dr. Rob is it better go to the right door yeah is this the Hindu lateen here it is yeah check out what he's doing around the back of the head oh wow so he goes like right over his ankle that's Hindu control few people just listening he's got his leg wrapped over the back of his opponent's head and then he's wrapped his arm around the ankle area and he's going all the way around the dudes heading under the chin my little t-rex arms couldn't do that dude I'll have enough real estate I don't think I could get in there I'd have to like really compress to go through it yet he's doing it right now this is something I think that people should watch though look at that this is he does it he's done it twice an e bi Wow in one show that's crazy I just look at him work so we're watching him set this exact thing up that he was just talking about wow that's awesome but yeah he's gonna fight for the belt EBI Kombat Jiu Jitsu belt that is currently held by Nick hone Stein he's fighting Benanti at the next EBI at the mussel farm HQ in Burbank yeah yeah mussel farm moved to Burbank right when did they decide to do that the CEO is from LA he just wanted it here they were in 5,500 feet above sea level before in a city that's a pretty rare thing to have like to be at a mile like Denver's very unusual and that you are at high altitude but you have a badass city you know you fucked up kids but but it's awesome to the facility I'm sure they throw they throw a fuckload of money at that stuff so far they had a fight to win show there and that was awesome that was like maybe three weeks ago it was was awesome the places is spectacular so we're doing a show there Saturday February 17th EBI 15 gos in it Eddie Cummings is in Eddie Cummings as a champion Gio is in it and any Cummings came back from a bunch of surgeries right didn't he have some shit go wrong punch injuries he's been hurt a couple times it's normal though yeah especially his style right and you got to think he's to constantly train with all those Danaher death squad leglock masters or going after each other every day yeah testing their meniscus yeah yikes yeah leg locks get shit out of people hell yeah oh yeah but back to that 1/2 L dos Anjos fight I just can't believe how good that dude looks at 170 pounds he looks like like top ten pound for pound in the world for sure like he did the combinations he was laying on Robbie Lawler fuck man he looks so goddamn good yeah it's crazy yeah and you think this guy was making 150 making 154 you know he still still looks like a small welterweight though he could add some more muscle I think uh some of those guys at 170 were monsters like Darren till oh yeah but he kicked so hard I think the kicks are gonna always he's always gonna be in the game even even if he's smaller his kicks are so hard he's fast as shit to men and combinations are beautiful and he's just super dedicated Mike - Aldo Santos is very very disciplined very driven you ever see some of his plyometric workouts that he does no he was with Nick curse on from speed of sport I know he's done some work with other people too but he did a lot of it wouldn't it curse on and Nickerson's from that the Marinovich camp you know where the like with member when BJ Penn was trained by the Marinovich s so he's doing like this kind of shit like pushing up on all these bars a lot of foot strength drills a lot of stuff where they're doing jumps over hurdles and you know those horses what are those called hurdles right yeah he just does a lot of planning that is hardcore yeah that's working your abs you're working your feet he's lying on his back and he's kicking up on these things it would give you like the ultimate up kick - but the idea is just that you're put in these compromising positions off balance all the time and you're doing a lot of different plyometric drills he doesn't believe too much in like regular weightlifting type activity everything is like sport specific plyometric type shit but what what I'm always super impressed with is his endurance dude he fought it a easy pace and like the commentated Cormier in John annek we're going man I wonder if he's gonna burn himself out you know I already knew the result before I watched it I got to watch it after the fact I didn't watch it live but watching it I was like man I see why they would think that he might have burnt himself out because it's crazy the volume just dig and it is so skillful to men it was like he was picking his shots you know he'd go head head body body head head body head body head it was all like creative and constantly attacking it Robbie law was just rolling with it it's like defensively and offensively it's a very impressive scene because Robbie law is hurt he can't move his leg good his legs been chopped up so he's kind of stationary and dos Anjos is just moving in for the kill and throwing bombs on him and Robbie Lawler is just rolling with everything he's taken a lot of them in the body but he's rolling with everything it's hard to hit him clean and he's right in front of in the middle of the fight in the middle of this exchange Robbie Lawler smiling yeah crazy right yeah can't walk like barely can movies get his leg kicked out from under him he's fighting a guy who's just like a Wolverine let me just on I'm attacking and Robbie Lawler smiling but he did pull that pull it out of his ass against Melvin man who funny I did whoo can we see that yeah I was getting it was um alley taxi or was this strikeforce strikeforce strikeforce he was getting beat down by Melvin man whoo yeah and then one shot boom mm-hmm yeah he always had that chance Yeah right to the very end he had that chance yep yeah the Melvin Manhoef one-two was at 185 that was a bigger Robbie remembering he fought Tim Kennedy at 185 he fought a couple good guys at 185 he fought Jake Shields remember Jake Shields tapped him at 180 500 boom go back a little so we could see the beginning he's getting his leg kick good all of it look how much bigger he looks back then and Melvin moves in for the kill and Robbie hits him with a fucking I mean boom and then follows up with a left hand that's stiffened him I mean that's like one of the all-time strikeforce chaos one of the all-time MMA chaos because he's getting his ass kicked he's moving away and then he steps in and here goes getting his legs kicked out from under him here it is BAM crazy and you see Melvin's body just shut off is he still fighting yeah see now no he's had a lot of chaos man he's fighting I think he's fighting for Bellator right now he's been he's been Kayla like quite a few times recently it's one of those guys that never got into the UFC no almost man I mean maybe he could put some wins together and get back in the UFC and get in the UFC for the first time but he's you know I gotta he's like 37 now how old is Melvin Manhoef it's gonna be I don't know man I got I think he's got to be 36 37 41 yeah what's his biggest MMA mark hunt one punch damn he kayoed mark hunt with one punch mark hunt charged out a mark hunt was like 260 net and I don't think anybody ever stop mark like that before and Melvin clipped him with an uppercut coming in he's like 190 baby yeah maybe maybe 200 so he was at the very least he was like 60 pounds lighter at the very least fuck knocked him out with one punch remember when he fought Sakuraba soccer kick soccer Abba it was one of the Sakuraba 's most terrifying losses it was terrifying Melvin fucked him up dude I don't know what happened but I don't remember it pull that pull up Melvin Manhoef versus Sakuraba this was hard for me to watch because it was Sakuraba who had fought Wanderlei twice he'd been Kayode by Wanderlei he fought a lot of guys and he had gotten beat up quite a bit you were seeing like the demise of in my opinion like one of those charismatic guys from that generation I didn't know a word that guy said never never heard him speak English in like any long sentences but I knew he had charisma just by the way fought the way handle himself when he wore diapers yes he's crazy oh my God look big Melvin is he's on all the steroids hisses they did not give a fuck back then man they let these guys look how Jack Diaz holy shit Melvin Manhoef had one of the scariest bodies of all time for sure right look at him I mean dude he's jacked and he was so fucking fast you know it's just like any old warrior he's just had a lot of fights and you know this is where he's at now but God I his hands are Robin never held his hands high like that before very dangerous and look Melvin just waiting he'd always have his hands low remember that you know not against Melbourne man especially not at this point in his career and her about soccer Rahab his fucking knees man that wasn't just for show his knees were basically like falling apart on them so he had a like wrapped him up in the most insane mummy like way laid on in his career well people forget sakuraba beat Vitor Sakuraba broke Enzo's arm remember that yeah dude i commentated that fight that's right you work for pride back then yeah look at the size of Melvin he just looks like a coil head kick right hand boom oh my god boom past the guard boom boom boom boom boom this is this is one of the hardest ones to watch here's the knee knee to the head now just gonna move him to the side and try over the soccer oh right here I did not stop this fight right how they not stop this fight boom because it was soccer Robin you wanted to give him a chance that leg to the right hand is so I thought it was I thought he soccer kicked him in the head on the ground I had erroneous memories I could've swore he saw I kicked him in the head but really he was kneeing him in the head somebody soccer kicked him in the head he had another I think that's Wanderlei I think you might be right vandal he definitely did it to Tamura right remember he held the rope and stomped him remember that one he kale he dropped him tomorrow went down he grabs the Roca stomps his head it's rough shear off to watch I remember Wanderlei was mounting Dan Henderson and then just stood up and try to stomp on his face oh that's right away yeah yeah I don't mean landed though see if you fight Wanderlei caio's Tamura did you get it oh this is yeah no that's just Sakuraba trying to do that that was to Vitor right yeah that was that Vitor is a Vitor that was in rough shape though he that was after his his sister had gotten kidnapped and murdered I believe remember Vitor was like a shell of himself for a long time after that remember I think he was in the UFC at that point when his I don't think so you might be right though when he fought Sakuraba in Japan is that way down about when he ever hate throughout training sidekick and dropped him mm-hmm yeah I'm sorry with the body yeah right to the body that dropped Vitor he just basically but scoot most of the match what's interesting too about Sakuraba is he he had a catch wrestling base you know like he he had some real submission skills and people didn't know in the beginning never his first fight in the UFC he gets dropped by coin so Viera refereed Big John McCarthy stops the fight and then realizes it was an error because he had dropped down for a knee so they fight again yeah remember that what the fuck first time we have to was in Japan dude they it was like this is Sakuraba you need to fight again and then he catches him in that armbar he tapped him with an armbar never he was like white a Bruce Wayne jiu-jitsu blackbelt got tapped we didn't even think it was possible yeah we didn't think anybody some guy who doesn't even have a black belt is gonna happen yeah when Mario Sperry got tapped by Eagers and oviya romance vana what too fucking how can this be had that was devastating for me yeah he reversed the Kimura on him and took the arm yeah man you got it right there man crazy look how Jack Sakuraba was back then he was in great shape he's such a fucking awesome grappler and so important to like the history of MMA a guy was in some wild fights and some of them with people you had no business being in there with just the wrong people like like Wanderlei like that was just terrible man rare that is like there's a lot of bad calls and a lot of Fighters that get fucked from bad ref calls that you can't ever do the fight over you can't do the fight that was one of the only times it happened another time - yeah it happened when i commentated for too hot to handle and amsterdam i don't know if you remember i do remember in 2001 it was a gilbert ival against fuck i don't know who i don't remember who it was but gilbert I will knocks this guy out or standing TKO they stopped the fight and then the guys complaining to the ref like why did you stop it it's like why did you stop and I was fine but clearly he wasn't fine but you gotta at least you know plead your case right and make it look like you're fine like I wanted to stop and do something the ref just said you know what you ready to go get back we're good you put gilbert in one corner the other dude and then once that guy he's seen in his face once he realizes that the ref restarted the fight he said he sinks back into the what do you put on here Jame it was a can athon Frye which one Oh Gilbert I've oh yeah well maybe this is another no wait a minute which fight are you talking about no the restart no no no no no no this was that - this was but Gilbert ival too hot to handle what happened to Don Frye did get poked in the eye or something you have a cut like why were they checking on them I don't remember what happened earlier in that fight I don't even remember what happened in that fight versus Don Frye that's that sounds awesome Big Daddy Goodrich kayo Don friar the head kick big Gilbert I've old Kayode Big Daddy Goodrich yeah I always daddy Goodrich Kayode Don Frye with a head kick this is this is Don Frye and Gilbert ival see if you find Don Frye or Big Daddy Goodrich Kos Don Frye on that hill or the beautiful head kick on that card that commentators pride ten in soccer Robin hen so that was the main event but also was Gilbert evil versus Gary Goodridge and that was that one yeah if you could find out Gary Goodridge against Gilbert ival that's a it's a 10-second match yeah and that's one kick boom Eclipse um shuts him off here's the Gary Goodridge Don Frye one leg kicks Big Daddy had one of the most brutal Kos ever in the history of the UFC - and then remember that uh from the fireman's carry oh shit against Paul Herrera yep that was the most brutal knockout probably in history it's one of them I mean come on there's a beautiful head kick over the shoulder he got one back yeah that one that one that happened against him he was out for like five minutes it was one of those and then he told me that when he woke up he was standing in the ring he thought he was in a rave in Toronto he was what if we were all living all the time one move left or right one dream one action propels you into the next door what if he was like on death's door and they decide look he's gone from this dimension we're gonna put him in a nightclub in Toronto and let his consciousness ride out this experience here and he was he's back his sister was always with him she was like she was a fitness chick she's jacked crazy braids and he said when he woke up he thought he was at a rave and he he thought his sister was some chick he was macking on no idea was a sister that's so crazy yeah it's um that guy's taken a long career man taking a lot of crazy fights so do you think dos Anjos gonna get a shot at Woodley now you would know better than I would I don't though I would think you would you didn't get inside to us anymore I do I have to ask though I feel like I shouldn't ask one time sometimes I get in some inside info but for the the inside info I get I can never talk about anyway but this one's a weird one man because he was lightweight champion you know loses the belt and then has looked insane as a welterweight and just beats the former champion like out classism I think he stands out as the number one guy in terms of like guys getting another shot at the title but Woodley apparently is gonna get some sort of surgery now mm-hmm he needs shoulder surgery he's got like a torn labrum so if tyron woodley goes out and then they have to put an interim title fight in i would like to see him first is somebody in an interim title fight like how about half all dos Anjos vs. Colby covington hmm all the anti brazilian hate all the shit that he said i'd be nice be crazy that would be crazy and it would be a big fight you know because of all the shit colby talked you know the only fine for doom like 500 bucks were hitting them in the head with a boomerang 600 600 Fabricio is probably like that is so worth it you get to hit somebody in the head with a boomerang on TV you know yeah you know the opposite of a fight like that which would be have a lot of hatred is uh in Orlando the UFC in Orlando um it's gonna be Ben Saunders versus Allen Joe bond well that's hard yeah that's all I'm staying away from that one that's gonna be a hard one for me too yeah I told them both not to take it but the problem is they're on losing streaks and they can't be choosen they did reach out and say hey man we're both temp planet you know can find other opponents and they said no so they both need to do it and I'm staying out of that one yeah yeah you can't corner anybody right yeah two friends fighting are you gonna go to watch no watch on TV you know I'm gonna stay completely out of it I was just gonna tell you like I like being there live but I have the most fun when it's us when we do fight companions yeah we're all here drinking we crazy shit I've been to enough ufc's man I'm gonna have you know a lot that's for sure I'd rather watch it on my phone yeah I know what you mean well I don't like watching on my phone but I do like watch it at home I like watching boxing at home too man you know it's like you get all the angles you get to hear the commentary Roy Jones jr. had some fucking amazing commentary this weekend on boxing it's so interesting here and it's hearing a guy like Roy Jones who like points shit out he was uh I forget the two dudes that were fighting there's a guy there were two two guys that I never heard of I think one of them was Williams the other one was all Sullivan or something like that and I didn't know who they were and I was waiting for the main event and I was watching this dude and Roy Jones was pointing out all the shit that he was doing with his jab is like he's staying right there after he throws a jab he's gonna get hit with counters and then you see boom the counter start dropping on him and the guy was getting hit was the guy was favored he was like it was a really hot prospect and Roy just starts pointing out all the shit he's doing he's like he's playing tough guy now he goes I want to see a play tough guy it was I want to see a boxing he goes you don't want to find who the toughest guy is he was you want to find out who the best boxer is these guys are just trying to break each other now he totally called it and you see the guy starting to wilt shots to the body it was really interesting to watch like a world champion top of the food chain where the greatest of all time boxers sees him shit that you're not gonna see you know like he sees vulnerabilities that you don't see are there any high level boxers that are openly talking about transitioning to MMA you know not that I know of I think Jacobs has joked about it you know the heavyweight champion and our Joshua Anthony Joshua I want to call him Anthony Jacobs Anthony Joshua was his name right Jesus Christ you know Klitschko used to be a kickboxer you know that there's a brother especially I think his brother was like a world champion PKA karate style kickboxer but no none that I know of man Floyd talked about it apparently date this is one thing I can tell you Dana told me that Floyd wants to make a deal in the UFC like legitimately and I go did he I guess I texted him I go this Floyd really talking about fighting MMA he goes yeah he's fucking crazy I told him he'd get killed but he's still talking about doing it hmm for us a hobby teases GSP vs. Mayweather or McGregor as next fight we need a mega fight okay let me just stop this nonsense right there GSP just fought at 185 pounds if you fucking really think that Floyd Mayweather is gonna fight GSP shut the fuck up just stop just stop it me where there's gonna be like a pass that guy's huge GSP so big it have to be like like Joe's a diverse you'd have to get GSP to dye it down to 155 and he would be so depleted and making 155 Floyd would light him up like a Christmas tree if Floyd didn't light him up like a Christmas tree anyway I mean they're gonna fight in MMA he gets smushed 100% there's no never fight 185 GSP no no but they might fight it 170 if the money was right if McGregor won't take it I don't know about that man that could be a mega mega fight that could be a 20 million dollar fight Conor might want an extra 20 spent a lot of money on Versace he's always wearing furs and shit fly it around in private jets that shit's pricey man what is the latest with McGregor like what's going on like today hashtag ballin that's what's going on he's on top of the world man look that guy let him enjoy this he's got plenty of time to come back to fighting just have fun man stare at your watches take Instagram pictures of you dick who Aires you're the fucking man he made a hundred million dollars you're not even 30 relax do whatever the fuck you want no need to force him to come back and fight but if he does come back and fight if he if he thinks an MMA fight with GSP is a good idea like that's a big guy he's very big George st. Pierre is one of the best fighters of all time and take that fight he's so fucking good at grappling but fucking now fuck it give me a couple months put some weight on that's not a good fight for him but if that's where all the money is who knows I think Tony Ferguson is the fight that's the fight I want to see now worse until I see what happens with Barbosa and nurmagomedov right the problem is if Barboza and nurmagomedov fight and nurger madoff smashes Barbosa he's got to be next in line for the title fight right no you don't think so cuz I was not fighting Tony is that oh oh but counters not fighting yeah please well then yes vacate right what is this I hear sorted rounds tonight an SG b BG Ireland he's trained I mean he's definitely not fat you look at him there he's in shape for sure I mean but he might just be working on his skills he's got a hundred million dollars I would not be mad at a world fight if they decided to like strip him of his belt and have Tony versus kabhi for the undisputed title I wouldn't be mad at that yeah that will probably happen I would not be mad at that I like that fight Tony so fun he's so wild to watch man you know like when he was fighting Kevin lean he's walking towards him with his hands down and just pot shot him and slowly wearing I'm slowly chipping him away and then the finish him off is back come on man sweep how many people get finished off their back there was a lot of sweet things that he came up with right there like work you know there's different ways you can get up off your back with the cage there's like basic wall walking and stuff like that but you can't wall walk on everybody right you it all depends on where your level of wall walking is and how good is your opponent at countering that what did you think when Kevin Lee walked in with the heaviest staph infection on his chest did you notice it I was like cool I hope he's weak Tony did you notice his staff goes yeah I was trying to punch it but what what tone the way Tony got up off the cage when when Kevin Lee put him up against the cage he actually can opener him from the bottom and fool guard so Tony was head was against the cage mm-hmm and Kevin Lee's head was right here so he basically did like a Muay Thai clinch like can't opener right bottom so he couldn't get hit and then he had he had on his left foot on the hip and his right leg was just around his ribs and then at the right time Kevin was naturally trying to push pull out cuz he was holding him in he couldn't hit him he was safe against the cage and then Tony put both feet on the hips pushed him up kicked up and then just stood up it was bra like wow we're gonna be doing that one yeah I'm gonna be what I mean he Kevin Lee couldn't do anything at him exactly where he wanted him against the cage on his back head pressed against the fence but he couldn't do anything cuz Tony did a can opener on no one no one does that I know he's an interesting guy man that was the first time we ever did that and it worked crazy yeah it was perfect what did you think what do you think about Francis and Cano and Alistair over him how ridiculous was that yeah how fuckin scary doctor how many times is outstripping ko'd we did it on a podcast I broke it down it was like something like 13 Kos and MMA and then another three in kickboxing who the ones in kickboxing seems so much more brutal I don't know not more brutal than that last one that last one is as brutal as anything I've ever seen he got launched into another dimension I'm not I'm not a giant kickboxing fan I mean really I never watched kickboxing but if it's on I watch it's you know glory in LA though that was the shit yeah yeah but I'm not saying I'm not following it right I mean I don't know who hell is winning no idea zero idea but when I do watch it when every now and then I'll watch a k1 you do notice that they hit a lot motherfucking harder you'd the leg kicks in do my fuck this is some other kind of shit I'm not you you could visibly see it after watching so much MMA and then go watch them kick box and you'll see how hard they fucking kid yeah as some serious kicking going on well you see it now with like gokhan Saki now the coke on sakis in the UFC you know I like I was watching from Turkey Turkish Tyson he's ridiculous I mean he's a brutal knockout artist in k1 and yeah in glory to see that dude fighting the UFC you see these crazy kicks you see do you see kick boxers transitioning to MMA yeah but you don't know you don't see professional boxers transition that's too hard without the leg kicks your your whole striking thing is so different you got to think about those goddamn leg kicks I mean some guys are gonna be able to make it it's not impossible all they have to do is be super dedicated but they have to have a motivation and right now the motivation in boxing is you know if you get to a high level you could be a world champion you make a shitload of money and there's a lot of money at the highest levels of boxing but even at the highest levels of boxing like you have to have some name value like they did a Gennady golovkin pay-per-view and it got like a hundred and fifty thousand bars and didn't they say that Ward kovalev was like really low as well one of the best fights ever Ward kovalev to Andre Ward stopped Andre kovalev fucking amazing fight Sergey Kovalev brother and I think it only got like a hundred and sixty something 125 thousand pay-per-view buys that's crazy so those guys aren't making shitloads of money for that did you have no whether it's crazy yeah it's incredible yeah but to do your sport like this is what if you're a really good boxer you you probably have more of a chance of making it as a you know a top-flight boxer than you do of learning all that other shit while you're already 29 you're gonna learn how to check leg kicks now okay you got to change your stance do you know how to take people down you don't you got to learn that you get learn how to get taken down okay you got to learn how to stand back up got a little head defend submissions you gotta learn to execute submissions by the time that I mean they're basically that could take seven years you can take forever whereas a kickboxer it's a little different if you get Mirko Cro Cop when you fought Wanderlei Silva he was fighting like one of the top guys like almost right away because he was so scary on the feet and they made some crazy rules remember those crazy rules like you only be on the ground for 30 seconds I told remember those rules they had a crazy rule with Vandelay versus cro cop the first one first vandala vs cro cop remember the much a wacky rules man like you you go to the ground you can only go to the ground for like 30 seconds and if the fight if no-one wanted the end of the fight was a draw so it was real weird man it's like crow cop didn't know really how to stop takedowns as well back then and you know he's just trying to get off his kicks and he got off a bunch of kicks but then they fought again and they fought again later when crow cop had figured out the takedown defense game and it was one of the worst chaos of vanderley's career cro cop fucking clanged him upside the head with that left shin remember that one heel bit of a giant gash on Van Billy's head so van de Leite goes down like literally he was an axe murderer that was his nickname the axe murderer it literally went down like he got hit in the head with an axe blood pouring down his head and was that was one of the all-time great Mirko Cro Cop headkick knockouts was it Mirko Cro Cop I'm pretty sure it was who fought that guy in Japan who wore a mask mask at Dos Caras yes clipped him on the head and you see the blood pouring out of his eye dude dude i opening wasn't that when he was fighting with shoes on - he fought a bunch of those with wrestling shoes on they led Mirko headkick people with bread wrestling shoes on yeah I know we fought mark hung with wrestling shoes on he had kicked mark hunt with wrestling shoes about pete williams had kicked - Mark Coleman with wrestling yes he did yes he did yeah that's crazy a lot of people more wrestling shoes back then it's an interesting argument like what's worse to get in your eye a toe in your eye our fucking wrestling shoes wrestling shoes are so much better for traction now look at him there with fucking tape on his shit nobody took a punch or kick ever as good as Mark Hunt which is why it's even crazier that Melvin knocked him out look at that boom right over the top and Mark Hunt still in it throwing bombs what a savage so what in Ghana now is gonna fights deep hey what do you think of that that's a tough one to call that's an interesting fight though isn't it steep it was on your podcast What did he say well he's pretty confident that's what he says but I would say that too but uh that dude in Ghana is like a character from a fucking Conan book you know like somebody brought this up online that like how Conan when he was young they made him push that wheel and that's how it got so strong Francis and Ghana was like working in like a sand mine he was digging sand when he was like a young guy like that literally might have had an effect on how fucking powerful and strong he is it really might be like an epic fantasy novel like he's he's like if you were gonna go into a lab and design a perfect heavyweight you'd say one I'm about 64 to 65 maybe a little heavier has to cut a little bit maybe to 69 cuts down to 65 crazy freak athleticism fastest shit for a heavyweight knock anybody dead with one punch I feel like you're asking for too much yeah heavyweights don't move that fast they get tired real quick not everyone can knock you out with one punch from France he was originally from Cameroon I think so right yeah and then France after that did he was look at this it was grueling and dangerous work spending hours shoveling sand into the backs of trucks so it could be shipped to big cities for using construction sometimes we'd stand all day and water up to Shin's scooping sand out of the riverbed other days we spent at the bottom of a steep quarry where large chunks of Earth often broke free from the high cliffs and tumbled down on to workers fuck man that's a movie that's like that's like the beginning of a movie right there you want to talk about that Drake song started from the bottom yeah I mean he really started from the bottom yeah I mean he was there he was homeless in France just like six years ago five years ago do you know that no dude he was homeless in what for a story like how did he get into MMA he was in he was in Africa and he had decided that he was going to take a trip to Europe and he wanted to get away from where he was and he decides to go there it doesn't exactly know what he's doing and somehow or another he makes his way into a gym because he wanted to learn how to box and he made his way into an MMA gym and the coach was like look you should you should try him in May like you know like you could really get good at this and he realizes the guy's a sponge learned shit ridiculously quick you look at him in his first UFC fight versus now with Curtis blades watch the Curtis blades fight and then watch him now that's only two years ago man it's only two years ago and but his improvement is insane he just knocked out with one punch one of the greatest heavyweight kick boxers ever hey Alistair Overeem was a k1 Grom Prix Champion Strikeforce Heavyweight Champion dream heavyweight champion they don't get any more experience than Alistair Overeem fought for the title right one punch first round boom it is a little late in his career though it is a good point this is has anybody gone the distance with them RZ knocking everybody know he's he he lost one fight I think he got lost a decision I think like an early fight in his career and then I think Anthony Hamilton he submitted him with a Kimura he submitted someone with a Kimura I think it was Hamilton is that correct let's see Anthony Hamilton yeah he submitted Anthony Hamilton was with Kimura Kayode Arlovski ko'd Overeem k out the KO dove boullion me mia Kovac was a crazy one man he was just dropping bombs on him Curtis blades was before that he TKO'd him doctor stoppage Lewis and reek was before that that was the first time I ever saw him on I was like geez but uh it looks like decision unanimous against a dude named zhu mana c SE c-- is sec zoo mana cease what a great name dude he's got its first fight he won by armbar yeah straight armbar he's got an arm kragle choke he's got a standing guillotine choke submission and he's got one submission in the UFC by Kimura he's working with Vinny Magalhaes you know I didn't know that yeah Vinny Magalhaes says he's so fucking strong says the strongest guys ever rolled with I did not know that yeah he's in Vegas now yep he's at the UFC Training Institute they got him over there like rocky for it's crazy damn like he's driving formants institute yeah he's at he's like literally I mean think about this right you got a guy who's arguably one of the best physical specimens we've ever seen in the heavyweight division like right like it's you can't think of someone who's more impressive than him physically right then you have a guy who just gives up his whole life for this like he just moved from France to Vegas then the UFC puts him in this fucking state-of-the-art laboratory this performance Institute where they've got all kinds of crazy shit in there I mean they have therapists and food they have all these strength and conditioning coaches I mean there these guys are starting to do their camps down there they're going there and they're like holy shit like this place is insane no no Vince key was telling me all the different services they offer and all the different things they do for the athletes for them it's fucking amazing all these top-flight coaches are their training with them so you got this amazing facility opens right he's like one of the first guys there he's like one of the first guys to do his camps their moves from France to Vegas brings his coach and he's just ready to smash the world dude it's like a movie yeah homeless homeless guy walks into a gym six years later UFC hopefully he doesn't talk about the food chain for the title hopefully it doesn't start doing ecstasy and I'm gonna raves I know right you got to keep them from getting too crazy I mean because um well first of all you gotta get past eBay and Steve pays gonna be the first real wrestler that he's ever faced that's a big deal you know it's whether or not steep a can take him to the ground it's a big question Curtis blades actually very good wrestler too steep guys gonna try to take him down anything I would imagine there's gonna be a lot of everything I was gonna I'm gonna imagine that fight you're not gonna be able to really dictate entirely where everything takes place I don't know too much about steep hill on the ground he's not usually on the ground right he's usually on the ground but he's a very good wrestler that's done college yeah yeah I think I think he's 20-plus pounds lighter though like he's about 240 have submission wins and on his record it's a good question I've never seen him win by submission and I've only seen a win by knockout or decision Steven go to steep A's record yeah I mean he's got to know everything it's the question is does he know is he strong enough is his wrestling good enough to close the distance what does he got any submissions T ko ko ko TKO - it's mostly TKO details dude he's fucked a lot of people up one submission by leg kicks though that's he got tapped out from leg kicks Stefan Struve beat him kom kom Wow yeah TKO time somewhere in Europe I think it was Nottingham Nottingham England hey hey yeah man beat mark hunt by TKO Orlovsky by TKO for BC over doom by KO Overeem ko Junior dos Santos TKO that's a fucking hell of a win streak right there man he's no joke man the Fabio Maldonado one was scary remember that fight Fabio took that he was supposed to be fighting someone else and Fabio took that fight in Brazil as a heavyweight and how did it go down I love smash them steep it was just way too big just way too big just smashed them knocked him out same way knocked there it is boom that's him it's true there hears from him in Maldonado yeah let that go this was you mean Stevie right now is in his prime for sure but this was a good example that oh it's just a lot of his fights he's a tough guy man he takes a good shot and he's a good wrestler he's strong he likes to ground-and-pound yeah he's just gonna have to figure out a way to deal with the extreme physical advantages that Francis and goneö has when is that if I go down that is Boston January 20th oh shit oh shit don't come that's also volcon OHS Damir and Daniel Cormier are on that car too that's interesting hosed Amir's ko2 really good guys in around misha sakura off in one round and then he just killed Jimmy Manawa in one round that was a he hits fucking hard Russian I don't think so it says Switzerland yeah Volken sounds like like a Vulcan but that's an interesting fight too is that's a good fucking card man steep a and Francis and Ghana's so scary what's the latest a John Jones I don't know man I don't think they've reached any sort of conclusion I don't know if they have some sort of an excuse I don't know when the trial is I think it's it's got to be sometime coming up soon but it hasn't been in the news see if you can find out when the trial is it's gonna be interesting see what what they say or what they think he could be mm-hmm did I tell you the craziest rumor about it talked about it on the podcast for the craziest rumor was everybody knows John likes to party I'm not throwing him under the bus I mean he's even joked around he said to DC when DC was talking shit he's like I beat you after I did cocaine yeah I mean it's just fucking hilarious but the craziest rumor was that they cut creatine with cocaine it's one of the things they cut cocaine with and that they used some cheap Chinese creatine that was steroid tainted which is apparently very common apparently there's a lot of creatine's and different things you take they have trace amounts of steroids that'll show up in a test because the same vats they make that shit in they make steroids in and they make everything again they're making them in China these really shitty bulk plays and you'll occasionally get tainted supplements happens all the time maybe they were purposely tainted that could happen to we talking about that the greatest creatine ever yeah this should jokes me out yeah right yeah probably maybe that's just that that's just the way to sell steroid you just sell creatine but what's interesting it says California State Athletic Commission right because it was in California so who gets to decide California gets to decide is that how it works because the California State Athletic Commission so they apparently get to decide what happens in his future oh you sada you sada if found guilty this time he faces up to a four-year ban holy shit what's the minimum though I don't know I mean it really depends on whether or not he's got an actual excuse if he could get that fucking dealer to get him some coke and it's got the steroids in it but you never the problem is you would only have a decent excuse you wouldn't you wouldn't have you wouldn't be exonerated there would still be some sort of a penalty wait a minute man wait am ia they're cutting in China they're cuttin creatine with coke or with steroids they're using creatine to cut cocaine so if you buy cocaine see if you got a kilo of cocaine you want stretch that shit out man kilo and a quarter oh I got the thing bro super fucking muscle dick creatine and super muscle dick creatine has some steroids in it and so when they're cutting this cocaine with this creatine that has steroids he's snorting the coke this is he not meaning John Jones a person I'm making this up right just I don't know what not sure happen no no this could be true the rumor is that this has been shown to test positive that he did coke and it had creatine in it and the creatine on steroids in it the rumor is that is what people think could be a possibility because if John likes to party and we know John likes to party it is entirely possible that he might have partied and that he might have just had a little bit of that and in that was this creatine because like if you think about their cutting with all kinds of different stuff right they cut it with me I'm not a cocaine doctor but I got to imagine they take some white shit that like coke and he can make more coke right that's what the cutting is right yeah but to cut it with creatine apparently it's kamek we looked it up we actually lose it yeah damn I thought you were saying that he was taking creatine and it had it was tainted with steroids that's my nobody this job would be better for him if that was the case that would be good because that way you could take that creatine too you sada and you'd have to have it on a list to shit your take and you say look it's just says it's creatine that's all I took and they test it they're like oh shit this does have steroids in it and then the go and find another one that's like from the same that they can find like the VAT numbers I guess they'll find one independently hopefully from a store come if they test that if they find a trace amount of steroids and that and that's what got um Dirty Bird Tim means he got off for that that's how he got off he didn't take any steroids just took some fucking over-the-counter normal supplement that wasn't supposed to have steroids in it and then he tested positive he was stunned and he looked at Timmy as loo even lifts weights he doesn't remotely look like a guy use of steroids and they tested the stuff that they found just randomly in the store and that tested positive so he only got a short amount of a suspension hmm yeah it was pretty quick like six months or something like that but even then if you didn't do anything wrong why would you get six months and so you're saying that the steroids are in creatine on accident not like they're not doing it on purpose right no well here's the thing this is your speculation all right all I'm here I'm hearing a rumor right but the speculation is that these labs where they make creatine they also make a gang of other things right they'll cook up some steroids for you whatever the fuck the order is right now they're not cleaning those vats out right so if they're just pouring another bag if they pour out the steroids and they pour about creatine in there for the next batch and they're mixing everything up it's entirely possible to trace amounts of those steroids are getting into that stuff when we first started doing alpha brain we had some of the early versions tested and when we got the stuff mixed from a place the place didn't do a very good job of cleaning out their equipment we had vitamins in our alpha brain that weren't in there we had some stuff the Sun suppose being there so when we tested and we found trace amounts we had a switch what we were doing we had changed how we how we have the things manufactured that's a super common thing when you're dealing with these overseas laboratories that are making all your shit together so that's one possibility and another possibility that I've said before though a lot of people say I'm fucking crazy somebody could have given him something somebody could have given him something to fuck with him somebody could have not liked him somebody could have done that too I'm not saying that's what happened but I'm saying you have to take any consideration all the possibilities if John is telling the truth and he's totally stunned by this there's a lot of different possibilities and one of them could easily be somebody giving it to him it also could be that he took steroids that's possible to I don't know if you owned a creatine company you'd kind of want your creatine to be to you yeah you guys you're making steroids there too right okay cool can we use the same bat I don't know what's true yeah you know they do that with those dick pills apparently those gas-station dick pills they have like generic viagra in them that's why they work so well oh no they just used to say that your honor your honor we we didn't know that they use the same fats yeah they do that and they also put steroids and those things too do you know Brian Redman was the first one to call that John Jones had take dick pills that's why he tested positive rabe and put it together in his head cuz he does coke he looked look you do Cokie dick doesn't work we do your dick doesn't work you take those gas-station dick pills he probably took one of those pills if he goes I take those pills I feel like a fucking animal he's like I feel like I've got steroids in me I'm like really he goes yeah he get real aggressive dick as hard as a fucking piece of metal like okay all right turns out he's right hmm that's crazy and it was the same thing with Anderson Silva when Anderson Silva tested positive it was from some sort of Chinese dick pill stuff and they found it and they tested it right that does cook he's done it he doesn't do it all the time but he's done it so he knows what it's like to party and that's what he was saying he's like I know what it's like if you're partying he's like your dick doesn't work he's a key party's right well he probably did cause he tested positive for coke he's like he probably does that right ban totally nailed it or maybe he was doing ecstasy people take viagra on ecstasy you know yeah could be that too you know yeah look he's a wild motherfucker and he likes to party the question is did he actually take a steroid with the intention to cheat that's what we don't know he says he didn't I wish there was a way that you a hundred blade one hundred percent could tell someone was lying a hundred percent you watched that black mayor episode where everything's being videotaped with their yes contact lenses yes so they're just like reviewing everything they've said yeah freak yeah that's coming if we don't have artificial intelligence that takes over the world before then that's coming that they're gonna be you're gonna be able to record you're gonna have some fuckin chip that you put in the back of your head that's gonna store all the stuff directly from your nervous system you're gonna be able to review it an HD mmm - at the moment they can give you eyes that work better than your eyes you have an artificial disc right think of that I saw a dude who got attacked by a shark and he had no arm and no leg but here he was with a carbon-fiber arm and a carbon-fiber leg and he's walking around if you didn't know you would never know like from the knee down he was missing his leg and from the middle of his black bicep area he had a fake arm you should do have a made it's knocked the fuck out of people if I killed people just punch holes right through their chest he could leg lock him with that bleep with the California Athletic Commission let someone fight with a cyborg arm no no check they'd have to start another lead with just yeah amputees with cyborg arms remember that dude was his name Nick Newell he used to fight me in one arm remember now he had like he was born with like a stump on one side he put a glove on the stump yeah I think that uh man there's it's entirely possible that in our lifetime they're gonna have better parts for sure for sure than what we have and once girls start preferring that like they only date dudes with like cyborg legs you know they're like that machine dudes gonna start chopping off their fucking legs the first guy that cuts his own eyes out for robot eyes that's gonna be crazy shit it's gonna happen yeah there's Nick yeah it's gonna be is gonna be no chance that anybody's gonna want to be normal like yeah just rather fade away and get fat if you get dyes cyborgs legs and you could run like 40 miles an hour yeah you could jump over buildings yeah people chop the fucking legs off for sure drink imagine you got some Ironman legs like literally you could jump over a building like first of all just stop and think about living in the Year 1500 and someone someone somehow or another takes you to a place and shows you a Hayabusa motorcycle he'd be like what the fuck is that oh this thing it's just you lie on that it goes 0 to 60 in less than two seconds he just fucking you would you would never believe that could be real you could took someone from the 1700s to 1800s even the 1900 1900 s they would kind of get it because they had bicycles but if you go back like a thousand years ago and show someone a motorcycle they'd be absolutely convinced there's no way that could exist it can't be real it doesn't make any sense I think if you go a thousand years from now it's gonna be the same shit with our bodies we're gonna have ridiculous capabilities and it'll look just like a regular body so do some sort of like bulletproof carbon-fiber skin that'll look just like regular skin you'll be able to jump over the fucking buildings 100% yes Iron Fist yeah let's cut out I'm just gonna lose my hand well you know what bro my hands been shrinking I don't know what it is I mean people are just powerful Jamie with the phone on yeah there's gonna be times where there's no need to like like oh you broke your arm here's the good news their recovery times even last if we give you a fake arm you'd be like really yeah what you want I want wait six weeks why your fucking arm here's and then your arm can what break again you fake arm well I don't know what to do get a fake arm my fake arms everyone's gonna be just a robot like Steve Austin remember that Six Million Dollar Man yep Bionic legs remember the big foot episode the best episode ever TV shows back then was oh my god just think about all the TV shows from the seventies Oh regardless compare that to like a Netflix show comparing like Game of Thrones yeah or black Mary they did have what one shitty episode they were just knock it was just like they were hit pitching a shutout I've only seen three episodes the one where because it's all based on what life is gonna be like in ten years right like a little bit in the future you know yeah and that one episode where everyone's just rating each other all the time you know I'm talking about they're just it's happening now though it's called nosedive yeah I get it I get into happening but that was that episode is kind of like that's I mean compared to the other episodes I should see the one with the video game where the guy they put a little thing in the back of his head yes and he doesn't know when the game's on and when it's off yeah that how about the one where the the dude the dude catches his his wife he figures out that she's cheating on him yeah oh he's acting whoever that actors yeah his acting that was that was a an amazing episode man yeah they're intense man there's and the writing was so good like to do with the husband hold on social credit app seen in black mirrors becoming reality in China whoa yeah it makes sense makes sense you're gonna have augmented reality and people gonna have like your Facebook score hovering over your head like this is Mike he's a super swell guy he's got four and a half stars from everyone he meets yeah yeah it's kind of like that with followers you know yeah yeah yeah man it's gonna be a weird world when our kids are our age it's gonna be a weird weird world yes I mean I don't even think we could begin to comprehend it I think we'd be totally guessing I think there's some shit that's coming around the corner do you see that NASA Tom DeLonge thing everybody keeps harassing me about the the video the UFO I'm here I'm reading up more videos all day long like not just one mmm let's see let me see one of them videos is Tom DeLonge putting out videos no his his organization is putting out videos of UFOs yeah in some a fighter pilot and fa-18 I believe is chasing this thing and it's showing all the details of like the Lao the altitude how fast it's going what pitch it's at and all that jazz I know what that means what pitches huh but they're watching this thing they try to figure out what it is one of the guys is like it's a drone it's got to be some kind of a drone they see something it turns it was going very fast so basically it's like all the other UFO but it's blurry yeah it's blurry it's in like gunsights or like you know some sort of infrared sight rather so you're looking at it through this weird infrared video where it doesn't necessarily look you know it's weird it's weird you're looking at it like okay what am I looking at I'm looking at a little object you remember that quote it could be a total bullshit quote from Wernher von Braun that he said right before he died that beware of the fake alien invasion did he say that and so many words I hope he did I hope he didn't he did it just to fuck with people it's amazing flying around he's a whole fleet of them look at my essay [Applause] so they're following it for a while and then it changes direction so whatever that is whatever that is is fucking super interesting and I heard they're now going to fly Travis Barker to Washington DC to talk to people and give him some information as well know that yeah you know next they're gonna fly Kanye West he they're gonna fly him out and show him the secret lab for real no flying Tom DeLonge I know it might not be fake it might be real it could be look here's the thing about aliens right how often do you think they'd have to visit I think they could get it done once in the 70s and be done with us they check us out and they go look at these crazy assholes this is what we're gonna do we're gonna fucking we're gonna install some cameras on the moon these stupid fuckers they won't even be able to see it we'll just put some big-ass cameras to film them from the distance and let's get out of here these people are crazy like this they're gonna have nuclear power with these assholes and they just we would never see them again so like if that really is a UFO if it really is from another planet rather how many times they have to come here you don't I mean if they are real how much evidence would you really see of them would you see it once every 10 years how are they come about that joke that was it you maybe someone had a joke that like maybe this is like the Tijuana yeah about its base will it come down here when they're fucked up and they want to see a show with that party yeah oh yeah that's super old that's 2000 early two-thousands yeah I think it's I'm not a non-believer that's for fuck sure I think it's entirely possible like if if I looked up in the sky and an alien ship flew by I would never think there's no way that can't be real it can't be possible I would think wow they fucking they visited us I mean I'm sure there's something out there that's smart I'm sure there is it's a matter what it would look like you know would it even be in a physical form anymore I mean why do we assume that everything has to be in a physical form what are you looking at Kendrick Lamar says he saw a UFO but nobody believes them on stage here is a photo it's a huge thing and yes any air monitors are Boston but they're also the best headphones you can get those dude that is like some fucking Borg shit that it's like he's already been co-opted by technology like Burt has them just for like regular listening like seven different speakers in there really badass yeah would send me a link son no that's another good a good case for a fucking phone with a headphone jack huh like that's really annoying to me that they've decided to eliminate the headphone jacks from phone just lost my second pair of ear pods you did yeah fell out of my pocket so what are you having about the headphone jacks man's cell phones now they don't have a headphone jack anymore they have this little lightning thing on the iPhones and the only ones that have headphone jacks are you can get them off of Samsung has on the new Google phones they don't have them anymore either so it's all wireless now a lot of wireless yeah or you have a dongle they have to connect at the bottom and then it connects to an audio thing at the bottom of that so basically their adapter still yeah yeah there's adapter still but you don't want to carry a fucking adapter around you know but if you want to listen to really good music I find that it's just sounds better when you have a good headphone just sounds better just doesn't sound as good I mean those air pods are great they're fine they're good enough but if you you want to like really hear the music like the the best quality can be they say the LG phone is the best for that the LGV 30 it actually has something called a quad ACK like a little amplifier built into the where the jack is for the audio so they actually have amplified sound they said it's supposed to be by far the best sound for a cellphone like they just decided to like push that like its own speaker like you don't need headphones no it's not that you don't need to speaker you definitely need a speaker but the headphone jack is like super powered it's got some some home processor in there see the thing I'm looking it up and just hearing you describe it I'm wondering like why what what they could have that's so cool and then like the article I found on the verge says it's the best audio and iPhone ever and then quote like it doesn't it just doesn't matter like they have some crazy thing and it might be awesome but it all just doesn't matter doesn't matter yeah yeah but if it's awesome if you like sound like you like your musician you like sound wouldn't I dislike go in my car I have my little Ox cable I even when you have an aux cable see the thing is if you do an aux cable through the headphone jack with the quad ack thing it make this sound better in your guitar remember bass boost on CD players back in the day yeah like everyone had that that was the coolest thing now it's gone but it's just built into all the headphones right like beats it's kind of built into it well do you remember when people's car stereos like the car stereo you would get they're always the shittiest fucking sounding things ever and then you have to buy a stereo afterwards if you wanted something good and it equalizers to them yeah yeah and then the car dealerships like what are we doing why we letting these people make money off our fucking cars because it's like they had there was a whole industry that was spawned sound like why don't we just put our own glib radios in the fucking we doing so now like if you buy like like a new car like a safe about Cadillac Escalade or something about the sound is insane yeah I'm getting those things like God it sounds perfect it's incredible just rings through the cabin you know I don't know how we got onto that Oh Holly Holm cyborg we think of that shit that's gonna be insane that's really interesting right Holly's probably the only one that has a shot against her but people forget that cyborgs are really good strikers like people think Oh Holly is gonna help class her with her boxing skills and her footwork and all that but cyborgs striking is she she's like a professional moving Thai fighter she is you know here's another thing to think about cyborgs jujitsu cyborg is a way better grappler she people forget how good her grappling is because of the fact that she wins so many fights by KO but she's competed in grappling I know she was a brown belt just a few years ago I don't know if she's advanced past that now but she's the JIT on the ground and if you look at what Hollies weakness in the Miesha Tate fight I'm sure she's gotten better since the Miesha Tate fight but Misha controlled her on the ground in one round I think it was around 2 took her down controlled her and then took her down with just a little bit left in the round in the fifth round I choked or unconscious so the ground game although I'm sure she got better at it she even she's got such a good personality and she said she's such a good sport after that she showed a picture of her with a white belt on training she's like trying to get better like like put a picture on Instagram after she got choked down and lost her title yeah that's she's got some serious character some some strikers they just don't like training jiu-jitsu they're just not into it yeah I don't know if she's into it or not into it or you know for a while there people were saying that she just wasn't that into and there's like a rampage was never into training jiu-jitsu yeah you know there's just some guys that are so confident on their feet they think that why will whatever want to learn this on the stuff on the ground let's just keep it up on our feet she's hard to take down she works on that for sure Holly's hard to take down and she likes to stand and I don't think that fights gonna end up on the ground I think I don't think cyborgs and I try to take Holly down I think cyborgs can go right at her so that's the same card as nurmagomedov in barboza this is the December 30th card and then Jimmy Rivera and John Linacre whoa that's something that people are sleeping on that is a good fucking I don't know too much about Jimmie Rivera he's very good who's he very good he beat you I favor he was one of your eyes last fights the second last fight she cook on Jimmy's record but he's only got one loss in his career who's he got oh yeah he beat Thomas Almeida he beat up Thomas Almeida it was a really good fight too before that Uriah favori beats him iuri Alcantara beats him pedro muñoz beats him and he knocked out Marcus per image and I think he's I think that was his debut is that right does it say that it's a filete history it says full history yeah so he knocked out Marcus in his UFC debut he's very good man very very tough it's interesting because he comes from a chain too he's from Tiger Shulman's Tiger Shulman's is a really respected name in MMA right now they're really good really good real good trainers real good fighters coming out of there but it's it was always like did you you have chains out here and the west coast did you guys have like karate chains world of chains Tiger Schulman had quite a few gems east coast yeah but a lot of gems man I don't know how many he's got now but I want to say it's definitely more than one and it was like a known name in the karate world you know and then when MMA came around they adapted they adapted and they put out some real good fighters remember Luis god no the kid with the green hair he fought out of there too I don't remember him this is good fight the green hair didn't work well you know Carlos Condit returning against Neil Magny that's very interesting but I'll tell you what man Neil Magny was the first fight where I realized how goddamn good ha felled ossandra says it welterweight when dos on just kicked his legs out from under him got him to the ground and smushed him and submitted him I was like holy shit some guys that wake cut is just too much and dos Anjos had definitely crossed over into the too much territory I mean in my mind he's one of the best right now for sure at 170 pounds there's so many good matchups at 170 man so many not too many fighters go up in weight and dominate like that not like that not just dominate but dominate a former world champion who just came off of a convincing victory over Donald Cerrone you know Rob he's not he's not shot by any stretch of the imagination that's not what it was this is what was most impressive about it robbie was in there to the very end I mean he was bobbin and Weavin when he was getting hit with those shots he never gave up he gave it his all and he wasn't diminished he just got out fought he got out leg kicked he got out worked that fucking dude's got some crazy cardio I mean ha failed dos Anjos for the barrage that he put see if you can find like some highlights like ha failed dos Anjos versus Robbie law highlights he was just ripping him to the body with ridiculous quantity of strikes carlos condit hasn't fought in a while right long time how long has it been Demian Maia choked him I think those who's lost fine a couple years ago a couple years ago pretty sure do you get hurt and have surgery or so no man I think he was I think he needed a break just put it right in the middle there it's not loading up god damn it YouTube get your shit together anyway doesn't matter just as a lot of a lot of good talent and I'm 170 pound division now it's very interesting Darren till I want to see him get a second fight in the UFC after that cowboy fight I was hoping that he was gonna fight wonderboy Thompson but wonder boy i apparently fucked his hands up in that jorge mosfet i'll fight he heard his thumbs so it's gotta rest up maybe get surgery i don't know what's going on here darren till won't rule out fight with Mike Perry but has Wonder Boy as main priority hmm well Mike Perry just lost in a great fight but pawns and nibby Oh fought a brilliant fight against Perry Perry's a fucking animal though man that guy never stops coming do you see that fight I did but not I didn't see it consistently I was like just looking over at it oh good fight Mike Perry he's the guy who fought Alan right joking yeah joe bond was the first guy to beat him Joe bond beat him by decision and then he's gonna he's been on a winning streak since well he lost this fight and I think he would he I feel like I feel like he won one in between there the Jake Ellenberger fight was after Alan Joe bond wasn't it I don't remember he's dangerous very dangerous if he catches anybody knocks him out I mean he just got to catch it clean if he catches you clean he throws fucked in haymakers super aggressive guy like all dudes with writing above their eyebrows whenever you get tattooed above your eyebrow usually probably a little reckless a little crazy yeah yeah so we'll see here yeah the Jake Ellenberger kayo was right after Alan Jo ban that was crazy the Alex Reyes win streak he had before Alan yep yeah Chung Gulen who's a bad motherfucker he got him by TKO Danny Roberts got him by ko serious fuckin striker man that guy throws bombs I mean he lost but he lost to a really good guy ponds nippy I was fuckin very good and he put that guy in trouble but ponds an MBO had a awesome strategy okay workload great cardio there was a fight we're like both those guys were on the edge a lot they were both very tired there is it was like some serious back-and-forth action what do you think said what's happening next for Rose namajunas that's a good question she's brain still on cloud nine man rematch with maybe but here's the thing I don't know if Johanna can make that wait I think Joanna is struggling real bad to make that what she said why she lost no I mean she gave it all up to two rows I mean Rose Carter but she said she had a real struggle to make that way and she's thinking maybe 125 be better for who knows she fired her nutrition company though that was taking care of her people that were cut and getting her to cut wait for that she said it was a hardest week cut hmm when it comes to people that know how to do that boy there's like there's like four or five different people right now that are like prominent people who's the best at cutting away you hear two guys consistently you hear Dolce and Lockhart that's what you hear consistently here Mike Dolce and George Lockhart Dolce's got a little bit more experience who's Dolce got right now that's good question it's got a lot of people but he's got a real good record you know you look at his record for getting guys on weight for fights he's got a real good record you know who has the worst record [Laughter] how many times is Calvin missed he's missed wife yeah but did he make news with Dolce he made it one who's a Dolce though right I think so yeah just needs to be super regimented you know yeah he's so fucking talented Kelvin is so goddamn talented yeah yes that one to the deal and that I Bisping was like holy shit didn't catch him with the left hook yeah well he caught him with a right jab and then he caught him with a straight left oh that's a snapped his head back it was like but it was he snaps his punches man throws punches there's snap like he's got a very interesting punching style like he catches guys like at the very end of his shots man I mean it's it's really interesting - coming from that southpaw position Payne look at that come on man powerful fucking super powerful and a good wrestler - that's what a lot of people forget one of the reasons why he could strike so good as he's so fucking hard to take down remember when he won against your riot Hall yeah he's been working with Marvin my black belt Marvin counts down he's been doing some serious training with them the Cerebrus yeah the Cerebus the Cerebus remember that oh I know that guy is he's got nasty a man re-roll well he's got that like 12 million views or whatever yeah and flow grappling yeah Marvin is probably at headquarters the hardest trainer I mean he he's always drew and always teaching teaching privates drill and his boys he's got his own crew the break squad having about seven guys and man their training on Sundays doing doubles on Sundays every day hey Lou that's amazing he lives it yeah and he's hustling to putting out seminars training camps he's got his dark arts seminars when he teaches the classes dark arts just because he's you know he's got all kind of game but he does specialize in his own he's got his own special myclock game and no one else is doing it's it's pretty extraordinary hmm and he's the best at it and he's teaching he's got all his his crew that he's teaching and I've actually implemented that into the curriculum we practice his best I put it I put it right in directly instead of 'crazy IG Jitsu has no end there's like noon waves and new techniques and new variations and new improvements and new defenses and has no end the amount of ways you can intertwine and entangle to human beings and in different angles it's it really is endless I know there's I mean there's so many different styles of just leg locks just leg locks alone is its take a lifetime to master so much and over the last four years it's just exploded I mean since since EBI one when the Danaher death squad came in and just started dominating boom that's when the leg lock came just exploded it was always around because at Abu Dhabi and I Dean Lister was crushing people with heel hooks and so is venom on glass they've always been around but I think maybe people thought okay Dean Lister is leg lock and dudes because he's so strong and so big and Paul Harris is leg lock and everybody because he's so big and strong just ripping legs apart um you know that and I think people looked at that like maybe it's not a small man sport leglocks and even early in MMA like big diligence you know but when you see guys like Eddie Cummins and you know he's not big at all he cuts down to 135 he's the 145 champ but what does he work around he leg locks dudes that are 250 pounds to leg lock anybody that's people are afraid of him they're afraid of it he's so good at leg locks people are fucking they run from it well they have such a good system Danaher system do you ever do you know what Danaher system do you talk to him about it he's very secretive about it and that's a good move you know that that's part of the reason they're dominating the sub only scene you know they're very secretive but you know we we take what they do and we add it to the game and we dissect their game we dissect you know Marcelo Garcia's game we dissect anybody's game who's who's legit Donna has got a great Instagram page to break it down stuff breaking down his technique he's a genius I mean look at all those guys you know you got Eddie Cummings Gordon Ryan thank you Brian Gary tone and Nicky Ryan and then the guys from Tristar which are affiliated with them too like Ethan Krell isn't Stan I was in SES B just P did a lot of training with them yep yep and Oliver tazza he's awesome they got a lot their crew they're deep and they're not just good at leg locks they're good at everything they're good at passing you know they're passing people's guards in Abu Dhabi yeah but look at when George choked out Bisping when was the last time you saw a rear naked choke that tight yeah that was tight right away in a world title fight that we slapped on it was like you know sometimes you'll see like a lot I like hand to the back of the head type shit that was just super sunk in and tight yeah the you know or riot rivalry with them ten planet and dds is only but you know it's only because they're so goddamn good you know we're trying to catch them right now in the sub only game no doubt there are the best and we're trying to catch them so if we catch them or not you know for if we surpass them or not it regardless we're gonna be as good as we can bet we're getting better and better and what's about you you need someone like that like the sport needs someone like that to have a team that's that dominant it's great for the whole game because then you realize like wow this is possible and you got to take it to the next level yeah they're elevating everybody's game and when gob Eddie Cummings that was it was so huge for me and for everybody attempt it was so huge only because they were so dominant yeah you know it's like you know that it was just incredible so the the rivalry we got going it's just making us all better and it's just elevating the game it's making us better it's making our leglocks better and and we're even taking you know some of their passing and their back attacks - so who is out of jiu-jitsu out of high-level jiu-jitsu has got like a real promise in MMA right now cuz isn't Garrick tonin about to fight an MMA match Gary tonin who won EBI four times I think I think ed which is a lot and he only has one loss and EBI he's been super dominant he's about to fight for one of he signed a contract with shot tree so that's going down I think his first fight maybe in March maybe you know as long as long as they bring him along slowly no doubt he's gonna make some noise and Crone's still fight for Rison right is he fighting for eysan he fought for eysan in his last fight but i don't know what's going on currently with his contract have no idea it's been a while it's been over a year maybe since his last fight so I don't know and when he was on my podcast he made it clear that he he at the very least wasn't certain where he was gonna go with mm-hmm he talked about how that the training and the lifestyle is just not fun then I I just beat a guy and I'm like this is this wasn't fun I mean so he's not maybe he needs time off you know cuz he's at all the pressure of being Hickson son and there's so much pressure that come can you imagine the pressure you know he's fighting imagine he's fighting an ABC C you know all that pressure he cannot get stomped he gets stomped he's got to deal with like how his dad feels and you know that fucks with people's heads there's so much pressure I just wanna see that kind of level of jiu-jitsu like when like when Brian Ortega fought Cubs worse that guy right there Brian Ortega that guy he is right up there with all the best jujitsu players in the UFC right now he's right up there with gaming Maya right there I mean that guy is finishing fights with jiu-jitsu consistently and he just took you know what what you what he did in his last fight with that that against couple cups once and we when he just took just your basic ass front headlock had an army just takes that and just closes the show with that now there are many people can do that and adjusted his hands yeah the he was hanging on he had an arm in faked like he was going all neck marcella teen and then went back because as he faked it loosened up the guillotine so I went back boom and then he he was just a little fake oh that's interesting yeah oh he faked and went back into it has the guy on the bottom he knows he's caught an arm and guillotine and he knows okay I'm safe here but look there's a little opening if he switches really quick there's a Marcella team there so you're always watching it so when he went he adjusted but he went back and got in deeper with the arm and that's that's what I haven't talked to him personally about it but to me that's what it looked like I watched it over and over that looked like a little fakie I'd had an arm fake the Marcella teen and went back in and deep in any song the level of squeeze and clinch that's needed to pull that out on Cub Swanson Cub Swanson is high level jujitsu he's one of the best jujitsu guys in the UFC he's right up to his jujitsu really really good really good and to to pull that guillotine off on him and standing that there's so much there's there's so much technique going on and we almost got that darks was a tad arson anaconda was it a Japanese necktie what did he almost get in the first round it was tough to see that again he was in some weird position where it looked like he was trying to seal up a darts but either way yeah yeah I think was a darthian cop Swanson this guy's closing the show fast those are all very simple chokes to learn the Darth the arm and guillotine the Marcela teen the Japanese necktie there oh that's the that's the easiest part of the technique is just learning how to do it that's the easiest part the hard part is mastering it that's the hard part easy you could learn a garment guillotine in in three minutes anybody can it's really easy to learn there's not it's not trigonometry but mastering it that's what's hard like you would think like why isn't there more guys like Brian Ortega out there just taking a little simple front headlock swith had an arm and then taking it home there ain't that many because the amount it's just like a Muay Thai plumb clinch you know so easy you could learn a Muay Thai plum crunch in 30 seconds really really easy but actually manhandling a professional fighter with it the amount of time that you need to craft that clench and polish it there's so you actually need physical time you have to yet the it's not gonna happen on its own remember when Anderson grabbed Rich Franklin you could see right away like whoa this is a different kind of Thai clinch remember yeah I did every yeah every now and then you see a fighter utilize just a plumb clinch and be really effective with it someone recently I forgot who was using it in that in the UFC last week I forgot but who was it wasn't dos Anjos was it yes it was dis on us that's right it was him and he comes from you know Rafael Cordeiro how much time are you spending developing that plumb clinch that Muay Thai clinch if you if that is not in your curriculum that is not going to be something that people are gonna be fearing you actually have to put time into it it isn't about learning and it's about mastering it so what's about developing strength in that one particular movie just like the same way like some guys control a nasty left hook to the body because they just have ridiculous pores you take the average athlete and have him throw a left hook it's a awkward punch to throw but you get a guy like triple G he's been doing it so long that neural pathways so smooth and car he just fit he just digs that thing it's the same thing with chokes you see with Brian thing same thing with Brian also with his triangles man yes his fucking guard you need a dish that needs special time to has mmm has nothing to do with the time you spent on the front headlock and Ryan and taking that all the way home and closing the show just from the front headlock Nicole Brina did it against AJ AGA's arm in in Abu Dhabi in AJ wrestled in college Kareena and wrestle but at this point he is like a college wrestler Cobra has been rusting so long he could wrestle with college wrestlers yeah AJ wasn't gonna take him down AJ is a college wrestler like legit and he's not gonna take ko bringing it down Cabana it's like you know capoeira master show kobrine a shot in on AJ and got a single Wow and then dragged him in but but he had a single AJ was hopping on one foot and then he would drag him down like run the pipe with it and AJ is such a professional he gets put to the ground but then pops right back up now he's hopping on one leg again he has a single and then Kareena does it again boom he drags him down and then AJ like a professional ninja he pops up again how the fuck is AJ even walking after that Gary tonin about real quick this is on that front headlock then Kareena he realized okay he sees what's going on he knows that he fucking he still has the single he still has controlled I go in Chico Brina has he he captured him it's not just a regular scene he captured an Ajay can't pull that leg off he can't complete the takedown but he ain't pulling the leg out that clinch kobrine is so strong right so then Kareena does it again he drags him down to the ground and then before he could pop up he lets go let's go and jumps on a front headlock and he has a cradle on a front headlock and then boom and that's it he's not letting go that there's really not that much there but you know what it's a starting point the actual real starting point was that single that clinch on the city submit him he captured him yeah um and he got his back he slowly he had the front headlock with the cradle and then he sprawled on him for a while maybe a couple minutes and then slowly jumped on his back he took him out like a real anaconda and that all those positions every step just a little single holding a leg on a single most people can't even hold it and a guy with a limp leg out and start again they start fresh and reset most guys could get in there and hold that single for just a little bit it's only a little clinch little tiny clinches or a little second here two seconds here there is a little risk control but when Cabrini gets in there and clinches on that leg he couldn't pull it out and then he jumped on the front headlock and then he wasn't gonna a lot of dues you put a front headlock on most guys you could peel that shit off and get off my fucking neck easily but there's levels like we always say there we always say that because that's what it's all about you have to remind people there's levels to every movement and you just keep getting better and then levels to chaining the movements that's a different it's different you know and then boom you put another movement well how what level are you on this part that we're gonna connect that's a whole different level hmm that's a whole different part another piece everything needs to be every pathway in jiu-jitsu there it could be super long or short but man there's some pathways that like for instance you can um capture someone in quarter guard that's your first more like this is a path a normal path all I'm trying to do is just capture the guy and the worst capture is quarter guard that's the worst guard Africa's anything worse than quarter guard where you're just controlling his ankle there's half guard you control the leg full guard you're controlling his whole body is between your legs that's fool God half of that is you only have control of one of his legs and in quarter guard is your you're almost losing that leg you got the ankle that's the worst guard once you lose control that he passes your guard or you have nothing you have nothing so you capture that ankle you're in court of guard and then use a mini stomp that's a technique a series of techniques to get to the lockdown which is a form of half guard and then from the lockdown how are we gonna get the full guard so it's a little climbed ankle full leg now I got your full body now we're gonna attack and then from there it's a whole new sport starts you got him in full guard now that's all what you did before has nothing to do with this is a whole new level it's like a video again now I got him in full guard man that took a while but I finally got him here and that's the whole strategy strategy in the whole plan if anything would have failed and I didn't get full guard then you try to sweep and try to get on top of them on the bottom use half guard suits get the dog fine electric chair electric stone reverse lock down a lot of stuff you could do butterfly sweeps over hook boom I couldn't get full guard but look I swept you now I'm on top now we pass the guard set them up put them in the truck from the truck it's not working out tables bad people try to know what you're talking about there's all these steps yeah you nothing's happened in the truck take the back down I can spend that much time on the back I'm going to spiderweb spider web that's it we're first and goal on the one it's not looking good for you and there were so many things that had you had a chain together mmm for that to happen all those moves that sound crazy you got a chain all those moves together to make it happen you know that's that's um that takes a long time they should teach that shit in high school they really should what jujitsu they make kids a lot nicer I believe so I think so makes them a lot more humble or more humble but also more realizing that a lot of the bullshit and the insecurities you can get that out of your system yeah train you know yeah a lot of pressure though not sure but yeah the pressure everybody would be cooler with each other jujitsu it's competition every night that's a different kind of pressure so if you can handle that if you could handle if your ego can handle the competition every night it's Abu Dhabi every night if you can handle and you go in there I don't care if I get beat by these guys I care about the guys that are on the streets these guys in this jujitsu club there are a little computer nerds I'm not worried about them either they're gonna be nice to you yeah I don't care if they tell me yeah one day I'm gonna be able to do that dude what they did to me I'm someone that just walked in the door that's that's the attitude you need you need that attitude like people take the tapping when they go in till you get to two seriously and there is that that's why it's so much fun that's why it's exhilarating and exciting because they don't want you to do it yeah exactly and then when you tap someone out and makes it makes it so much better the fear of getting tapped or whatever maybe you don't call it fear but I guess you could but that in itself makes the tap feel better so it's worth it you got to have both can't have heaven without the hell so that's what makes it exciting life itself though it's oh yeah microcosm yeah exactly it's like all the shit that's going on in the world it's like maybe this is we're here for the pain maybe it's supposed to be fucked up and we're supposed to learn how to survive in this fucked up world you know I don't know if we're supposed to but we definitely appreciate good things more when we see bad things yes maybe we like yet struggle struggles real yeah when you think about like you know getting that says let's just say you were a politician or some or a person that that were like a truth or whatever and then you're thinking about man what if I get suicided you know do you really think like that no I'm not I'm just saying but you brought you brought that up many times about like Hillary Clinton yeah do you mind how many people criticize Hillary Clinton unless you're working for the DNC you don't have to worry but if you like if you but if you're sending some shit to WikiLeaks yeah people get suicided you know what is it just vanished what people fight that people are fighting the extreme corruption going on and there's so many layers but what's worse getting suicided by somebody in the DNC has someone ordered a suicide hit on you or getting eaten by a great white shark in south Africa like what how would you rather go does it really matter might suck because it might cut you in half yeah but you're not there's not people out there you're not going out there fighting to kill all sharks you know you're not trying to end sharks you know so maybe it's maybe we're supposed to be in all this shit and we're supposed to try to figure it out maybe the bad motivates the good you know I'd honestly believe that this got to be some opposing forces in this world for things to get done it's not that I necessarily want to see evil but I think there's a there's definitely some sort of an equation going on there's good at look at movies movies always have to have some kind of conflict Lois oh it's otherwise you're not gonna watch it it's almost like we that's how this all works is there's gonna be evil motherfuckers here and there's gonna be good people like what side do you want to play and maybe you're not supposed to try to fight the evil just try to survive around it you know I gotta pee so bad we have to end this but uh tell me when again is the next EBI so people can get it on it's on UFC fight pass now yep UFC fight pass the next you can watch the last you know EBI 1 through 14 on the UFC fight pass the next one EBI 15 the featherweights
