hello freak bitches so if you start if you take a guitar string and you split it into four equal parts you put your finger over one quarter of the string and then you start just plucking the string and hovering above the string so you don't actually push it to the fretboard those notes occur naturally as the harmonics in the expansion of the vibrating string so that those notes were not really chosen by Roy Orbison or whoever wrote the song they were really chosen by like a Fourier series and it feels like it's a riff but I discovered this when I was in Indonesia as I would start playing that and people would react I thought like why that song what about more complex creative and sort of improvisational song like voodoo child from Hendrix so I don't know about voodoo child I mean well you take taking out and it changes up so I if you look at the first couple of chords of red house there's like some seventh or diminished chord mm-hmm and like he's arpeggiating Nana and then he moves it down a half step which has to do with this tritone substitution and the symmetry inside of the seventh chord so if I recall correctly you have a chord like ceg b-flat would be a c7 chord and the E and they b-flat would form this thing called a tritone and now if you went in the blues either three elements of the chord progression the dominant sub-dominant and the tonic if you go down a half step you effectively invert the third in the flat seventh so if you go one half-step below that it's the flat seventh and the third I think of the subdominant chord so Hendrix is actually playing with math mm-hmm in something as basic as do you think he's aware of it or do you think he's doing it sort of just instinctual well first of all when you're visited by an alien intelligence we went through cuttlefish and we now Jimmy so it you know that's like these are the these are the best alien sightings we have right it's very hard to speculate but I I just looked at everything I've been able to understand about what he did and you you know you're dealing with a super mind as well as an intuitive right mastery master of the instrument complete understanding of the chords and progressions and just the ability to improvise and to make it sound different adding the wah wah pedal and all that distortion and all the shit that used to Dan the fact that he imparts more into one note like I wouldn't even know how to notate I mean what is even the instrument you didn't play the guitar he played the guitar amplification you know signal processing system as a whole yeah so you know there are these people who are just in some multi dimensional space another one of my favorites is a guy named Roy Buchanan who somehow these guys who understand harmonics gravitate to Telecasters and you know pull up song called Roy's blues and watch him just go into the multiverse and start playing with things that you can't even imagine are possible so I do think that that there's a very close relationship between algorithms and emotion and I wait but wait with Harvey he was the guy that would give girls the shoulder rubs he would tell them to massage him oh he massaged them good massage him he would do according to these girls I don't know if it's true but he'd be the guy that I'll be right back and he comes back in a bathrobe he's a bathrobe guy so here's the thing I mean to make light of anybody sexual assault or whatever it was or harassment but other work on the roof again wonderful but but what I but here's the thing how many women said yes that's Lee a fuckload oh yeah that was his move what we're seeing is his missed pitches right right he had a lot of fucking triples and home runs knocked a lot of balls out of the park but occasionally he was whipping occasionally he was like I got this one of the back boys and she's like fuck off Pig he's like oh come on just come back to my room no no it's like shit Darby I wasn't connecting I wasn't connecting but listen I got all this as a girl wants to be in the next fucking this movie and avatar 16 and alright and she's willing to do the thing to get the part and that's kind of okay yeah then it's like that guys they can get the part and get your money and get on with it how many girls read the story when it broke and could still taste the asparagus caviar flavored come just the cocaine vodka in his loads I bet he has like a Flemmi like Monique on the white spittle and the corners of his mouth when he talked to you when I was trying to hit on you yeah that's a gluttonous man yes out of control it's not attractive it's definitely not my favorite too is that he would jerk off into did you hear this this but that's such a desperate thing like come here can we get it can I have it no okay stay here then let me you know like it's so maybe was hoping they would just dive on the grade thank you but I'm also like I was thinking -
