stuff and and and that's what really got me to do it scroll one up let's look at that white guy dance move okay dad yeah yeah that's true just listening to yourself what really geeked me out and the name DJ dad mouth came because he was becoming a father at the time and I was like you're like way lame bro me a dad yeah and then it kind of morphed into DJ dad that's true oh that's true but taking it on to morning news was like funny that was like so fun it was like all the time you know so when you went on as a one time goof did you have a plan or did you do not really what you do I was just like the fun thing was to go was when cuz I had the thing I hate the most we do them when they're like what can audiences expect this weekend they always say though I hate that and I'm like a fucking show jokes yeah what do you talk about yeah what's what's what's bothering you right now Tom yeah that's the setup tell what's going on your life and they think yous good like and then they go just do whatever you want like just have fun with it so when they do that I was just like it's not really I don't really give a fuck about comedy and then they're like what I'm like it's about the after-party you know I'm gonna be DJing right here just a goof yeah because it was fun to have her and be like alright right you are at the funny bone right am i coming for a minute then you have the funny bones sitting right there off-camera like what are you panicking the best part is when he sets up like the really cheesy anchors to ask him stupid questions yeah like did you oh you had someone do the bird as fat thing I had that was the best one yeah you know if you ever act sometimes when you go hey you know ask me about farts or something right so be like like so they they know not to they they check themselves on asking something provocative or that's not 100% PG so I didn't know how I would go but I go oh ask me what birds so fat and the lady goes okay and and then so we just are in the middle of this interview she goes why bird so fat that's a good question like I just rolled with it you know and then it grew and then a hot dog eating champion a guy that was in Nathan's go and she placed Sydney place yeah he's like one of the he was like a super competitive eater like a Kobayashi dude yeah yes this guy this guy whose side you play the audio on this it's incredible life-changing stuff eight months he drops a hundred pounds my cheap light day for the year which arrived two giant inspirations first my wife that's alright second anniversary or I want to say hi to her and there's a comedian I love he's a big giant fat guy just like me Burt Chrysler we're talking about this woman we didn't talk about too much but we should this woman who was the woman that Hillary Clinton brought up during the Trump debate because she was saying that Donald Trump humiliated this woman cuz he shamed her and humiliated her because she gained weight while she was a Miss Olympia oh I miss the subs in the bathroom and you guys had she got up to 170 pounds according to trump she went up from like 120 to 170 according to him probably not right how he gained like 30 pounds but apparently she really did gain a fuckload of weight and then Hillary Clinton made this big deal about like how awful it was he did that to her and then they have these commercials already planned for the next day so they launched these commercials the next day and in the commercials they show this woman she's speaking in Spanish talking about Donald Trump is terrible what he did to me he made me feel bad he made me he was scared so then after that comes out people start researching her they find out that she drove a getaway car in a murder that she threatened a drudge because the judge who was going after her boyfriend at the time that she drove away in the getaway car she threatened the judge said that she was gonna kill the judge she had an illegitimate baby with a Mexican kingpin drug dealer all of the Mexican drug cartel kingpins came to the baby's christening then she went on Big Brother okay big brother she was engaged to some baseball player went on Big Brother and fuck some other guy on the show while the cameras were on her and she was yelling out in Spanish that he has a magnificent kind Wow the same lady that I used in our commercials drink them so then they have around CNN my gosh so Anderson Cooper interviews are on CNN's Anderson Cooper says um some people are saying that you threatened a judge and that you drove a getaway car like is this true sir everybody have it pass okay I'm not an angel I'm not a bad person but they're trying to take away from what he P what he did was wrong okay what I did was 20 years ago what he did was 20 years ago to him all he did was cut in fat yeah but in his defense when she probably was she got fat she these pictures of her she definitely got fat you know ordinarily that's a very rude thing to do but when your job is to be a professional hot chick it's like if you just decide say like if you're a model for like a shaving cream like if you like your your whole things about your legs your legs like I touched the mics are boom but you're things about your the sleek smooth legs and you like knew what fuck it I'm letting these bitches grow and it was a hey um you can't your job is to have sleek smooth legs oh my god you're known for your nice flakes yeah but she's known for being a professional attractive woman and you know that he shouldn't objectify women that is the whole point of being Miss Olympia so Hillary paid her to do obviously if she's an anti-trump commercial then that means hillary paid her right um might not be money it might just be attention because it gave her the opportunity to get back in the limelight apparently she's a giant attention whore gotcha [Music]
