hello freak bitches with as Michael Phelps listen to who might be damned yeah he doesn't give a fuck that is weird but I think you just gotta be that guy if you want to be that good who else is as good as him nobody ever right who else is that intense nobody nobody he takes it all over the next level goddamn crazy people out there win gold medals pretty fucking impressive smokes a lot of weed I hear ya so being a weed did you hear about the DEA this morning that really pissed me off they decided not to reclassify marijuana what sort of keeping it in the same category as heroin and yeah stuff they decided that it has no medical benefits why can't we just take him to one of these kids that have you know seizures and just go here watch cease seizure now see no seizure okay shut the fuck up you know common sense knows common sense right yeah I mean that's that's definitely evidence but I mean there's many many cases of that that is evidence that there's there's tests being done on these children in the real world and it's working I mean whether or not it's scientific you know double-blind placebo-controlled evidence no but there's plenty of evidence about the medicinal benefits of cannabis there's plenty of it there's plenty there's there's all sorts of data that seems to indicate that it has some sort of a role in reducing tumors it can it definitely helps people with anxiety there's there's a lot of factors that it does that like I know when Neal Brennan was on who's talking about antidepressants and he was like they don't exactly know how they work and that's a really good point but they sell a fucking ton of different kinds antidepressants they know how cannabis works they know that there's cannabinoid receptors in a human mind meaning the human brain is designed or grew up or developed alongside cannabis it knows what to do with it so when you take marijuana your body knows what it is your body even produces some sort of cannabinoid response when you run that's part of what you're getting in the runner's high they say it's similar is that correct I think that's correct how is this a true statement that they add in there that they don't know that drugs chemistry is not known or reproducible says no current use because the drugs chemistry is not reproducible not known and reproducible means what what does that mean meaning rug's chemistry is not known and reproduced meaning they can't create it in a lab yeah or they can't make two of the same maybe like you can keep the same cool you can't clone the same person over and over again every time you it's a different person maybe because when you get it as marijuana there's hundreds of different types of cannabinoids apparently and you're not just getting THC you're getting all kinds of a groovy shit in there too yeah I think there's a ton of different types of cannabinoids let's go down a little fucking the information hole in young Jamie how many things I'm gonna guess there's a hundred different types of cannabinoids what do you think I would guess over a thousand I also think it's 12 hours to depending on 85 cannabis contains at least 85 types of cannabinoids many which have documented medical value that was 2014 they probably found new ones bitch okay now there's only over 480 natural components found in the cannabis sativa plant okay there you go so that's different so it's four hundred and eighty natural components so one hundred and thirteen different cannabinoids says one in Wiccan in Wikipedia so you know it's real scroll down one more the one that this is how many different cannabinoids 64 yeah see so it very the answer is vary depending on study in year this is the most recent one right this is 2015 going back to the marijuana thing with the DEA that they had that happen they had to read or do that because the governor got so many signed petitions or signed names that it forced them to have to reclassify the marijuana I don't know what governor but whoever it was you know if they they acquiesced to the demands of the internet right we definitely didn't do enough then so so if more ramped up and they say that they couldn't clap reclassify dad to keep it the same because they couldn't find any health benefits from it right so what happens if the same governor gets all the signatures to reclassify cigarettes or alcohol what would the DEA have to say then for the health benefits of those two would they have to reclassify it as illegal it's a very good point let's try it see what happens I'd love to see what happens it's a very good point it's a very good point and here's another really good point the they're classifying it in schedule one because that's where it's been and because they've claimed there's no known medical use or it can't be reproducible whatever the fuck that means you can grow it dummy you can get clones and grow it of course reproducible it's just reproducible as a plant so what they're saying is they're trying to classify it as a drug what they're almost admitting themselves if what we're thinking is true if what they're saying is that you can't it's not reproducible because it's not a chemical that you can break down into a pill if that's what they're saying like you can't standardize it because it's too wild and it's free it's growing that's almost a perfect example the fact that you're you're not you shouldn't be in a position where you're controlling a plant you shouldn't be in a position where you're regulating nature but that's so you're almost admitting it yourself it's reproduce its not reproducible okay if that's what you're saying then you're saying it's not a drug okay so but it has a psychoactive effect okay now you have to prove that psychoactive effect is dangerous go ahead there's nothing that's the real problem the real problem it's classified in the category of the most dangerous harmful drugs there's no evidence that that's should that that should be correct there's no evidence so that's where the DEA is failing they're failing way more in that than they are in even not admitting that there's medical evidence because if you wanted to follow it to the strictest sense of the word what studies have been done that have absolutely been proven in you know a new modern form of like the most current science what studies have been done that show the medical it's cannabis I love how many studies being done but it's because it's classified as schedule one it's a total catch-22 it's hard to get studies done because it's a Schedule one and so you can't prove it shouldn't be a Schedule one because there's not very many studies but there's a ton of studies that have been done by universities there's a ton of studies that have shown positive benefits if you want to go back in the history even back into the Nixon administration they were running studies that they buried the results because the results showed no harm they showed nothing they can't so when you follow just straight science there's no there's no evidence whatsoever it should be illegal that's the most important thing it's not the evidence of whether it should be legal that's like you know the whole thing about you're innocent until proven guilty it should be the same way about marijuana it should be that you can't just make it illegal and say it has to remain illegal because we don't know what it can do you do know what we can do you do you definitely know why do you think millions of people like it are they all crazy what's going on all these millions and millions of adults that live in America are they fucking crazy so what are you saying you think you're smarter than them why don't you talk about it with somebody that knows what the fuck they're talking about you'll get buried talk about it with a person who's like talk about with like Todd McCormick commander Todd McCormick having a debate was one of these DEA guys about whether or not marijuana is beneficial he survived cancer because of it a lot of people have we have friends that have kids that have autism they give their fucking kids this medical cannabis and all of a sudden they can talk they relax they stop having seizures it's a massive benefit to a lot of people it relaxes people makes people feel good and we have a government agency in 2016 that ignores all of that it wants to keep it in a category of some of the most harmful and dangerous drugs these people are like live in an episode of Hawaii five-o they're living in the past though it's 1950s people and what they think they can do is like keep this this bureaucracy and this paperwork and these classifications in in movement and they can head off freed because what they're trying to do is they're trying to stop freedom and one of the reasons why they try trying to stop freedom is because they benefit from it they benefit from stopping it they have more agents if those eight if all the sudden most drugs are legal what are those fucking thousands of DEA agents gonna do they had they're protecting their own industry this is a natural thing that any organism does when it's threatened and if you start making drugs legal and you start opening up that that conversation like who the fuck is anyone adult to tell any other adult what's good or bad for you when a lot of shit we do whether it's the food we eat the alcohol we drink the cigarettes we smoke the fucking sugar in our diet all these things are bad for us we all know that but we're free who's the government gonna come in with fucking machine guns to stop you from eating a chocolate cake and smoking a cigarette fuck that right I think we all agree on that if you if they can't do that they shouldn't be able to stop you from smoking wheat this is archaic this is like this is some ancient fucking vampire shit and they're clinging to civilization they are totally irrelevant totally irrelevant your decision should be made 100 percent on the facts that are available today you can go you could research all the facts about marijuana you find a few that make correlations between some sort of mental illnesses but those core most of the time at least according to experts that I've listened to talk about it the correlations of schizophrenia to marijuana use are directly in proportionate with the court the numbers of schizophrenia for any given population that there's always going to be around 1% of the population that suffers from some type of schizophrenia or severe mental distraction illness you know a bunch of different categories these little various mental diseases but it's always that number so if they smoked pot that's just a thousand people you know that smoked pot have schizophrenia okay if there was the same amount of people and they didn't smoke pot it might be the same amount of schizophrenics they might not even be connected but when you're talking about 300 million people and you say thirty thousand people got schizophrenia from marijuana are you fucking sure are you really fucking sure or is it 30,000 people have schizophrenia and they also smoke marijuana this is the part this is a real problem with the way that present the data cuz it's just like you coming up to me or to Jamie and you saying that you've got new rules you as a 42 year old grown-ass man you have new rules and we don't want us drinking alcohol anymore you're gonna you're gonna come in and you've hired guards to keep us from smoking alcohol or drinking alcohol it's it's the same thing if it's fifty thousand people with some big building with three letters in the front event or whether it's one crazy fuck who wants to stop his neighbor from smoking pot it's the same thing you're trying to stop someone from doing something that's not bad like you can't do that you don't have any evidence that it's bad there should be a fuckload of evidence it's bad and it should be as much or worse than all the shit that you know is bad that you sell open and make money from taxes alcohol alcohol which we both love I love but here's a great example am i talk a lot they just research released a study that I think this week showing the like they proved scientifically that weed is better for sex and they not only did it for pleasures but they also explained how when you have alcohol you you cheat more you you do bad thing you hook up with people you shouldn't do you don't use condoms you like do a lot of shit that a lot of eeveelutions you like I'm on Team booze let's do this danger style but it's shit that is life changing getting a girl pregnant that you hooked met at a bar that looked hot last night you wake up and it's a dog you know like all the dog you talking about a woman a woman human how dare you know is that all that shaming about SH it's actual dog
