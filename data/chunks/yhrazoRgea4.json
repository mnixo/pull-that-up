the gyro can experience Oh gentlemen I was in the New York during the you know the hurricane sandy and we were talking about before the show but like you got a doomsday prep I mean like unfortunately I prepped for the wrong doomsday right which one did you prep for I don't know invasion of clowns for a good one a good one but annoying like clowns would be everywhere and we have to fight him off with like water guns and stuff like that rappers yeah exactly this was like just fuckin it was like apocalyptic it really was that's hilarious I mean um no much did you expect it to be like that it was it way crazier than expected you know the thing about New York though is since 9/11 like our first responders are like top-notch they really like step up they know what they do they've got plans and all that kind of stuff but nobody I guess expected like New York City tsunami like wave hitting us knocking out power for like two weeks and then there's like Staten Island Jersey where they've got it even harder but you take the power out of New York City and you got Somalia basically it's just a freaky weird scary town you know yeah it's really strange when you see how easy the the film that covers civilization can be removed and people savage it just becomes a survival real so you really have to worry about survival because the first responders are excellent don't get me wrong right they're overwhelmed there's just yes your numbers impossible to deal with there was parts of the city where like I was just walking around and it was just dark and like guys would roll up on you like you can't see him and I'm pretty good like Nick know what's happening I got to roll up on me and I'm like wow this is like a Chuck Norris you know that scene in every Chuck Norris movie was like in the factory right was like a box knocks over yeah it was like that kind of thing like just weird scary faces and just sounds what is it like to walk around a street at night with no gun on it's a no gun no I was like fuck what am I gonna fight him with sarcasm what's going on here so we're walking like to where you how to go to and fro in your neighborhood there was no lights on for days no lights it I where I lived there was lights but when you like we did shows at the Comedy Cellar which is in the village they had no lights up until almost the last day and we were doing chose two generators which is kind of pulling away but bad because it went out when I was on but it went out and all these flashlights and candles started popping out of the crowd it was like that scene in requiem for a dream you know it seemed like weather like ask to ask the flashlight stuff so it was really it was really a freaky show but it was a good show but when you're walking around the streets you're like okay this is like you know what do i what can I fight whoever comes at me with with the weapon and there's a lot of like homeless people coming off of their meds too so there's like they have like the extra evil in them you know oh that's right because they can't get their meds because there's no power it was like zombie style zombie I was what a walking dead kind of shit yeah that's scariest fuck now the Whizzer a lot of that like it was are a lot of muggings was there a lot of it was there was some looting there was some whatever but it wasn't like Katrina cuz I talked to guys who were in Katrina now like you know everybody's like this is art Katrina it's like fuck no this is like Katrina was like the end of the earth that was the end of the world there that was like weeks and weeks and weeks no help you know yeah and no power and it was hot not stuff in New York it was a little bit better than that that's for sure so it's better than that but it's still it was bad it lets you know what can go wrong in the biggest city in the world yeah exactly when that happens when the biggest city in the world gets essentially shut down for two weeks that's a real eye-opener oh absolutely you know like people trying to get into the city and they had to do you know like buses and all the trains were like exactly like somebody shoulda kayak through these tunnels just to do it like to say like I did it I didn't even think about what it must be like at night with no power I didn't even think about my pain inside yeah not have left well you kind of it's kind of like how do you see were you going it's scary so unless it's a full moon how do you see where you've got exactly you know the scariest thing I saw was when I was like driving around like I was in a cab and a cab by the way we're like incredibly hard to get at that point but there was like a candle in a window of a project and I'm like this is what its gonna look like after a nuclear winter like just like one holdout guy in a project somewhere like you know like Charlton Heston in right you know in that Omega Man kind of thing and you know I was like this is it this is what it looks like you know I I was a freak it freaks a lot of people out but then I think the gas thing freaked them out even more the fact they couldn't get gas for their generators and cars and said they're online for like 12 15 hours yeah I talked to a friend who said he was online it was 2:30 in the afternoon he had been there too since 6:00 in the morning you still yeah easily easily yeah that's crazy we never we never I don't think even the government local whatever state thought like there's gonna be a gas problem you know and nobody was ready so wow you need that gas for the generators too so Jesus crisis yeah am i bringing everyone down but it was getting material for a minute all oh yeah I got tons I mean like you know the whole idea of like you know basically doing shows like in New York like the top of the line like guys who pull the most pone or like you know the hedge fund guys you know the club DJ you know the male model who's you know bi or whatever but that week it was all like Renaissance Fairs skills like candle maker blacksmith you know any guy who could hook a bike up to a light you know he would get like you know definitely at least the reach-around you know that's that Yukon man show you ever seen yeah those are important they have generators that work on water flow oh they take a generator they set it up at their camp they have a fish camp and they put this generator they set it up and then they attach these tubes to it and they stick the tubes in the creek and the water coming down the creek goes through the tubes and by the time it you know it focuses in this one area it spins this thing around and starts to generate I want that it's fuckin crazy I watched he pulls the cord and burn it's going on it's not electricity a hundred percent from the creek spinning this generator so as long as this generator keeps working he had his lights on the whole it's crazy and that really is the one thing that you need is like power you know it really is the one thing that separates us from animals well we've somehow or another just accepted that that's gonna be around even though it's only been here for a hundred and fifty years or whatever the hell it's been we were so used to it you know a million years of human beings in a 150 years of power we're just like that's how we do it we got power I could see myself going to my ex-girlfriends house and just hanging out and because she would have like all the candles in the world yeah girls yeah and all doop / handles a girl has is directly proportionate to exactly how long she will cry ft of sex work but yeah girls were prepped a little bit harder than dude handles Mentos you know there's like 30 candles that bitch is gonna cry mom is petroleum based you know whatever girl shit but I have a lot of different things to help you in survival situation exactly and I'll tell you you know who really did not step up for this crisis the dogs of New York City it's like every other person in New York has a dog when it's all these faggoty has little dogs right and I was like they've been genetically built all the cool like wolf qualities that would have helped we're gone so they're like what are we gonna do any food yeah there when the snow hit afterwards no I was already out of there but that was like a one-two punch of like said fuck man a blizzard and the really scary thing is that they're saying who's the Governor Cuomo Andrew Cole yes yeah he's he seems a good guy he said something really interesting he said I don't want to use the term climate change I'm paraphrasing him because it's such a loaded topic he said but you know his father had to deal with in 12 years he had to deal with two major storm events right and he's like I've been here for 12 months and I've had a deal with three Wow you know so he's saying like there's it's very possible something's going on I think there's definitely something going on no that's never happened in New York before well you know a buddy of mine I I assume you know him too big Jay oakerson yes he's a great know of them do you know of him okay yep you probably haven't work with him yet but really funny guys tour with me a couple times his house was wiped out he was like in the flood flood zone zone a whatever he said you know it really is weird like when a flood comes at your house I'm lucky I like lived up you know up in that skyscrapers but the scary part about that is like if the power goes out then you're like trying to kind of stuck up there and so like you know you know whatever happens so you're stuck up to until the water drains out exactly you know that's scary shit skeleton you know basically yeah no Warren I believe in the theory that it was a terrorist attack exactly but I think all the terrors are now hot weather ladies with beards Neptune Laden well your first part made sense the second part just like your Hitler cat with the fucking dynamite strapped to his chest I don't know what you try to happen and a lot of people were just basically milling around a lot of like fires you know on the street like people making fires and grind out on the street right which I think they should allow them to do hell yeah why not you keep a sense of social exact negativeness and yeah it was bad with their food shortages a supermarket question yes like the first night like everybody prepped in terms of like you better buy milk and bread they would say that no can braid all the you know what we call french toast that we make and then like the next day you know you're like okay there'll be more nothing there was nothing left all the people from downtown who didn't have access to food came uptown like a horde and like no no what we call it it was good that they did it cuz they had no food and they kind of swept through all the bodegas and stuff like that so it was like wiped out wow that must have been strange yeah I mean like II always assume in America there's gonna be food you know the other thing is the cell phone towers were downtown so even if you had a cell phone you couldn't call anybody my friend Tommy said he'd draw he drove six hours to make a cell phone call he had I just drive around until he could find service but it was six hours before yeah that's crazy no Coco had service though did you see the video she was posting of her like in the rain with quick o iced teas wife how dare you she's a special bling yeah shit cell phone servers inches is posting these awesome videos of her in the hurricane like rain hitting her while she's wearing like no clothes she's like oh it's so pretty
