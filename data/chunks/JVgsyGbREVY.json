three two one boom you got appreciate a person who shows up with not just food but booze you showed up you brought whiskey and fish that's very impressive that's why it's exactly what my mommy taught me your mother taught you to bring food and booze everywhere well you got a good mom but so your name is you you would introduce yourself as Valentine but your mom calls you Valentin it's what I wanted to choose myself to english-speaking people I say I'm Valentine right but then when I speak to somebody that speaks French I say Valentin Valentin okay because you're from Montreal yes exactly okay so I found out about you online and I've read your story and it's a very interesting story because you you were a lawyer right yes I used to be a lawyer I did my law degree in Montreal and then I did my master in law - before moving to you London and now you are a spear fisher yes full time that's kind of crazy that's an interesting transition and I I'm fascinated by spear fishing it seems like a lot of fun it seems very exciting and dangerous and risky but how did you go from being a lawyer and that's a big jump I mean you got it yet I pay for an education you had to well in Canada do you have to pay for that how's it work um it's kinda cheap compared to the US definitely it's about something maybe like three four thousand dollars a year so comforting to us is almost free yes oh that's not bad three four thousand a year but still that's three four thousand a year for many years that you decided yeah I'm sure my mom definitely didn't get a good return no how do they feel about you doing this um she still sends me university applications time to time being like hey when I used to do something different or something and I'm like no I'm not having a midlife crisis I just don't like what I was doing so I just picked something else oh by the way I'm gonna have to apologize for my English seems perfect not for Montreal so French is my first language something well listen you're way better than George st. Pierre he was here a couple weeks ago and George is more hard to understand and he was fine yeah listen I'm impressed as anybody could speak more than one language I was just in Thailand it's just amazing that they speak English so perfectly you know and then you know their language is so oddly different than ours you decided when to do this like how deep into your your law career were you it was about I actually made a cure switch when I moved to London and she doesn't intend so I started working and finding so I work for hedge funds and I basically decided on a quitting law I didn't like the part of law where I was stuck in one place so you know when you when you study law let's see in Canada then you even in Canada is even worse because I was studying in Quebec which is civil law and then I was stuck and came back the rest of my life and I just got like that's not gonna happen so meaning that okay so like if you pass the bar in California you would also have to pass the bar in New York if you wanted to work in New York exactly okay that's different then is that the same with like if you were a doctor would that be the case um country-wise I would say state wise I couldn't know but state wise it is for law yes it is so for you you would have got stuck in Quebec and Quebec is a very interesting place because it kind of doesn't want to be a part of Canada sure we're very different in Canada but my biggest problem with Quebec is definitely not a culture anything like that it's the fact that it's an 8 month long winter it's rough I'm not doing what the people are amazing it is it's a very European City actually in Canada it's it's people people are very about food about sitting outside yeah shout out to my friends David and Fred from Joe beef in Montreal one of the best restaurants in the world you've read there yes that's a jam in place so I'm sorry so you decided you'd want to be stuck pretty much I kind of got like claustrophobic of being like oh this is gonna be the next 40 years of my life how'd you get into spearfishing um very weird story I was I got into spearfishing when I was living in London which still doesn't make much sense right and then I I'm at this guy and he was like oh you have to try spearfishing would be so good at it and he asked me to go do a course in Egypt the free diving all right I'm gonna go yeah it's very big for free diving eat it really the sea is like very clear and deep and water is beautiful and it's calm very often you can swim from shore and you have a great depth so it's it's really nice for that but so I did my course I went there literally kicking screaming it didn't want to go when I was 14 years old I almost drowned and I saw the France what my parents refused to swim in the ocean for about 10 years after that like if I couldn't see the bottom and who wasn't not even interested in going near the water and then I was like alright I'm gonna try this thing and I go there and I'm like okay it's not too bad no it's not that bad it's actually really cool so he said okay well now that you know how to free dive in three months we're going to this very big spitting trip on Ascension Island session Island is literally one of the biggest most elite spearfishing destination in the world when you go hon for Big Finish it's right ml over the Atlantic it's right between Brazil and Africa it's a military island divided between the US and the UK oh wow I've never heard of it before two people live on it yes they do they have locals that what language do they speak English really yeah it's a very very odd place but is very pretty and it's the one of the bit there is Jamie nailed it got her up there what's the Google Maps tell us how long does it take to get there finish in the middle nowhere that's crazy nowhere Wow it's between Africa and Brazil that's fucking yeah there we had to go to the military base and the in the UK which is like about an hour and a half away from London and we have to take care of rural Air Force flight there that's the only way to get there there's no commercial place real it's a stop over underway from the military base in the UK to the Falklands so how does a civilian get a ride on a military flight they allow about five civilians per flight oh wow so how do you book it or something III didn't do to both King myself but I think he's like through to the air line or something wow there's a weird experience I was imagining like when I was like being strapped down and then facing the other side no it's actually a commercial flight okay guys the movie predator no I was expecting that door was open in a bag and it was like run out and because I have some friends that have done some gigs overseas and they have had to fly in those kind of planes yeah I guess until someone shoots at you yeah that would make a bad day that would change things so when you were free diving before you went to this elite spearfishing destination how long did you hold your breath when I started yeah there's zero probably like 15-20 seconds and so you were going there with 15-20 seconds worth her breath I was pretty bad I just did my deepest dive on my way there was something like 15 meters oh shit I'm Canadian no that's okay it's close enough to yard we understand what this yeah yeah so it was something like that it wasn't that great and actually remember my first time I went spear fishing I was in a boat and the water was really bad he was rocky you don't want to see like black black because it's raining and no huh so I was in the back of the boat I was shaking I was holding my little gun and I was like what the fuck am I doing here I'm like one the watching TV right now like I don't want to be here I don't want to be here don't want to be here and then my friend was like come on stop being you freaky pussy just jump in the boat just then jump in the water and come I don't like I was like okay I think a deep breath I jump in and then the water that was so dark and so horrible and sharp just became super clear and it was fish everywhere and I was like wow this is actually pretty freakin cool and you're doing this again free diving no time for having no no tanks so I took my first show up so I'm a little bit clumsy because I my gun and I'm like I don't really know how to how to dive with that and then I took a shot on my first fish and i stoned it and my friend was like you stoned it me killed it I could live in a first shot yeah that's hunting terms too and yeah and then I my friend was like well you're not done you know you have to grab like the fish have to drag it all the way to the boats and I was like all right I got the fish I have waves in my face and then I get it was kind of big fish it was a big fish wasn't I was a blackjack which is not that great to eat blackjack yeah probably something that many people why wouldn't they eat it it's a it's edible it's not bad it's just not one it's not a very flaky fish I would say it's a little tough that means a little tough oh so it's just too dense or something yeah it kind of it's they're very strong fish so whoa that's cool-looking fish that's what it looks like yeah okay that's a good first fish to do it was about like like 25 pound oh wow your Instagram is filled with this stuff which is I guess one of the ways that I found you I it's hard to remember how I find people online but your Instagram is filled with you with all these cool fucking fish and all these I mean you look like you're living a life of adventure this is one of the reasons why I wanted to talk to you but is that a lionfish it killed yes that's a lionfish you eat those they taste they're probably one of the best a thing tasting fish ever real out there they're fantastic do you ever get them on them are they commercially available do they or is it something Florida yeah you can find them at Publix in Florida oh really which is what I was very surprised about you just have to be really careful when you harvest them of course because if you touch a spine it's is it poisonous yeah very poisonous but it's just painful it's not deadly now you can get into your bloodstream epileptic shot Oh was it gonna happen but normally you just have like if somebody was so many tummies like you had a hammer in your head repeatedly oh it's like a throbbing pain for about a day and a half whoa so like a bullet ant almost it's a paint it's not it's it's you really try to avoid it at all cost no so what would you compare the meat to hogfish I don't know what that tastes like so or maybe a very tiny Chilean sea bass meaning okay that type of like oily flaky did you know that did we talk about this on the podcast Chilean sea bass is not really a bass to Cod it's horseshit it's also endangered is it endangered how's it on every menu if it's endangered so you you go to this one destination you you shoot this black jack will you hooked immediately yes real it was not about a spearfishing part actually I was still traumatized in the water I still had panic attacks when I was in the water and but I fell in love the second I arrived to shore and we barbecued a fish on a beach hmm and I was like okay this is this is for me that's the same exact thing that happened to me when I went deer hunting when we were me and my friend Bryan Callen and Steve Rinella and Dan Doty we were cooking this deer meat by a fire and I was like this is the greatest thing ever because the meat was so fresh because it was like from an animal that was you know literally killed hours ago and then we're eating it by by the fire I was like this is I'm gonna do this forever this is the greatest thing ever primal right it is this you feel you feel what I was call people is that you know when you live in a big city like when I've never experienced that before I've never felt that I was part of the ecosystem whatsoever right and then all sudden I've been putting myself into water when I'm surrounded by sharks or big fish or different things and I'm like wow we're actually not on top of the food chain at all there's a lot of stuff on Buffalo's I can kill us and it's it's it's it's carrying is humbling and I think as a person you have to experience that you have to you have to put yourself out of your conference over to understand that you need to respect what's around you you couldn't tell me 10 years ago oh you have G that fish because it's bad for deer I mean every like yeah sure e buddy right and then you see in a plane you like ooh that looks good and then it's fine and this but then when you're in a water and you see what's going on and you see that a spot you've been diving for five years old southern is empty then it makes you understand that you know we actually have a very strong impact and it's it's our job to understand and and and respect it where we're at we're at ecosystem which is the one that were the smartest one sometimes were the only ones that are consciously aware of our actions and the repercussions yes of our actions what when when you're you know first experiencing this your first time in this feeling of connectedness and freedom and just being a part of the ecosystem did you imagine that somehow no this could be your life in your job not at all I've I've never been hiking I'm not a big fan of I've never used to be a big fan of the outdoors I'm and all of a sudden I was living in London and the nice apartment with two dogs at a nice car and all of sudden I was in freakin Africa I can't being at a bush catching catching my own food and sharing with villagers that had nothing to eat and I was like okay well this is how did that happen like how did you go from this one trip um I got invited to film a documentary and food sourcing and I was like okay I'm gonna try it and I fell in love with it and the second I went back to London I remember sitting in my desk I'd be like there's no way I can do that there's no way I can keep doing that for rest of my life and everybody thought I was completely crazy I sold everything I and I just left I moved away and I have like maybe two suitcases of stuff for the past three years and I was reading somewhere where they were going to do an interview on you and they decided not to they were gonna feature you in something but they decided not to because of concerns for the depletion of fish in the ocean and I said that is the dumbest fucking things I've ever heard because the impact of someone like you what you're doing you for your own personal consumption taking a fish a day or whatever you're getting for your own personal consumption is negligible in comparison to all these people that are probably writing these articles that are going to buy sushi from commercial fishermen they're they're buying fish from the store that's wrapped in saran wrap there and they're completely out of touch now I mean you are in touch you're as in touch as you can get but to think that somehow know that you're doing something evil because you take photos of it and put it on your Instagram who was that one you got it this amazing photo from a couple days ago with you this this big fish it was so fresh and you guys were eating pieces of it you had cut a chunk of out of the out of its tail yes that wasn't Thailand yes it was yeah actually yeah we were just went with this friend of ours with his family and we just went out for today and we went spearfishing with my friend we caught a fish and the guy was super happy he could have right on the spot and all the kids are just picking on it and it was they were so excited yeah second he came that the boat arrived back to the island he just went and grabbed the fish and they were trying to think picture he's a super cute what what was the argument for not what was the piece that they were trying to put you in where they pulled you out of it what was that about that story is it still getting me pretty angry so basically where I was speaking at that woman empowerment conference in New York last May and then when I was actually in Thailand the the the woman that is organizing it calls me and she's like oh look Valentine like I need to talk to you about something and it's you know it's a little touchy I'm like what she's like well one of her sponsors said that if you speak at a conference being on a wood wah their participation and the conference what was the sponsor I'm The Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal and she said yeah they feel like that's your lifestyle is an align with ocean preservation and that's and she said something she didn't say it directly but she and you know me I don't mind that you have pictures unabating see I'm like what do you mean picture my panics you sorry my burqini was not clean like what do you want from me I know the beach but am I supposed to wear your also swimming I'm swimming in a bathing suit you mean it's not like you're in your high heels you know being an insta-mom oh you're wearing a bathing suit and there's nothing wrong with that either but you're wearing a bathing suit because you're actually in the water exactly I'm not in Mykonos next to freaking pool I mean I mean I'm never gonna be sure when it's like 110 degrees I supposed to be on a yacht with Dan Bilzerian respect so so I mean what did you say to them what that's Wall Street Journal that is so crazy you know and I get it from their perspective it's a bullshit argument but from their perspective it's just about optics it's about how it looks that's all it is and if they go there and people love to get outraged about something if they go there and then they go to your Instagram and they find pictures of you with fish they're like well this girl is cleaning out the ocean all by herself yeah I'm very good I mean have you ever seen a commercial fishing boat what they do yes yeah most people have it Jamie see if you could pull off the the horrific effects of commercial net fishing because if you find a video we could watch a clip of the video it's crazy when you see the sheer volume of fish that they pull out of the ocean and when you realize there's countless numbers of these boats and essentially pretty much unregulated and no one's watching them and they're doing it all over the world I mean there's areas where you're not all have fish but overall it's nothing like the way we treat wild mammals or wild birds the way we treat wild mammals especially in North America is they're very closely monitored their numbers their populations we make sure that unless it's an invasive species like wild pigs like here we go this is this is awful they take this gigantic net they sir call these fish and then when they're pulling them in you get to see the sheer volume see as they get close but that's that's that's one of the smoother way to commercial fish mm-hmm France is ready big on on trawlers and it's two kilometers wide net that is actually it's it's scraping the bottom yeah clearly destroying every store in the coral this is Chuck's on each side this is actually a fairly mild one and it looks like they're getting these little tiny fish but me you could find it folks if you wanted to go and google it online but that is the issue to write that these these nets go all the way to the bottom and they destroy anything that they touch like the whole the the bottom of the ocean just gets dragged and all the coral gets destroyed it's extremely destructive but it's what what that's how you get sushi there's so much the fish industry it's not even necessarily how you get sushi it's how you get sushi so damn cheap right but it's it's by the way if we keep doing that it's literally gonna be no fish very very very soon but then how do you explain that and Canada you know how to spear fish what and you have to release most of the fish you ride rail there's a lot of used to release most of the fish you rod and reel yeah in Canada like it like the striper is tribes' and I mean how many can you get a day straight past like one a day or something like one today spearfishing one today and and the US side Canada you don't even touch anything why can't you spearfishing Canada because the anglers association in Canada thinks that were two evils basically that you're evil why because you can't see what you're catching yeah so basically we're the cheaters because we can see the fish and I'm like how can you be in you camping chairs on your boat drinking beers all day tell him you know I'm the cheater when I'm working my ass off driving it like 60 feet to catch my fish to bring it back and I risk my life I risk my life drowning I was my life with sharks I risk my life and all sorts of things that can happen and you're telling me drinking you but wiser you freaking camping chair that I'm the cheetah I'm sorry but no well people always want to think that everybody else is doing it wrong true you know vegans want to thank people that eat meat are doing it wrong people that eat meat want to think vegans are doing it wrong people fish off a boat want to think the people spear fish are doing it wrong you think they're probably doing it wrong now I have nothing again catching you on food as long as you you know respectful with the way you do it mm-hmm but there was a big scandal in Florida for the past years with the Brett snapper by example and it was about like recursion or recreational fishing you allow a certain amount of red snapper and then a season closes and when a season closes as an individual my license to fish is gone and then they give it away to the commercial fishermen and I'm like whoa so basically are you telling me that I'm not allowed to catch that fish for a few months because the population is too bad but then you given my quota to the commercial boat started catching hundreds a day they're like yeah that doesn't make any sense no it doesn't but most people are not gonna spear fish most people are gonna fish so they don't you guys don't have a voice right in terms of like representative voice comes to creating these laws and establishing these these rules there's not that many of you oh we're right and the food chain where the weirder plankton is you know you had a commercial fishing with very big lobbyists and a lot of money and then you have the anglers which is a little bit it's still not super bad because it still have big boats company and equipment is still like if the market which is good enough and then you have this river shipment right specimens were not a lot in the world I couldn't even tell you how many but we're not we're not a million that's for freaking sure it's probably less spearfisherman than there are bowhunters that's highly possible yeah I would imagine because it seems more dangerous and difficult than bow hunting seems like the next level seems like one of the most difficult things you can do if you want to get your food it's cuz you're going into an alien environment and you're holding your breath true but actually the human body that's the main argument I get from people they tell me oh I could never do it but every the human body is actually made to do this so there's a thing called the mammalian dive reflex and this is very present in aquatic mammals such as like it like you dolphins your sails and things like that and the human have it and a very and a way weaker way but we still have it and so when you immerse you your face on the water your heartbeat is that to matically gonna slow down especially if the water is colder so you body's as you're getting prepared to hold its breath to catch food and that's that's a new DNA is it preparing to catch food or is it just preparing to survive to hold your breath so I'm the water right I mean I guess I guess that was a very successive thing to say because it's I'm seeing catch food but I just don't see why or no worry being genetically would have to go underwater are you aware of the aquatic ape theory nope it's a very controversial theory but the theory is that we evolved somehow or another like you know dolphins apparently were at one point in time a land animal that crew is that right we're dolphins a land animal at one point Tom know if that's true I might have made that up but the idea was that humans were the only ape that grew up in close proximity to water to the point where we evolved in the water dolphins may have remains of legs yeah okay fossil remains shows dolphins and whales were four footed land animals about 50 million years ago and share the same common ancestors as hippos and deer whoa scientists believe that they later transitioned to an aquatic lifestyle but their hind limbs disappeared okay so this is fairly recent if you think about evolutionary terms you know the dinosaurs were killed 65 million years ago so inside of that 15 million years later they were walking around which is fucking nuts they were like hippo they think so Google do look at that what they used to look like what the fuck man Google aquatic ape theory I don't know enough about this to really speak on it but that has never stopped me in the past this this theory is that one of the reasons why they think humans have so much fat on us when we're babies is that we float easier and that if you take a human baby you chuck them in the water okay well how about an actual article not a picture this cartoon but it's actually it's not it's not even just about you hardly slowing down there's a bunch of things that happens and you like crazy things babies know how to hold their breath they instantly hold their breath when you that's like their Nirvana album cover that's what I'm talking about reports that some humans don't bleach ildren under-five may also use this reflex to survive prolonged submersion the mammalian dive reflex was developed the xix theory was developed in 1960s an explanation for well publicized survival of exceptional submersion times of some near drowning victims but um see if there's anything like an actual article that makes sense on the aquatic ape theory there's a new aquatic ape theory okay hmm okay okay the aquatic ape theory now largely dismissed tries to explain the origins of many humankind unique traits popular as the 1970s 1980s by writer Elaine Morgan the theory suggests that early hominids lived in water at least part of the time the aquatic life there this aquatic lifestyle supposedly accounts for our hairless bodies which made us more streamline for swimming and diving are upright two-legged walking which made wading easier and our layers of subcutaneous fat which made us better insulated in water think whale blubber the theory even links an aquatic existence to the extinction of humans speak of evolution rather of human speech the hypothesis was met with much criticism blah-blah-blah-blah-blah 2009 richard rang ham of harvard university and colleagues suggested an American Journal of Physical Anthropology that shallow aquatic habitats allowed hominids to thrive in savannas enabling our ancestors to move from tropical forests to open grasslands so from 2.5 million to 1.4 million years ago Africa became drier during certain seasons already dried savannas became even more arid making it difficult for hominids to find adequate food but ragams team suggested that even in this inhospitable environment there were choices wetlands and lake shores and these aquatic habitats water lilies cattails blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so that's the theory the theory is that we like you know obviously there's a bunch of different kinds of primates and some of them are still in trees today those fucking losers we left them behind ha ha those the ones that really dumb people point to if people came from monkeys water monkeys still row we're the ones made cars but that some some of these Apes spent a lot of time in the water and that's why if you ever see a baby chimp they're hard as a rock they're like they're jacked baby chimps like they come out like just like sinewy no body fat and you throw them in the water they drown they don't hold their breath is they don't know what to do they just gag on water and drown not that I know not that I'm throwing chimps in the water that's what they say either a baby person in the water and they hold their breath so this is the that's what that's what it scientists are basically saying about free diving Eunice's this is coming when the first lot sorry when I first learned about it it completely blew my mind how long can you hold your breath now I'm five and a half holy shit but like facing down on the water and not moving and preparation not swimming no not swimming just along a hole if you dive into the water it's like give you what how much time do you give yourself it depends the depth it depends to fish your hunt depends the conditions it depends on a lot of things it's like if you're fighting the water currents it's more difficult yes because basically what you want to do when you free dive is you want to be as calm as possible you want to be as relaxed as you can which is why yoga and meditation are often very close to free diving because if your heart is is high then you good body's gonna need more oxygen mmm that makes sense obviously and but then again the second you emerge your face in the water you do like your first dive and then you feel the pressure your body understands that you're trying to to hold your breath and you need to do that so the blood is gonna start coming from from your fingers you extremities your toes and then your hands you feet so all the other vessels I was gonna start constrict so all the blood flow was gonna go towards your vitals organs so yeah actually your body is getting ready for so they want to make sure that the oxygens goes exactly what needs to be and make sure that you need as as less effort to do anything is possible when you actually underwater now when you first tried holding your breath how long did you do it for your first time I did it yeah I think my first time trying it was about a minute that was like the best you could do yeah no techniques just ready go no no technique like like they you breathe a little bit before even with techniques yeah we're techniques it was it's when you hold your breath you have the buildup of co2 in your body because you're not you know exhaling any mm-hmm and then when your body realizes that there's a buildup it gives you an urge to breathe and then it gives you contracting contractions like diaphragm contractions and this is what makes somebody panics you know like my buddy need hair and you want everyone here and then the more you train then you realize that you're lying under control it and it's not because you body tell you to breathe that you necessarily out of oxygen mmm so how what what techniques do you do to relax that breeding so I do mostly especially when I'm in the water I do a very short inhale so about five seconds and then I do a long inhale maybe 10 to 15 seconds and then when you when you excel you focusing on like everything getting relaxed and then I'm sorry say that again because you said inhale twice oh sorry so you mean - no so you inhale for five seconds and then you excel for 10 to 15 seconds okay so you exhale slowly you exhale super slowly to control the air coming out and then when you do that you get as relaxed as possible and then the more relaxed you are that along with your mama'll diving reflex which is your heart beating slow down naturally you blood shifting from extremities to you final organs and then you also have about a few years ago maybe only 50 years ago they taught that when you reach 20 meters your body would be completely crushed inside that was a scientist would think 30 meters yeah something like that that it was like that the pressure would be so great there that your body would be completely crushed but then again with that with that dive reflex what it does is that that overflow of blood is going around you alveoli and your lungs which prevent dance from crushing your bodies is actually a design machine to go underwater which is completely crazy considering that I've never knew that especially going up and down town Montreal you know and then you put somebody in the water you're like hey you actually pay for that so when people tell me yeah I could never do that it's too hard no no you you're actually born like that so was it like was it a revelation for you mean did you really feel like this is more of Who I am then then the life that I was living before 100% is I had this I was living in London too so it was all about all about you know earning money to buy as many things as possible to try and impress as many people as possible and then at some point I was like wow I I just I cannot do that I cannot spend in my entire life just seeking to buy things and press people I don't like and then when I started spearfishing it really gave me a different perspective on life it gave me them it it humbled me in a way that was so so intense that it changed my it changed my way of thinking completely basically so as I was how did it humble you like my way because I realized that when we were let's say when I'm when I film a documentary and Safin i from a documentary called aqua negra and in cape verde two years ago aqua negra yeah agua does that mean black water yes in Portuguese and then we were there for about five weeks five or six weeks and then the living conditions were really bad and there was no grocery stores around and we had to catch their own food and it was really a self-sufficient type of chip and the first week I remember the only thing I could focus on was oh god this is this is terrible that we don't have a shower there's no hot water bathroom is disgusting I'm starving is nothing around and then all you can thing is like how he comforts gone and after a week that's the the the focus changed on the good things I was seeing around us and by having nothing all of a sudden then I was like oh actually now for the first time in my life can take the time to realize what's good around me and then how we were having fires with the neighbors and then how we were offering and fish and we were thinking oh you know if I give this guy to fish it's gonna eat one today and then one tomorrow but no the inviting me neighbor is to share and they make sure that it was like a whole like community sentence to all of it and I was like wow I've been living in London for six years I don't even know the name of my neighbor and it's it's it's it's bad it's not it's not a way of living that I want it's not focusing in the right things and it's it was that that's in that way you know it's realized how much of how much of an asshole we actually became and I just didn't want to do that well it's a very recent way that people have been living this is this way of living in apartment buildings and way of living in houses where we don't know our neighbors yes in terms of human history it's very recent and I don't think we're designed for it I don't think so either it's the human I do believe that a human being should be happy you need to have the sense of community which is why you know when you go into subway and you see like somebody singing everybody's laughing and you see videos YouTube and he makes you all warm and happy inside yeah it's because that's what we were meant to be you know and it's women to believe with other people we meant to socialize women to have this this this you know the strong feeling of I don't know how to said English um to be part of something to be part of a group and people like that and I'm I do think it's a necessity for a human being should be actually happy I think so too and I think it's probably one of the reasons why so many people are so grossly unhappy and so depressed and so disconnected and they feel alienated even though they live in these giant cities people feel extremely lonely even though there's a lot of people around I mean one of the weirder things about New York City you know our friends live in New York City and one of the things that they say they love is how many people are there it's there's all this energy as well as energy I'm like you know yeah I mean talking to those people that's what's weird it's like you're alienated in this little 1200 foot a little cubicle that you live in you know this little like it's 12 in the foots not that small but you know some of them like Ari's places like I have to ask him I think it's tiny it's probably like half that it's like 600 feet it was probably like five million probably stupid expensive right but the idea is that you don't know anybody around you but you're stacked around all these people and then you go out you're walking around these people but you're not really talking to them and you have a few people that you're friends with maybe that you work with and you interact with them but then you're constantly surrounded by all these other people that you don't even know it's a very weird weird way to live whereas the way you were living the way you were describing this with these people and they're all sharing fish and they're you know you're everyone's taking care of everybody and giving some to their neighbors and sharing and that's how people have been living forever I think there's certain human reward systems that are built into who we are as a being as a species that is aren't being met that's why I'm so fascinated by your choice to go from being a lawyer to living this you know very very interesting life of spearfishing but it's also it's it's not always easy in the sense that I I still haven't found a place where I want to live because it's the society isn't designed for this my lifestyle is very hard to adapt with modern society I struggle with a lot of things I don't know I don't know where to live I don't know because this has a community you can have it in small villages yeah so that's kind of why I've been living in well there anymore but that isn't the Bahamas for a year and I got to experience that's when everybody knows each other everybody talk to each other want to stay there um because for now I guess well I couldn't fuck up with my ex-boyfriend I couldn't live there anymore so I was his house all right about so but is I I just I don't know it's I still need you know to survive isolate yeah I catch a lot of my own food and my freezers literally full to just rim but I still need money to live right how how do you make money um I get a few things I'm working right now on a cookbook and a TV show with a Canadian company do you make any money off your Instagram page uh yeah sometimes cuz some people do write sometimes how do you do that how do you make money off your Instagram sponsors and different things like that I just don't like being like hey drink my detox tea oh yeah I skinny tea I just I just I just don't like doing that and yeah problem also is like it was two years ago I was a super big contract with a cruciate company they need a girl to like they need a freediving goal and we're not that many of us so when they hired me I did about a week later she calls me back she's like I'm sorry we can't hire you anymore I'm like what why and she says because we're partnered with WWF and or marketing or marketing department and said that you raised a red flag because you spear fish for a living WWF the wrestling WWE W that like the Panda one like the what the one with the Panda when they made him change the name of WWE the worldwide yeah that's what used to be okay what do you say is that what you're saying the wrestling pro wrestling no no no the eco-friendly then dependent World Wildlife Federation yeah oh they made them change their name that's why they changed their name oh I thought they changed your name because of a lawsuit because they they had to show that they were entertainment huh so WWF owned it I really thought that it was just because of regulations WWF yeah so so basically yeah they said like oh because we really want to keep or eco-friendly wow they're fucking boats filled with roast beef and chicken and all sorts of shit meanwhile one across they're allowed I think it's about when you two miles away from the coast you're allowed to dump your garbage in the ocean everything as a cruise ship we allowed to open the trailer and just throw everything in the frickin oh come on is that true it's true that's the law it's the law and they do that of course they do that oh my and that's one of them that's one of the problem how many didn't there five people cruise ship how many destroyer thing to use and glasses because they're too lazy to wash them that's one of the problem in the Bahamas you know you know how much dredging you need to make for a cruise ship a boat to actually pass and dock somewhere you need to rip off the entire bottom of the ocean so it's deep enough it's a very very detrimental Organization for the for the ocean and then they tell me I'm sorry we can't we're with you because you catch you and food and water then what are you bad for the ocean I'm like what I catch my own food I don't buy this disgusting farm salmon from a whole food because it's gross you know you tell me that I'm bad like what most people don't know that farm salmon they dye the fish to make it look orange like if you buy farm salmon and they're not dyeing it would be a white meat because they're not eating what they eat naturally it's bugs certain bugs give them shrimp what is it no it's um pelicans no not pelicans what are those little fucking weird vibes the ones that people have on their lawns salmon is not kale orange it's dark omega for mr. pink because of this shrimp they eat right yeah it literally makes them pink but salmon are dark when they're wild because of their diet their natural diet which includes a lot of bugs I guess yeah they basically feed them in whatever they have like salmon is not supposed to be pale orange right it's dark orange right yeah yeah I've caught wild salmon before it's awesome it sadly with all them the water dam that I'm a for to make electricity you know stuff like Daddy killed out of them well they killed quite a few there was a there's an interesting place in Seattle where you can go and watch the salmon swim upriver there's like a bridge and you go underneath the bridge and they have this setup where these thick glass walls we can actually look into the ocean and watch the salmon go up the Salmon Ladder it's really fascinating so it's crazy to watch them but one of the guys who was there who was a guide was explaining how when they were doing construction and doing various things in their building Seattle they had shut down one of the rivers and these salmon would just get to the mouth of the river where they thought they were supposed to go and fucking die and it was crazy like millions of them died while they were trying to figure out a way to carve this path again yeah we already died to it like rut yeah I went to oh and diving in the ran the Salmon River and NBC and I was underwater with my good friend I could see they had like big stains are like rot on their body yeah like a full live in the ocean and they came to breed one last time yeah and it just rot to death yeah it's very strange yeah and if you catch them too far along the process their bodies already deteriorated like you know I know guys who have caught them and then you can you know they've in survival situations like people eat them because you have to but if you caught them like towards the end of their cycle their bodies like mush literally shove your fingers through it yeah well is but you see that's what that's what people eat but again you know the Walsh general in the Instagram page when they're promoting a recipe for shrimp they're probably coming from Thailand or something that is farming very bad for the environment but then they think that I don't know why there's something ridiculously taboo about catching food yeah it's ridiculous and people imagine you know how I know how bunting has a bad reputation for the blog and and things like that but I mean fishing we deal on top of it would a bunch of lobbyists that are fighting us for the fish at the same time because they want to sell those fish because they want a fish yeah and oh oh we are for them is something in the way and we don't buy their fish at all and because there's so few of you they can they can you know they can shut us down they can say anything that they want about us and we don't have the power to say something back right if they shut down sports fierce spearfishing then where it really wouldn't be much outcry how many Speer Fisher people are there I would lose my shit but well you'd make a post on Instagram I got 5,000 likes um how many Speer Fisher people are in the country let's let's Google just America just nine states how many Speer fit how would you know because do you have to have you don't throw the license for the ocean right um it depends on the state so much to eat slowly that you do you do have to have allies in Florida you do Oh interesting well it's like you know $25 license and I googled that and there's a city called spear fish in South Dakota many populations um how many active just right spear fishermen no disrespect to the spear fish or ladies okay I don't think we count that much and how many spear fishermen are there in the United States it's going back to that state of that city it's going really fast actually sport it is going fast there's like a trend now for people to catch neon food and people are starting slowly because there's so many of big people special celebrities that's I don't know that I'm voicing themself when it comes to fruit sourcing and now people are starting to realize that hunting or spearfishing is actually not as bad it's way better at it but it's just very difficult you know Sports Illustrated there's estimated between 1 million and two million so in the country yeah Holly got it that's a lot of people yeah I guess that's like almost that's close to 1% right there's 3 million people if there's 2 million three hundred million people rather if there's two million Spearfish are people that doesn't make sense that's ridiculous that's I mean even if it was one half of a percent that's crazy so you're telling me if you get a room with two hundred people one of them's gonna be a spearfisherman get the photo I'm sorry this article I just thought the very very top is from 1954 that makes it even worse that's hilarious you talk about pulling it you know people yeah bro that articles from 2016 wow you should know if you want to want to take up spearfishing Wow by the know-it-all wow that's crazy 19:54 again okay just give a shot whatever I mean it's a great sport it's the best way it's the best way to eat fish and seafood oh I can only imagine if I love fishing I love fishing it's really fun it can be a little stressful sometimes I get that but it's imagine if you you floating you're floating in a saltwater tank and then you're looking around and you're trying to meditate as much as you can and then you're waiting you're in a hunting mode you're focusing and you pray to try to get it and then you have like five grizzly bears that are so cloning you trying to eat your ass does that happen to eat a fish not you do you ever do get approached by sharks and the Bahamas yeah and the Bahamas they're pretty much always there there's a guy who just got bit in Texas he got bit by a bull shark and now he has flesh-eating bacteria that's destroying his leg apparently there's flesh-eating bacteria in the water we don't need to Google that it's pretty that's a bad pretty disgusting I got pretty bad encounters with choice yeah what happened my worst one was in Tampa actually something super easy it was in 15 feet of water and that's actually the dangerous pit fishing is when you strike any cocky and you say like oh what a shallow it's fine we don't have to watch each other everybody's doing their own thing which is really bad definitely never do this huh yeah I got my lesson big time and I was I shot a little fish so I clip it to the back of my gun and then this tiger shark come in and I'm like ooh thank you sorry a little bit they can be very aggressive yeah they're not a nicest one you want to I show up and then he was a junior but juvenile one it was still a good like 7 feet long 7 year about 7 feet long but it was young and the young didn't read the one that he don't trust the big old sharks you know they're wiser they know they check you out and things like that but the young ones that went a little bit crazy so they're gonna go more towards you and they're gonna go try to do like curious bites which is Moton what what happens most of the time which try bites as a curious bite and so the shark is in front of me and he's charging me what his mouth open so with my gun I'm poking it I'm poking like the eyes I'm poking the gills I'm poking the nose I'm trying to poke everything is gonna hurt him as much as I can and not very strong especially in the water so I'm really trying to like bang this freaking gun as much as hard as I could in his face and he doesn't back down he keeps like Strickling and it keeps coming in for me well and at some point I'm like okay like something and I'm gonna have a shoot it hoping that's that you know I'm not gonna miss if I miss then it's the only thing between me and a shark so you're poking it with the tip yeah I'm just playin with the tip and then you roll his eyes back Oh which is when they bite they ready they're ready to bite and I'm like oh shit I'm like am I I'm dying and I'm like okay well whatever you know something like I'm like okay I'm gonna try to aim and try to see if I can shoot it and then my friend arrived he's like oh I heard you screaming what's up he have a fish I'm like uh there's a tiger shy behind you buddy and he's like oh crap he was like if my friend Felix in Montreal was like a 17 year old at the time and you've never rarely spear fish it was first time you're seeing a shark I promised his parents I would bring him back in one piece and Wiser's I'm like okay I'm like don't panic everything is fine how deep blue water like 15 feet of water is so shallow so like put you back against mine and then cover your half and if he comes to Cole just poke it and the SH Y came in a couple of times and then because we were two it was like whatever and he just left he didn't like that that he was outnumbered and I'm like wow so when I was alone with the shark it was screaming in the water and I was like calling my friends for help and then nobody could hear me and then we went back to the blood do you scream underwater how far away can people hear you not not too not too far ten feet 15 feet so I depends on the wave again and the winds and everything like that but nobody could definitely hear me then I wouldn't get get back on the boat my friend I see my friend swimming towards the boat and he screams tiger shark I'm like no shit I feel like screaming for your help but if I was half an hour and then you get to the boat and we left and the striper like circling it was like I was really scary but in that situation again if I had shut the shark to save myself it's I would have got the worst publicity ever it's it's I just when did that happen where sharks became something that are protected in the public eye because was it the governor of New York that killed that shark when he was fishing somewhat was the governor the mayor one of those guys was was sport fishing caught a shark and who was it the Governor Cuomo very common in the States shark fishing well they're edible I've had mako shark and restaurants before you know but something happened something changed and I think it was when there was all this awareness about shark fin soup yeah there it is Andrew Cuomo he caught 154 pounds rushar shark and everybody freaked the fuck out that's when they realized that the Asians we're catching millions a day to me yeah so it became instead of it being something that was just another fish then it became something that's protected and people with a very shallow understanding of what a shark is we're freaking out about it yeah exactly the Asians everybody else be careful today especially with crazy rich Asians number one of the box office I mean it's that that practice of chopping off the fins and throwing the sharks back is horrific but there's their sustainable populations of some sharks I mean apparently off of the coast of California near Catalina Island that the Channel Islands a lot of mako sharks out there and and great whites actually do populations of sharks right now and California is very height of great whites yeah because the seal population became really high and then because you know that the great white shark population takes more time to grow now we're at a stage where there's a shit tons of lionfish and now there's a lot of great whites do mm-hmm but great whites are protected right yes tiger sharks protected Chai's are protected in a lot of places in Florida I don't think you're allowed to eat depends where some marinas are very funny about it and New York I went spitting in New York about a couple of months ago and a guy was like cutting a mako and a dog and nobody was seem to be offended by it well people that are on the water and people that are Fisher people they wouldn't be offended it's it's the casual person on the outside that gets offended exactly but again you know that's what's that's what D that's the double edge of sort of of the internet you know it gave a voice to everybody exactly but it's just like you know they remember that gorila thing yeah people like oh this is terrible they should have never shut the gorillas they should have showed the mother instead I'm like wow we're saying when a surfer gets bitten by a shark they're like artists Paul was in his territory like you shouldn't have like done anything today sure I can like but your mother and that cage were that gorilla then tell me which one you're gonna shoot my money is not in the fridge my money's on of your mother's probably gonna be in the gorillas yeah I wish there was another way I mean I don't know that they needed to shoot that gorilla I don't know enough about gorilla behavior I would like to think that the gorillas wouldn't have done anything to the baby but I don't know anything I don't know much about it's sad but if I have to choose a baby over gorilla I'm taking the baby every time I'm gonna save the baby it's a fucking human it's yeah but it's easy to be irrational when it comes to that but this is it's not you and it you don't have any stake in the game exactly about it from the sidelines and that's people talking about sharks that's people talking about bears as people talking about a lot of animals yeah pretty much and this is why spearfishing hunting or is this very well hated I guess around the world I have friends that run a bear hunting operation in Alberta shoutout to John and Jen saw them this weekend in Calgary they they run a bear hunting operation and they hunt run a hunting operation but they spend a good amount of time bear hunting black bears and the black bear population up there is incredibly dense there's so many of them they're everywhere and they decimate the deer population they decimate the moose the elk they eat all the babies and they cannibalize each other I mean it's a it's a there are beautiful animals they're fascinating they're interesting I'm glad they're around but their populations need to be controlled there's a lot of them and they're delicious and the all these things are like they fly in the face of reason for most people they think if you're shooting a bear that you're a trophy hunter like someone is shooting a rhino or something like that someone who's a terrible person wants to shoot something that's endangered there's they are as far from endangered as is humanly possible they're not endangered by any stretch of the imagination they live in dense forests and there's a giant number of them and you can shoot two of them up there they encourage you to shoot two of them they're trying to thin out the population because of the effect they have on the undulates up there but it's one of those animal that my friend Steve Rinella calls them charismatic megafauna it's cute yeah well it's it's just we've made them into movie characters and TV show characters and people have this idea of what they are based on just this this sort of image that gets portrayed in the public and we accept this narrative and I think that's happening right now with sharks you know no one wants sharks to go extinct I think sharks are awesome they're cool but they're also edible like and if there's a lot of them I'd I've seen people catch mako sharks off of the coast of California and and cut them up and make shark steaks up and eat them and it used to be normal no one cared until I feel like within the last decade something happened in the last decade that people became incredibly outraged when someone kills a shark I actually think that people became outraged when you kill anything but they're so hypocritical because they're killing things left and right with their pocketbook they just don't know it they're killing things their credit card they're killing things with cash if you buy fish in the store you're killing fish I don't care if you like to think you're not you are you're supporting the fish industry you're supporting the killing of these animals you're eating them it's a direct connection you're paying a supermarket hitman to go out and do the work for you want a hundred percent if you eat fish we cannot be against pivoting if you eat meat you cannot be against hunting but it's also the weirdness of it though I went to Whole Foods today I'm before I came here to get some lunch and as I'm walking through just because I was thinking that I was gonna have this conversation with you today and I'm walking by these long aisles of ice with these fish on it and I could just point to one of those fish and go hey give me that thing no connection whatsoever to where that thing came from how it got there I just take it and I could bring it here I probably should have just for effect imagine the amount of grocery stores as a country right a fish display which is completely full well let's just imagine in this area there's a Whole Foods that's about two miles up this way and then if we go down the street there's another one there's outs they have a fish section then we go a little bit further down there's a Gelson's they have a big fish section there's just fish all over the place but the oceans pretty fucking far from here I mean you have to drive to get to the ocean you know and they're not going to the ocean and pulling these fish out themselves they it's all coming from a giant commercial boat that distributes it all throughout Southern California all throughout Northern California all throughout then you get into the middle of the country that's where it gets really crazy if you're buying halibut and you're in South Dakota where the fuck is that coming from you know yeah you're not supposed to eat halibut if you live there I'm just kidding you gotta eat but it's we're weird people are weird I love those boats you know they have I mean the States is actually doing a way better job than a lot of countries I must admit under control of Fisheries but when when I see laws and regulations on small little individual anglers or spear fisherman yeah and then I see a trawler that can catch everything he wants - just it's just for my blood to a next level well it's insane and in our lifetime the population has decreased radically and there's no better example in that than the Tokyo fish markets you know the Tokyo fish markets you interview those guys and they talk about what it used to be like when they just the amount of tuna that these deal with and the amount they deal with now it's a significant dip and this is within you know 40 years like what is it going to be like 40 years from now and the estimates are that it's going to be a radical decrease in the population of almost all fish yeah for sure it's that's the problem people want to have access to everything now if we would put regulations and everybody's fish is like okay look everybody I know you want your salmon but it's gonna be close so January to May I know you want your halibut but you can't eat it this year really next year if we would be willing to live with just I mean I think people would survive it that's for sure I don't think people would get used to pretty much anything but then industry words is worth so much money that they are not willing to do them it's not just the industry is worth so much money is there there's certain people in certain countries in particular where that is all they have I mean there's certain people out there where they they're dependent upon the ocean and it's bounty for their survival and if they can't sell fish and they can't buy fish and we're talking about individual fish or people that have boats and you know are doing it on their own small-scale commercial fishermen there's not a lot of room for error there they're not making a ton of money those are in the problem don't like the small family commercial fishing boat they're not the problem I mean it's when you see when you see those guys bring it you know like the guy in the video earlier yeah he was catching a big net he's catching like quite a bit of fish but the reality of things are ships foreign ships raiding the entire ocean with with nets are like kilometers long yeah like am i filleted and that is an a mile long yeah and you just catch everything you can in it turtles sharks everything you know and then it's not it's not they're freaking Johnson finally that lives in North Carolina are you catching lobster and and then then to know that I'm making a problem you'd have to have some regulations that were accepted by all these different countries too and that would be a real difficult thing to pull off to get these countries to accept that they're gonna lose money and to do it in a timely fashion where these these fish could actually bounce back it's not gonna happen and so there's nothing left that's crazy and it's everybody sees it everybody is talking about it but when you look at the sheer size of the ocean the idea that we could fish the ocean out it's so crazy that's a lot of fish but when you see those commercial boats and how the quantity of fish they manage to take out of the ocean it's a lot of fish is there any talk about doing something about this is there anything on the table is there any discussion about regulating the amount of fish these gigantic boats can pull out well again a u.s. is trying to to regulate that and they actually made efforts that proved to increase the the amount of fish or it's good they're actually working in the right direction but the problem is that still to this day I'm not sure exactly how much how many nautical mile you have to be but a Russian or Chinese foreigner trawler is allowed to fish from the coast of the United States and international water to just rate everything and there's nothing he can do about it who's gonna regulate this right UN China is gonna be like yeah sure buddy yeah I mean look Japan still killing whales you know they kill whales under the guise of science have you seen how they do that the Sea Shepherd's those guys yeah and then they kill him sell them I mean it's really fucked up you know there was this the same exact problem was going on in the United States in the 1800s market hunting is what they were calling it where they devastated all the wildlife in North America the Buffalo population was almost brought to extinction levels really close there's still some wild herds that exist in Mexico and there were some of them that exist the United States and now they brought them back but to this day the majority of Buffalo that live in North America are all on private land the majority of them but at one point in time there's millions and millions of them all throughout the country elk there they've only been repopulated to a small percentage of their original range I think it's something like 30 percent there's some animals that have thrived like white-tailed deer because they live primarily in farmlands and farmlands have gotten so huge that they they were essentially like farm animals now it's very strange like when you think of white-tailed deer the places where they're the most popular that's like CENTAC law student no that's actually Ranger that's a caribou yeah caribou are these migrating deer that live in Canada primarily and in Alaska and they migrate for hundreds and hundreds of miles and these massive herds they're very different and you know unlike deer you'll see them like hundreds of them moving together in in one group in one line across the tundra but these animals that were in North America not Alaska but North no not the the lower 48 they were wiped out almost to nothing antelope deer elk Buffalo they were almost all wiped out by market hunting because this is back when we didn't have refrigerators so people would shoot these things and bring them to market and people would go to market and buy that meat and they would bring it in on trucks I mean I guess they just have blocks of ice and these trains and trucks and they would bring in this meat and they killed almost everything and it's short amount of time like less than a hundred years there was almost nothing left and then they instituted these laws where it was illegal to sell wild game so if you buy elk like say in this country if you buy elk meat you're buying it from New Zealand you're getting it it's actually enforced right now still yeah yeah there's there are some commercial farms I don't know what they sell I mean I think you can sell commercially raised deer and elk in America but if you go to a restaurant most of what you're getting you're actually getting from New Zealand yeah but you can't go to the woods like say if you went to the woods and you went and shot an elk like that one up there and you try to sell it's illegal to sell you can't sell that meat it's not a marketable product it's something that has to you have to have a tag for it you have to pay for the tag and then it has to be for your own personal consumption or you can give it away to your friends but you can't sell it okay it's the only way they had eliminate market hunting was the only way to bring these populations back and then they had a enforce these very strict conservation efforts and then here's the big one is I think it's called the pikmin Robertson app whatever the pikmin Robertson is that it is that's the name of it it what it is is it takes 10% of all of the proceeds from hunting supplies and gear and puts it to wildlife conservation which is an enormous amount of money billions and billions of dollars so it goes to preserve habitat and wetlands goes to reintroduce species into places where they been decimated like elk are now enviable numbers in places where they were completely extinct like in Virginia and and I think Tennessee has them now swell Kentucky I know has them Pennsylvania Haslam and at one point in time there was none they're like up until you know just a few decades ago if it's if things are actually handle in a responsible and smart way we can there is a way to save everything but this is the unites the promises the United States like the United States is like it's it's on land it's controllable you know it's our it's it's within these the boundaries of this this one country you know the control is accepted when you're talking about the ocean it'll be really difficult to get other countries to agree to that kind of strict management that brought back wildlife in North America to do that to the ocean but if they did do that to the ocean mean maybe everything could bounce back a few states Florida is definitely one of them where they're looking very closely to what's going on and then they have close seasons and things like that and actually makes it really nice and big difference but again I think the problem is not coming from that a problem is coming from again like deep trawling and you know commercial foreign commercial fishing it's a big industry it is Florida for sport fishing is a giant industry people go there every year to grouper fish and fish for tarpon and you know there's there's a lot of fishing in Florida and it's probably a pretty significant part of their economy yeah I think I read somewhere that them actually the number the number of jobs in a reckoner of recreational fishing was higher than in commercial fishing in the States Wow I believe I read that the number of jobs so so the number of boys right so like selling fish and rods and lures and guiding people and that kind of makes sense so the commercial also I mean the biggest problem with commercial fishing is I went to actually went to Taiwan last here and I was helping them finding government and giving them a proposal on how they can change the law to make the fisheries better and they were explain it to me in Italy they have those ships and they hired people from the Philippines or from Indonesia and then they put them in a ship for six months they take your passport and they're getting paid like nothing literally nothing and all they do all day long is they can stew you know it gets you know they gets you in any case you know for like 14 hours a day and that's it and they'll bring a tuna backs in a salad you know the problem is people are fucking up so many different parts of the world so fast it's hard to like well we got to really put it all aside and concentrate on the fish now for sure it's no that's again it's a lot of money and there's a lot of people depending on it but then at some point we're going out to realize hey there's no fish so it's were more people so we're gonna have to turn herself on on them and then but people are not gonna change their ways would do anything unless he being told sorry there's no more fish how long have you been doing this now full-time yeah about three years and have you noticed a difference in three years depends where but yeah some places definitely there's some when I've been traveling in some places what I've been and a third time that I would a third time before time I was coming back I could see it was even less and less fish they really didn't meet the Turanian is a disaster Mediterranean there's literally nothing left in that place what would happen and it's again that's another example where this has been over fish for so many years they don't allow spear fishing there but a commercial fishing boat is allowed to catch as many tuna as they want for Trina I mean this provision easily yeah Anthony Bourdain did something in Italy and they they were so little fish that they were actually throwing frozen fish into the water like frozen octopus into the water and they wanted him to pretend to catch these frozen octopus instead he made a mockery of it and like showed the guy throwing the frozen fish into the water frozen octopus into the water I'm not surprised if you catch a fish in Greece can sell it for like 100 euros because there's no fish there's no fish there's definitely no fish but really people won't you enjoy waves until you tell them sorry you can't have you candy anymore didn't gonna be like I guess I have to make an effort now fuck so what would be the solution I mean can they is there a way to commercially raise fish that's viable it's like they do with the cattle industry well I'm actually going to the Marshall Islands in October and I'm going to visit this um the Marshall Island Marshall Islands were those that's a middle of Pacific a near Hawaii no it's near Australia oh wow something like that I know it's new Papua New Guinea very careful they eat people over there oh that's mine I don't have much meat unlike the appetizer but they have so I'm going to visit a farm that is sustainable and everything so there's any New Guinea people listening that I'm joking around people get so outraged this motherfuckers calling us all cannibals is that where it is show me where it is again right there where your where your arrow is oh my god that is ridiculous don't go there so they told me didn't happen so one day Nabel farm so I'm going to visit it I'm gonna see is you just have to be really care for because again if de leaks into the ocean and then it contaminates out of fish and then if some of them escaped creates problems so it's what kind of problems does it create um you can have a captive one so basically is gonna infect the other fish in fact them with diseases yeah what diseases diseases they get when they're in captivity taking it so it's a lot like captive animals like avian flu and swine yeah pretty much but in them fucking great some really bad there were some stories about some really bad fish farms that are feeding them with pigs stuff and like it's just again it's all about being being responsible we did a podcast recently about CWD CD wasting disease as a disease that's spreading amongst deer in this country and they think a lot of it is coming or some of it at least is coming from deer farms they have these deer farms and all these animals are getting off the same food than they scape and then they spread it and then there's an incubation period and I mean it exists in the wild and it exists in deer farms so it's like it's very complicated but so they have a similar issue with fish then yeah they do actually and it's pretty bad but it's what kind of diseases do they get it's just I'm gonna be familiar with fish diseases to be honest but is that term it's definitely like some fish have cancer it's bad is what is the term zoonotic is that the term when it leaves and makes the jump to humans the diseases are there any yeah that's what like avian flu is and swine flu okay it's a disease that makes it jump to humans is there any diseases in fish that make the jump to humans apart from parasites the only thing you can take off that you mean can actually get and parasites are pretty rare with ocean fish right it's more common with freshwater fish these worms we can see warm sometimes but you just discard them and then this one didn't gonna kill you they're just gonna take a little funky yeah you've eaten worms that came out of fish for sure right uh most probably I just probably don't know it when I cut the fish raw cut it pretty small so I make sure it is nothing so you look to see the worms yeah you can see them how much worm can you get in your body to where it starts growing take a little slice I'm not gonna try do you know that no when you cook the fish they all dead so that's you if you freeze it that's what a lot of people freeze their sushi before eating it yeah they try to do that with pigs and a lot of animals in this country too but there's two types of trichinosis apparently maybe there's more but there's two very specific kinds of trichinosis one that if you freeze it'll die and this is trichinosis that comes from an animal that's from the southwest of the United States okay but then there's trichinosis that comes from animals that's in the northern territories and Canada in particular like it bears Alaska and that stuff you could freeze it it doesn't matter it doesn't even kill it when you freeze it yeah so you have to cook it it has to be cooked to hunt I think it's 160 degrees some 147 162 recommended temperature you have to kill those little fuckers yeah otherwise you just it just gets in your muscle tissue have some friends that caught it's horrific oh that's bad yeah you like your whole body's like in pain because it's literally they're burrowing their way into your body I don't think you have something dad bad and fish I mean maybe that's why I'm skinny who knows it's probably pretty lean stuff yeah but also freediving you burn when he goes fishing you burn about between a thousand and I think 1,300 calories an hour what so if you wouldn't lose weight losing really yeah 1,300 calories an hour that's incredible it's it's very very intense wow that's amazing that's what you would think a lot of people listen to this like I could eat so much food I'll just go freediving but you also don't eat food which is what's that Jim the Marshall Islands oh Jesus blow that thing up we've we've shown that a million times that's the crazy nuclear bomb testing area that is the nuttiest shit ever you see that is miles high water spraying up into the sky so maybe the fish are gonna have like three eyes oh yeah you're gonna have fish they can read your mind figured I know you're coming what are you spearfishing for in the Marshall Islands I'm not gonna be finishing who's gonna be visiting yeah so it's kind of good I have a lot of people asking me for alternatives and what he can do you wanna get meat and so this is one of the possible alternatives of these farms exactly so I'm gonna check it out and make sure that it's it's legit and then is it possible that they could reintroduce fish into the ocean like stock the ocean because that's what they do some Lakes like I used to go fishing at this lake in Boston and they restock it every year with rainbow trout yeah that's actually my my lake when my parents have a good country how's it do that too and it works the only problem I would see with that for like an ocean fish would be I'm thinking because they never had predators in captivity that that maybe in might have a survival after that but maybe they can learn it I don't know yeah the strong and smart survive I mean you still better that if you know if there's if they put ten thousands if two thousand survive it still gets better yeah yeah I wonder what do would have to do I want to if it's it's even possible to restock something as big as the ocean it's just being fished so quickly and that's that's that's the biggest problem but there are solutions it's just people have to be willing to talk about it and right now that's the biggest problem with the same situation as with the Wall Street Journal when people and trying to talk about food sourcing and mentioning alternatives like we don't fish we don't see food no that's not true and don't you think that it's the optics though I mean what they they're concerned with is not it's not that it's rational it's that they don't want any controversy that's what it is so a person like you although what you're doing is if you explain it and you look at it objectively it's very rational but they're not trying to be rational what they're trying to do is avoid any conflict like there was a guy who is a NASCAR driver okay and he lost a sponsor recently for some racist stuff that his father said thirty years ago this is how crazy people are getting thirty years ago his father used a racial slur and because of that this guy who wasn't even alive when this happened or maybe he was alive maybe he was seven years old or some shit he lost a sponsor I mean it's one of the companies are such cowards like they're so terrified because of social media because people are so willing to protest and there's a bunch of fuckheads out there that just get a thrill off of getting people fired and of getting things canceled and of like exercising action and seeing a result all they're doing is pushing buttons it's not that they've thought about this and like hey is this guy really responsible should we really blame him for something his father did thirty years ago that's ridiculous what we should do is nothing just let it go I mean unless this guy is like some sort of white supremacist or some racist himself yeah and he's not we should just do nothing but that's not that doesn't that's not fun what's fun is getting a rush a power trip out of action like clearly there should like if you find a real racist something someone who's doing something actively to harm other people simply based on their ethnic origin or the color of their skin yeah that's terrible you should talk out about that that should be eliminated from our society real real racism but that's not what this is what this is is people deciding that they're they're going to take action and then NASCAR being a pussy about it or this company being a pussy about it and that's the same thing that's happening with you it's not this is not a rational decision like they should look at it and go wow what an interesting way to get your fish like how many these people that made this decision actually eat fish I'll bet it's most I bet it's most people should understand also that by refraining people to talk about it you're being part of the problem yes this is why things have been so bad for so many years because nobody wants to talk about it they all want to eat it they just don't want to know where it's from but no one's looking at things long-term all they're looking at isn't potential short-term income loss so with the Wall Street Journal or the Washington Post or whatever whatever paper it is what they're worried about they're worried that someone's going to come along and say the Wall Street Journal support was a Wall Street Journal yeah The Wall Street Journal supports a mass extinction of fish they just reframe it in some outrageous unrealistic non accurate way what people need to chill out you I think like I understand I understand when it come from and the sense that especially like the Millennials or whatever we're all born when you know we had a bunch of toys with China and would shit about that we ate whatever we want nobody shit about that we had frickin processed food nobody cared about it we had hot dogs and nobody was saying anything about it and then we all reached like 20s and I'll suddenly being told but everybody oh by the way you know everything like all you Barbies were there very bad for environment oh you know what by the way like the hotdogs you've been eating they're very bad for the environment and you're like we live in an era when being told that everything we're doing is wrong and it's hard it's hard for somebody that lives in middle city that doesn't know anything else she'd be like oh yeah you know what's a shoe I'm gonna just stop eating this that I've been eating for the last 20 years just because somebody told me so somebody had a very funny tweet about Starbucks about I was you know they do you know California eliminated straws yeah in Starbucks had this whole thing about you know how big signed about our you know we're doing our part for the environment we're eliminating straws and and then on the you know on the tweet it said okay so you're just putting plastic lids on your coffee cups yeah and what happens with them and then Starbucks it said oh shit just get really straws you got plastic lids everywhere you go those goddamn Starbucks lids are littered on the street they're everywhere but this is actually this is a perfect example because it shows exactly this is just a little bit of action they people are like they have either a very small action and makes them feel better right or they like to point out the fingers of somebody yes you with your straw exactly you have a straw now it's it's just the way people are dealing with that they've being told that everything they've been doing since Jake kids are bad so now they're like no but but but look at her she's pier fishing she's evil like what it's just it's just I think it's that I think it's the way that people are handling the fact that they've being told everything is wrong that they're trying to be like no I made my effort I mean a Facebook post this morning saying that I wasn't getting straw so I'm Green California seeks to be the first state to limit plastic straws all restaurants Wow yeah is that that's not as a pass but that's that's been proposed Governor Jerry Brown I just happen how can it be so difficult she'd be like look plastic is a problem yeah you use something else you know one thing that they I don't know work maybe I saw this for European that's fun this on your page that there's a new invention that they use for water runoff before it goes into the ocean is this giant net that catches all this plastic particles was that on your install page no that it's really interesting someone has invented this cover that's like it's it's like a filter that as the waters going through it catches all the stuff that would ordinarily be washed out to sea and so it basically over these storm drainage pipes these enormous pipes is this huge net so the water can still go through it but just shows you like this insane amount of debris and and garbage that would have ordinarily just been washed out to sea kind of catching it in these nets it's not everything but it's a start yeah it's not gonna make up for the fucking cruise ship that's dumping things just right offshore it's crazy I did not know that that was the case yeah you you it's it's legal to and that's the worst part of it but but you can't spit fish because I'm the bad guy so what you want to do is you want a spear fish and you want to raise awareness that you want to continue to live this life so what you're trying to do along the way is trying to figure out how to make a living while you're doing it I do I'm I'm gonna want to write a book at some point and I want to ask you how old you're I'm 31 so this is an age where people are like oh Jesus you're in your 30s should have your shit together by now that's a lot of people think you know like it's you're in that area where like you should you should have your career in order you should think about settling down having a family you should start your 401k and you should have all this stuff in line and you're out there fishing stabbing fish no I don't I don't mind dad I don't think my age is an issue it's I don't think it's an issue either I'm just saying that in the path from graduating high school to going to college to becoming a person that's 31 years old I mean a lot of people compare themselves in a very is a sort of foolish way they compare themselves with other people like how much stuff have these people accumulated how much why but it was for me was it was a crucial step of my life to be able to take a step back I want to take a step back of all of that and be like okay whoa like I've been telling the same thing since I'm born about what I should want about what I should do about you know about what we didn't mean exactly you know it's like when I was when it was seven years old I look at my mom and I said you know mom when I grow up I rather have like a job that I don't like when I make a shit ton of money and then a job I love what I make nothing I was seven until that to my mother and my mom was like what did I do wrong here well that's a rational thought with kids and then when I quit my job then my mom is doing one being like why are you doing that you have no security of life and I'm like well sorry it's it's it's good I need I need a step back I need to look at everything around me I need to look at society you need to look how things work and I want to make sure that when I'm when I'm in it it's because I actually I know what I want yeah and I like being told to do right so that's that's kind of what I'm doing and figuring out my own thing and the figure out what's what's important for me and what my real values are and don't think you can discover the person you really are by staying in your nine-to-five by not knowing anything and being unhappy and not being able to go outside of your comfort zone Brian comfort zone it's the big word right because it's comforting that you get that check every week it is but ultimately it's it's numbing you have kids you have this and that but it's it's people that tell me like ah are you Sakura just I've done that or oh you invu life so much I'm like well when I first quit my job I live in my freaking car for a while because I didn't have a place to stay and either no money to sustain myself did you really leave a new car yeah I did for a while how long like about like a bun something like that would anyone like spec know or did you shower somewhere no no I have friends so I was like showering there's also beaches the showers in the beach that I always do when that was happening how old were you 20 was three years ago so 20 so you're 28 and you're like what you like what the fuck am i doing my life I'm living in my car yeah but I had a lawyer yeah but I felt I felt free and I never regretted in my life and that's well you are courageous if that's the case because a lot of people would panic me included it's I guess you courageous in a way regarding like the fact that you sleeping in a car yeah but if he unhappy with your life why why keep going with it well that's what you're saying is logical right but logic is not how most people live their lives what you're saying is like you're it's romantic like you're saying I want to live my life with passion and I want to follow my interests and I don't mind living in my car and showering at the beach I don't mind I'm fine with that most people are not fine with that most people would be insecure and they would be scared of the future and they would want some sort of stability and that's that's what's courageous about your your decision because one of the things that like I was talking with people about you before I did this podcast and the question from everybody is like how does she make a living I'm like oh no I'm not sure I'm like she I guess she's this professional spear Fisher person I go but I don't know how you make money doing that I'm like maybe your guide people take people out sometimes very rarely I'm afraid having a structure too so I don't only give private lessons I'm a free diving instructor and so I don't really I give lessons once in a while I have contracts here in there I'm not right now I reached a point where I'm not I'm not rich but I'm at start being either right and I'm kind of I'm happy about it and I'm actually do believe I was gonna lead to some something but lead to something that to a job that I think is gonna be you know I'm starting conferences around and I think that's that's something that really really interests me conferences like like this women's empowerment thing you were gonna talk yeah pretty much I'll do well well that was just one and I'm sure look people love a story about someone who's following their passion because there's so many well out there that really desperately want to do that they just don't know how to do it or how to get the courage to do it or they get stuck with a mortgage or maybe they have a family and responsibilities or maybe they have loved ones that are taken care of and they can't and so when they hear about someone who's going for it either they're jealous of you and they hate on it and they say that stupid that girl's a fool above all or they go god I wish I could do that those those are the two depending upon the mindset of the person that's watching you that's going to be the reaction well I have I have a TV show coming on her my cookbook coming on what's the TV show I have it's a TV it's gonna be in French but it's it's about I'm gonna be traveling around the world and fishing would talk about that it's a TV show it's gonna be fun and I'm starting with my sister just graduated from fashion design in London and we're just starting a bathing-suit company with recycled fabric oh okay so we're doing I have a few things in my pipeline I'm not I don't like being bored I don't like I know it seems like it like Oh like I'm free-spirited and I travel around but I'm I'm still a very ambitious person and I do want to achieve things I'm gonna make me proud it's not always you know it's not I didn't quit everything to to become a hippie and live on the beach and wear no shoes rest of my life no I just I quit my job to live and build my life in my career the way I wanted to and in a way I was making me proud and happy so this is pretty much what I'm what I'm what I'm doing right now it's very admirable it really is it's an it it is really brave because there's you're not gonna get a whole lot of reinforcement from other people I'm sure you probably didn't probably wearing a lot of people that were telling you you go for a girl go sleep at the beach yeah stay in your car yeah you don't have a shower who needs a shower you don't care but there's also a group of people were like oh yes it's a good idea and then a second you turn around they're like am I getting so stupid well people love to talk shit but it's even in my hardest moments when I was broke or anything like that I never regretted it not one second I told myself I made a wrong decision if I get a good sign well the good thing is you were doing something that's so soul-sucking anything seems like it's it's it's worth it I really found myself in situations when I was like ooh I'm actually an asshole I was like okay I'm gonna have to work on debt as a lawyer no even like in this life you know especially when when you know filming a documentary in Africa or in different places well you know you have no food and you're like I have a table of people know we're sharing like a cantina between four people and you're like like yeah let's share I'm happy to share and it's just like I just want to like push it around and it's you you discovering yourself sometimes you don't always like what you see and it's but it's it's good it's it's what it's for you know it's you look at yourself and then I would never discover the type of person I am when I'm starving run a nine-to-five job unless you're starving right exactly how many people ever are right not definitely not that many and again this was the thing that shot me the most and I think it's also what touches people the most about Africa has been one of them is people the super close with each other people are really nice and you're really focusing on the nice things and it's you like wow I won that I want to keep doing that but then you know you spend your money there and then you spend a month in New York City and you forget everything yeah it takes literally a week to forget everything you know another hard thing would be if you tried to relay your experiences on a television show it would be edited down to even if it's an one hour show they with commercials it becomes 44 minutes and you're just not going to be able to get all that and they know very hard I told him that I was not interested into doing anything scripted and I told them if I want to do a TV show if I'm puking I want it there if I'm crying I wanted there if I hate it if I'm crying for my mummy to come pick me up I wanted there too because I think it's it's that's what's that's was that's the beauty part about those travels and that's what needs to be shown I think that would be a real reality show but the reality of reality shows is most of them are at least planned out if they're not scripted totally and you can tell you know you can tell when people like well we got to fix this gas pump we're not gonna get this boat started you know bad actors you see to their face you could smell it when they're acting just like that's what it was the beauty of the Antony Brunei show actually it was all about but he wouldn't do that I mean that's why we through the frozen octopus in the water he was mocking them exactly but it yeah I mean I understand why a lot of people see that in me I'm a girl and sometimes a little bit girly and things like that and people are like like oh she wants us to be in a TV show and do this and do that and it's it's III get why why people would think that but it's it's I mean if you pass five minutes with me you're gonna realize I also think what you're trying to do is relay your passion for something and when people really like I've struggled with that with bowhunting because I've done some things on camera I did some film last year for Under Armour we went elk hunting but part of me is like everything should just be broadcast not everything should be filmed sometimes life should just be experienced especially for someone like me who's I think I'm overexposed in the first place I would be better off doing less things publicly so that's one that I've decided to do less of publicly but part of me wants people to know that there's a satisfaction to like bow hunting in particular is very very difficult it's very hard to do it takes intense practice it takes a lot of physical exercise you have to be able to run up the hills you have to have endurance because you're climbing through the mountains all the time and then it's hard to do it's hard to find the animals it's hard to get close enough to shoot one you have to be able to execute when the moment is there it's very difficult to shoot an animal with a bow and arrow especially the long distance I mean you have to have an extreme amount of proficiency before you can ever pull that off in there high-stress situations so part of me wants to relay that there's a misconception about what people see when they think of hunting they think of cruelty and they think of someone who doesn't respect nature and they think of they think of this they think of this abusive relationship that humans have with animals instead of the way I look at it which is you have this deep understanding of the food chain and this food chain exists whether you're there or not cuz food chain exists with bears and wolves and mountain lions and deer and elk and all these animals are struggling for survival and all you do is interject you step in for a little bit and you take your part in the food chain and in in in turn you also give out all this money that goes to conservation it's money that goes to conservation ensures that this opportunity be there for other hunters in the future and ensures that the populations these animals will stay healthy and it ensures that they'll be monitored by the proper Fish and Game and wildlife biologists and all these different people that are going to ensure that these animals are this this environment and this experience is preserved and the the wild habitats that these animals enjoy will be preserved and for people it's it's it's very conflicting you know for people it's it's it seems almost hypocritical that you could say that you love these animals but you also want to eat them yeah but that's that's know what's what's what's what's the hyperacute thing to do is to say that you love them and then buy time for grocery store not caring how they cut their yeah that's when you being ridiculous what's the problem is that's been available for so long we're used to it like if there was just a machine that you could go to where you could just get your money from machine you talk to somebody about hunting and then they put their finger in ears and they're like oh I don't want to hear anything in your life what what the same McDonald's The Wall Street Journal approached you went with fishing spearfishing it's the same thing it's not it's not a well thought out rational argument they're worried about outrage and in this day and age it's very easy like I had a picture I put up the other day of a target that I have in my backyard with some arrows in it and all these vegans are attacking me for shooting fucking target you know that's crazy I mean they know I'm practicing them get ready shoot animals but all they're doing is there's no animal there it's fucking elk and they're getting angry because that's what people like to do they like to express outrage and they they talk too much there's too much expression take it from someone who does talk too much me I talk way too much but people there they're not considering their what they're doing they're just doing it and you're not you don't change people's opinion by being an asshole online you just get everyone to realize you're an asshole true I got a bunch of vegan following me now because I took the time to respond to eight concerns and now they actually got it but how can we make improvements when when you have in one side angry bunch of people that all they want to do is scream scandal or everything they see and then you decide the people that matters that have a strong voice or its care to talk about everything because they're scared of that first group and then by doing that we're doing nothing I've been toning down a lot my Instagram I stopped posting fish with like blood on it or things like that because people just don't want to don't want to see it and I know I don't have a choice to to do that because again what but what percentage don't want to see this is the thing I mean if someone eats fish if they'd like sushi and then they get upset when they go to your Instagram page and you've got a spear through a tuna you're on you're almost you're educating them in a lot of ways and the people that do get upset even though you hear their voices and their voices are it's a loud minority I mean you have how many followers do you have on Instagram eighty-four thousand same thing I think what 84,000 people looks like in a room that's a giant number of people now imagine 50 those people are screaming assholes that's what you have true it's a small percentage the the number of people that see it and they're rational adults they know that in order to kill a tuna there's gonna be some blood there's no bloodless method for killing a tuna doesn't exist I mean but also the weird thing is that in a way I understand the outrage on a certain level like do i when I went deer hunting for the first time in new caledonia and last October and it was not what Bo story was with actually gun and Wonder I shot the deer I saw I crying I was like am I gonna kill Bambi I'm so bad and I get there it was like I was all cute and everything you're like okay and then it was dead and then I carried it on my back and we walked back to the to the house and then they started cutting it in pieces and I started looking like me and my guilt went completely away completely away and I was like wow how much of an hypocrite can I be then I'm crying because I killed freakin Bambi like actual physical tears going up my face and then a second I see a piece of meat I just got excited I'm like you know we're gonna be burgers all of a sudden and it's it's fish is a little bit easier because a lot of us have seen whole fish has kids you know you put a whole fish in a tea bowl so that the Gores a little bit less there so it's more about the blood than seen actual fish dead but I bet I get it how I know it's bad but I I felt really really like in hyper good after that like I know I know that I mean I felt that what I felt in a weird way I felt like a weird sense of loss the first time I shot a deer but it went away when I started eating it too and I never killed an animal before that but I had killed fish I've been fishing since I was a little kid I love fishing but I didn't feel a connection with fish the same way I felt a connection with a mammal it's cuz it's closer to us you know yes it's closer to our species fish is like an alien thing that lives in an alien world that breeze water but again the one that have like the human-like eyes then I tend to feel a tuner is one of them I tend to it's true I have I have a picture I have to show it to you tuna eyes it's you're like its it looks it looks really like you can see expression and their eyes and that's when that's the second way people starting to feel like what fear there's I think it's curiosity but I guess you can say it's just freaking out because it knows you're gonna eat it it's anthropomorphism right we look at animals that's actually very that's kind of human like well that fish is an asshole I can tell in his eyes what is that that's a duck to eat tuna fuck those teeth are amazing yeah that's a pretty weird fish folks so it's you know you can see like it's like a little wig white on the outside and then just color and this is just freaking out because it's looking out at the air for the first time it's like holy shit there's another world up here for a second he was right there he's alive or she's alive yeah it's probably freaking out it's outside the water like what in the fuck is this Oh imagine if it was alive about John my ass my hands would a son of his gills if it comes back alive this is a very very strong fish oh I'd imagine look at it looks like a tank but I mean imagine being a fish you live your whole life in the water and then also and someone pulls you out of it and you look into the air what is this and why can't I breathe well at least I did it very quickly so that's the good thing about it yeah but it's gotta be a freak out and place your brains like the size of your fingernail right but a knife is brain pretty quickly what's that a knife is brain pretty quick how would you do right in the film so you kill them and if you don't you shoot them and if you don't kill them on a shoot them what a gun really yeah you shoot tuna with a gun what a spear gun yeah oh okay spirit oh sorry yes you're gonna lean sideways shoot him right in the head because I know they Club them they Club fish and they put poem on boats but I didn't know they shot him sure you can but you shouldn't mom the water that's that's how you do it what a spear gun you shoot them underwater yes yes I get that what is P and then when you get it on land what I do is well what's more spivey Sherman's do you grab them from the gills that's a little Gore sorry graphic content beware and then you grab me right of gilding you knife it and it nice instantly right if you do if you go lie fishing or even commercial fishing what I do is is throw in a boat and then dice of like 16 hours and yeah so it's much we kill it as quick as possible yeah and do you immediately throw them on ice yes you know what I didn't know until you boy at first you bleed it first you know when you eat when you eat sushi or fish meat tastes fishy mm-hmm it's very often to blot that makes that makes that taste mmm so every time we catch a fish you just cut the gills you let it bleed and then that's the same with meat I just named I mean yeah they with the butcher a deer they'll hang it by its legs and cut its throat and got it and let everything let the meat bleed out and fish you have to do it straight away almost in the water if it is not too many sharks around because the blood coagulates very very very quickly right and then it becomes Julie and then it changes the flavor of the fish yeah because when you fill it it you know you've got me cut it on the side and then anyway you flip it there's just like blood everywhere and then it's painting to me and then it creates a tape so just not take it and I think that's one of the reasons why they soak fish in milk it changes the flavor because I think if I remember this correctly is enzymes in milk that destroy the harmful bacteria that causes fish to taste fishy and I think they said that this works also with meat and with chicken that there's a certain smell to chicken in particular that when you I get it like it's might smell a little monkey what that is is this certain bacteria that's on the surface of the skin and then if you soak it in milk see if you can find that I remember I read that like really recently saying it does it helps odor free cooking when you're doing fish or shark even - I tried yeah that's the only time I use sharks you monster well I was in the in Mongkok in I saw a guy was floating in Montauk yeah and then he was for letting a bit like a small mako shark and I asked him for a piece and he gave me a slug and what stroked me was like a smell it smell like meat you can you can smell like like the ammonia in it was it was super strong and and I read online I said put in Millican lemon juice for 24 hours mmm did you do that yes I did juice would break it down how do you cook it I just fried it in a pan do you have a special way that you like to cook fish um depends which one but I really like lightly floured and just I see within olive oil and then I I cook it slowly and butter a friendship with butter and everything yeah have you become like more into cooking because you you kill your own fish opposite really I actually I mean opposite in a way that I always love to cook and I got into spearfishing because of cooking so this is what made me fall in love with the sport is the fact that other lifestyle you can call it it's the fact that catching my own food I get access to to amazing fish and seafood that is couldn't be more fresh than then there's a guy named Hank Shaw he's been on my podcast before he's an amazing chef and he he has a bunch of wild game recipe books and he got into it because he wanted the freshest ingredients and he wanted wild game ingredients as opposed to buying farm raised or factory farmed food he wanted to be able to cook amazing dishes from like say a wild pig that he shot himself so he got into hunting because of that and because of that it's it's he's very valuable for people that are really interested in cooking wild game because he was a legit excellent chef before he ever got into hunting and then getting into hunting and now he writes books about it and he's very very passionate about it it was it was a very similar situation to me and I literally got into it just pretty much just for the food actually the first two years when I thought is pivoting ain't even like spearfishing I was in the water scared of my own shadow for two years I was the first time I liked it I liked a concept I liked what was behind it I fell in love with with catching my own food and cooking after and all of that just finishing itself it took me a while so you were still nervous about I was extremely nervous extremely nervous like struggling to breathe and every time I was going for finishing trip I couldn't sleep for months I was literally imagining myself being chewed by a shark and this and that and it was it was if never my trips never been about that even though it was completely petrified of them I've been lost at sea once which was pretty shitty day and I got lost at sea yeah what happened two years ago I was in Mexico when I was with friends in Mexico I was I was so angry I hated a guy so badly what happened so I jump in a water it's a friend of mine I've never speakers before and we're in the water and your friend never spirit no no you never do anything he's just like I want to look around and see what are you doing and then I see the hope is the water it's pretty deep well you can't see the bottom and then the bow start going like further and further and further and further and further and my friend is like what's going on I'm like nothing nothing and I'm like okay we're gonna start swimming from the shore right now for the shore yeah for sure so start swimming it was like it would have been doable it was a good like five miles maybe the fucking shore was fine it was name is far it was like I would have done it it was definitely been after Darwin hurry too short so I'm trying not to panic my heart is like pounding in my chicken working my throat it's dripping weight drifting away way for no reason and for my he was in charge of the boat the captain that we hired I was American action what do you do to start drinking and not paying attention to you oh wait and there were stocks I told my friend Achilles when we swam for about an hour an hour and a half and then a boat passes by so I started screaming and yelling and I had my buoy luckily I was swimming it and it passed next to me any wave at me like hi I'm like no no I'm like how how hell I go completely nuts and then a boat stuff and they pick us up and I trying to explain and my completely Nexus in Spanish that we've been drowning at sea and I'm like I'm the boat is like right there super far away and they drop us to the boat the guys asking me for money I'm like I'm lost at sea my wits you think I'm carrying the guy took you to the boat is asking you for money no they gotta pick me up asking me for money for tip for rescuing me in the middle of the ocean I was like sorry I don't have tip in my panties right now but thank you for saving my life and then you drop us to the boat and then we get to the boat and the guys like ah I didn't put enough gas in the boat oops I'm like what so he ran out of gas I guess so you were he would never been able to get you never holy shit it was so bad and we managed to the cold guard came and it tried told to both and he started telling to the coastguard to like go screw himself because because I don't want to pay for this you already bunch of assholes I'm like can you stop talking right now oh my god and you literally insulted him so badly did colgar it left did they take you with them no what about Oh with my friends ever drinking are you so mad and like just just keep drinking so how did you get back and then II managed to find full reception and he called a cousin of his wife as his neighbor of this and dad to come tow him he arrived like about an hour and a half later I got back to shore and the guys like oh so what time we went tomorrow I'm like screw you I'm leaving I'm everywhere sorry I'm going tomorrow what a fucking delusion is so bad died and I left in the ocean and I didn't have any gas I told the Coast Guard to go exactly I'm like you've never seen you ever again and we get to the car and my friend is like oh I give him like a hundred dollars and chip is that enough I'm like you did what and yeah so save is it was yeah is that the scariest thing that's ever happened you in the water besides the tiger shark yeah definitely for sure anything else like that that really freaked me out that should freak you out five miles is a long way to swim especially if you don't swim distance all the time did you have any floatation device or anything I have one buoy about that big and we were two I was more scared because it was about like four thirty five so the Sun was getting down really quickly he wouldn't be able to see what assurance no by me would alight yes but it's more I was more freaked about like fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck so I I had moments in spearfishing that was a little bit freaky I also had a blackout last year so inner water yeah that's the biggest danger of spearfishing it's actually black again it's not sharks it's not getting bitten by undoing yeah so basically what happens is that you dive down and then when you come to the surface you stay too long your Long's on your way to the surface gonna expand back and then your residual volume of I already have left and your and your lungs it becomes really really small so then the presenters becomes too low and then you pass what becomes too well the percentage percentage of oxygen any lungs become too small and then you just pass out so basically you brain shuts down to make sure that a lack of oxygen is not creating any permanent damages oh it's actually a nice port not in that time but then that's what happens with people is that when it comes back up if your buddy is not watching you and that's why I spin fishing is a team sport if they're not watching you if you pass out in the water what if they pass out you're gonna sink right down you're both doing at the same time well normally well the good system to dive is one person dives at the bottom the person is watching the other one oh and it's one one down one up one down and then you you you watch each other's back is that what happened with you yeah I was actually very lucky um the guy I was diving with me lost his brother few years before to a blackout so he was Jesus he was looking at me very very closely and I was I was beyond grateful to see space at his surface I knew it and I was going to black out so how'd you know you're gonna black out because it was I dove down and I was aiming in the fish it was pretty deep I was at like 85 feet and I aim for fish he was in a pole spear she wasn't in a gun and I missed it and I started shooting in the water and then I miss it again I was like god damn it and then I realized it was like whoa I'm actually pretty deep in him I've been there for quite a while so I started panicking a little bit so when you panic you let air even more which is completely stupid and then I started finding finding finning and then you have you start doing nothing so finding Yang's waning finning whenever you have your work fins mmhmm yeah exactly and then what happens first before you black out is you have a loss of motor control so I could start feeling I could feel like my body making like weird movements and then I knew that I was out of oxygen and then I knew that I would probably most probably going to pass up and then I came back and came back and the nice lot of my friend I was watching and I was like I really hope you watching me hope you're really watching and he grabbed me and he woke me up and it was how far were you from the surface and you blacked out I blacked out a surface Oh at the surface yes which is why it's called a shallow water blackout because even if you're in deeper water it most of the time happens at the surface so when you got to the surface what did you have to do to wake you up you have to take the mask off you have to keep the head off the water and then you have to blow in the ice because you have a high concentration of nerves you slap a little bit not too hard [Laughter] named and then you don't really wake up pretty pretty fast unless you inhale water what did you was it like you had a dream like if you get choked out like one of the things that happens when you get choked out as you wake up it's like you're dreaming like what whoa I was at a disco I was riding my skateboard like it's weird I've never been choked out to the point of passing out I would imagine so luckily for me but yeah I missed out long in a few a few minutes and I just wasn't sure what's going on and then you just you just done for the day when it happened it's been yeah you have to be done huh it's yeah for the the risk of getting another one the same day it's actually very high Wow so once you shut off you get shut off again yeah so you have to wait at least a following day to get back and I'll jump back in the next day I think I did it was the day after I really want to go back into water as soon as possible just to jump back on the horse yeah so at night I was a little bit stressed out and my friend gave me some kratom and it was fun oh that's I think that stuff that kratom was I didn't think it was a drug I thought it was a mild stimulant I heard that people take it for pain but I thought that when they're taking it for pain that they're not getting high they're just taking and it alleviates pain like Advil or something like that and then I took I think I took eight of them eight or ten which is a lot because I know Chris Bell takes like ten always like it's a pill yeah okay I took it in powder it makes with like yeah this is just the powder in pill form and I was high as fuck oh okay now I know why people are nervous about this stuff I mean but the weird thing is I was high but my body was very functional like I was high but I wasn't uncoordinated I wasn't like knocking things over it wasn't that everything worked normal like everything was was moving and as I wanted it to move but I was like whoa it is an opiate it operates on your opiate receptors in some sort of strange way which is one of the reasons why they're making the argument that it should be illegal but is if any opiate is legal it should be that one because it helps people tremendously with addiction tremendously with pain it doesn't seem to be toxic to the point where it can kill you or it's very very rare that it does it's to operate in a completely different way than any other opiate and like I said even though I was definitely high like I was definitely under the influence of something nobody I don't think anybody knew I mean I could have conversations with people but in the back of my house but I'm talking to people and it was all totally normal I wasn't driving but if I was driving I think I'd be fine I'm fine I was fine walk I think even worked out yeah it's just it's just operates in a very different way it's um I've never I mean I've had my knee operation I had one of my knee operations they gave me a morphine button like when I was in the hospital like they said if you want more if we can just press that button it'll give you some morphine what's he once you get high off the morphine you're in the hospital it was great keep pressing the button in the pain of the knees it was on also my knee was on this motion machine right after the the surgery was done they put me on this machine that extends and contracts your name okay yeah brings it back and forth and that's not comfortable but when you hit that morphine pad right that's fun but other than that I never really have had opiates I don't think except they gave me a pain pill prescription I don't remember what kind it was it was vicodin our percocets or one of those I took it once and I hated it it just made me feel really stupid I think I just remember thinking my brains just really dull and I still could feel the pain I just didn't care it was weird you know so those morphine buttons are very dangerous when I got my operation I was I keep pressing the button seems pretty fun yeah well it's time to go home and I stood up and I fell right on my face I had a complete faceplant really yeah like an actually complete faceplant Oh what were you in the hospital for I was a vernian hernia yeah and they didn't ask you like how many times you press that button Valentine it is they definitely didn't seem to have taking into consideration my weight oh yeah right why wouldn't they ask you how many times you press the button before they let you get up I but I remembered a woman being like didn't there's being like like you had you had a law you sure you want more you shoot that much it was like bringing it what you're under the influence of it I imagine you don't really worry about it now you know well listen Valentine I'm glad we did this was really fun I'm glad we had this conversation I think like I said I think what you're trying to do with your life is admirable life is short I wish more people would chase their dreams and live their lives in a way that they want rather than just jump into the fucking rat race I'm definitely definitely not regretting any second of it so I'm happy I did that and thank you so much for having me here and it's crazy how you came up if I was asking a friend of mine podcast to listen and he talked to me about yours so ever I was sitting at a beach in the Bahamas and my friend Arun s that went to law school with me it was like oh you should listen to dragon podcast is awesome I look you up in history I'm gonna say you were following me I was like nice oh there we go well we did it thanks for doing this and I hope maybe this opens up some doors for you and some things happen well cool stuff stop hiding behind their clothes mine an opinion I think see I think it's slowly but surely conversations like this they'll open doors and and and change people's perceptions and that's that's what I hope people got out of it that's good if I have one message today is talk about it know where you food come from and don't be don't be scared to see what's going on and live the life to the way you want and that's what you're doing oh yeah get out of your comfort zone because you're never gonna discovered a Christian Yarbrough staying in there boom [Music]
