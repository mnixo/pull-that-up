others out there have the answer a real solid answer for the Chael Sonnen so isn't that weird that BJ would would not have a card like that that he wouldn't have this Ninja Assassin guard like Shinya Aoki yeah yeah yeah yeah you know why because he didn't uh and I can I would say this I mean I've told this to BJT I'm like you know what if you stay at 55 there's really no reason to master any kind of guard just get back up you're fucking everybody you're better than everybody standing up nobody at 55 can take you down even big wrestlers can take you down I even thought he doesn't need it he doesn't really need a purpose on his guard I thought he didn't need to develop and I really didn't even you know kiyah it was interested in the rubber guard and he fucks with it a little bit you know what I mean but he I'm sure he felt like no one's gonna put me on my fucking back but maybe now now that he knows like shit these fighters are getting so much better and there's so many wrestlers out there you really have to have the answer for Chael Sonnen and for like Frankie Edgar and for a man yeah for these elite wrestlers like what he did to Pharrell Florian yeah he took him down and got on top when they talked about your guard the only answer for the elite wrestler and they're all then all over the top ten of every UFC white division the only answer or one of the only there's only a couple answers and one of them is having a when they talk about your guard they don't say that it's just oh man he's got an okay guard it's a decent guard they have to say your guard is a fuck amazing like don't go in his guard your guard has to be like Ryan Hall your guard has to be like Shinya Aoki you don't wanna fucking be in your play grade like Anthony Pettis and Shane roller when Anthony Pettis slapped on that truck exactly you have to have a super dangerous guard if they are not if people don't talk about your guard like it's amazing and it's fucking crazy wicked and they it's one of the best guards in your division then you're not good enough you don't have the answer for the elite wrestler most of the time sometimes you throw up but you know a pop triangle and it lands like Anderson Silva made it work in the fifth round Chris Leben made that pop triangle work and you know that Nogueira style triangle it worked that works it does work but um not at the highest rate you know there's there's a lot of things that you could do as well to add to already game you know to those nogueira triangles you could mix it all up there's a lot of things you can do just look at what Shinya Aoki has done look at what Dustin hayslett has done look at what Matt hora which is done just pay attention it's out there you can watch it on YouTube you can do it too you need to have the answer for the elite wrestler and man having a crazy wicked guard can be the answer what do you think about James Toney I mean you know I was pulling for him at first yeah well I took that box I I thought that these MMA guys really didn't know these had when you're a boxer near that high rate of a boxer you know you really don't know these guys can hit in their hands and their timing and they're right and shit but when I watched the countdown was when I was like he didn't work he didn't work he got a great opportunity to represent boxing but he didn't work you don't think he worked out I lost a lot of weight he lost 15 pounds that's eight months okay if you're rolling any student lost 60 in a couple months if you're really fucking rolling let's say you take this guy on you got four months the first month all you do with him you're not working his hands they're already there so you're basically working him getting up and just rolling little things just surviving online right there all those things I'll thank you know when I used to go to judo when I was a kid I was skinny as shit because the hardest thing about judo isn't flipping its every time you get up and fucking down you get up and down 50 times a day that that you get skinny this guy didn't do that he got some guy from the FBI to come in and train that guy yeah what the fuck you know I'm in Hollywood with Liddell I'm rolling I'm rolling what I'm starting I'm learning the basics how to grow what how much can I learn in four months to get me out of a mess right that's what I'm learning he didn't know any better you know he didn't know when he got a guy from the FBI that God knows if they fucking paid up what was the guy who trained him to Kempo videos of him online doing khempo with me guys I come behind and cut his legs and stuff James Stone is the guy was trained James Toney yeah it's on the underground I say James Toney actually doing it Wow mean he you know he did look the guy set up a program for him but what does a guy know for real you know what he really needed to do is go to Colorado Springs and train the Olympic Training Center he needed to get a guy who's a fucking jujitsu master to come with them okay these guys are gonna take you down you gonna do your best to stop the takedown then once they get you taken down then you get a working guard that's what you need to do when I watch the countdown show but was very clear to me that the guys he was working out with we're letting him do things for the camera and that it was they weren't elite grapplers they were letting him do things I was like ah look it was a demonstration like anytime you know change rolled all over like I can't believe he's doing this it's like they were like letting him do they're putting on a show or letting James throw them around yeah I was like this is silly I'm like he might not know how anything about grappling yeah there was this dude that fought Javy Vasquez back at my first king of the cage show in 2000 he comes out and claims he's a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt he's this French karate guy and he thought back then he just got his mm like you could just say shit like that and so Hobbie said I'll take the he said he's been training jiu-jitsu 12 years and he's a black belt under hoist Gracie that's what I was telling Terry trouble cock and Tara's note I think we got a live one here he calls her boys grace in the Academy they never heard of the guy the guy's bullshit he's trying to scare javi into going to the ground with him and javi was a purple belt but a good mad destroyer on the local Southern California scene he would go to Santa Santa Cruz as well and smash he was the fucking destroyer of the purple belts division and there wasn't very many Browns and blacks at that point and he was going to go against this guy who claimed to be a black belt dude Hobbit took him down and like the guy had no training dude zeroed had his he's laid flat on his back and he tapped really crooked Bobby pounded him a couple times he just happened it was over he's like what the fuck was that that's an interesting story but a much more interesting story is the other guy that we know that claim to be a Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt that really didn't know anything that turned out to be a murderer yes yeah there was a dude we knew his fake name is Raphael Torre yeah but his real name was his real name damn I don't remember but he told people he he taught karate to cry his whole life and he taught karate and he told people he was a black bombers jiu-jitsu this guy Eddie was hanging around with this guy they were you were he was decided as Brazilian he says website right he was out he was a writer he was probably one of the most popular journalists back down on the underground I mean Raphael tours all over the underground it was 2000 it was still in the dark ages so it wasn't easy for a guy to bust up and he was on his feet all the time I didn't notice it until like you know years later so he would work hard he would always have shit and pride loved him he always had reports he only had interviews oh dude he was look probably that one of the top three riders in all of em well I remember he was very productive and he would do you know he was doing his version of gonzo journalism for MMA like asking MMA fighters if they like anal sex it was like being a real crazy yeah that's that was my shit so it turned out that this dude wasn't really a black belt at all and we we you know and it wasn't half brazilian yeah it was like it was all crazy we were driving and Eddie head of this confrontation with him on the phone to make a long story short homeboy winds up killing some dudes strangling him to death the husband of this chick that he's banging and he winds up going to jail for it I mean he was he was a murderer he got this guy insurance yeah yeah yeah the the wife of this guy that he strangled you know so they decided to set this up and he choked the guy to death yeah kill the guy would really make it shows how ironic is it that his black belt wasn't legit but he killed someone with her rear naked choke yeah poor guy killed he trained at all and probably didn't even see it coming just jumped him and choked the shit out of him keep managing that man your fucking wife is banging some other dude and that dude comes to your house and kills you didn't got his house a diamond gym yeah and I testified on that trial did you really yeah you had to go to court and just finger him and they called to me they called me two cops called me because I called Gerald once and when I was talking to Gerald on the phone the phone was being tapped and jailed and I are talking about you know his uh you know possibility of him fight in the UFC who's you want to fight this nappa Baba and Rafael Tory's name comes up and I'm like what's going on with that dude and so Gerald was like being tapped and he was like talking all these different people about it and then you know the everybody that he talked to on the phone they had to talk to the cops but I didn't really know anything I didn't know the guy I just knew the guy through ready unfortunately I would fucking go to court about that yeah so would you have to say now that guy's fake he's a liar basically yeah I forget the questions they made me ask but dude I hung out with that like he was always brought in and whatever sure I was commentating whether it was king of the cage or pride or even a too hot to handle he was always the reporter who's gonna blow up handle was in Holland right yeah that's what I mean boss dude and and he was he was so busy he be so amped up on speed he always had articles and to blow up shows you bring Raphael Torah and he'll blow it all up all over the Internet always on speed huh how'd you find out he was always on speed it came out later on the trial do you know Ari took a Woods are called adderall took an adderall says it's the fucking greatest thing ever forgetting things done I said just cleaned out this dude yeah but why is his speed can help you get organized but why does that work how does it give you fucking energy what the fuck you feel like you could do anything you just want to paint the fucking house you want to go to college let's try the fucking Louisiana is it bad for you is it bad for you dude come on it's got it's gotta be right I gotta be what comes up must come down right there anything that speeds you out has got to be bad for that's like super but it's not just super speed you out it makes you like really organized Robert Schimmel told me once he took one accidentally and he said he just started organizing all of his notes just that's what happens in handy speed too well we think that you could use that though as a tool if you could really make sure you didn't do too much of it and didn't fuck up your whole system and short-circuit and everything like every now and then we knew yeah I think but the problem is you come down so hard that you want more to you come tomorrow matter oh I don't know about adderall but anything speeding psychos up comes down Oh what Cuddy was on it every day are you what does he say buddies I know I said he loves it helps him organize helps him work and he's pretty fucking ambitious he's he's a hard worker but he said he was just really listless and couldn't get anything going on and you know and they got him on the adderall and then BAM you know I just couldn't focus and concentrate on things he just had a hard time committing to things concentrating who knows maybe it works different than speed because speed somehow I don't know how it works really well by Athena speed and that's the fuel of the capitalist society I mean look we're the fucking were the were the people who litter in coffee every day we have a in every union contract they have that they negotiate a time well you could take a drug there's a fucking coffee break you know when union contracts have coffee break time what is a concrete bit called a regular at work it's fucking 11:00 a.m. it's not quite lunch yet coffee truck pulls up and you get a chance to take fucking 5-10 minutes off and and fuel up on some some stimulants it's good for the company you come back out jazz in charge and you feel better you work harder you feel better and you feel like you got another little break you know that's the night that's Union things is one thing they figured out that was smart you know look everybody isn't have to be a slave like people like yo against unions at unions fuck up business and you they don't work hard and they make too much money and papa they make work easier and that's good all right it's not good to have people work like fucking slaves you know wouldn't it be better if they got a little bit less done but everybody was more happy wouldn't that be better they get a nice coffee break you get to relax for an hour for lunch where they don't feel like they're getting tortured all day you know maybe if they got some shit to do during lunch they can go somewhere and fucking pay a bill or you know pick up a fucking thing that they were supposed to buy faster those hours go by god damn it our break our breaking shit talking about coffee break is it smoke break it is it for its 4:20 on the night just walk out of
