the girag an experience you took a long time off you took like six years off and then came back again in 2010 for one fight well uh yeah I came back for that any because I got I got pretty chill I put in prison and the you know it was funny because after I got out of prison it was on national TV it was in all the newspapers magazines funny how I start fading out of the media all of a sudden I get arrested I'm like a pop thing in the media again and I say far as a shocker so that's why you mean on the media event you know but anyway you know I when I got out you know when I would go to bars and stuff he would say uh some people would say like oh I see me on TV and I'm like fuck I think to myself is that the one with me handcuffed walking police or was no idea god I hated that you know so I figured you know the only way to tell show um make it up to my fans now that I'm know that I'm back you know we get drug tested in Japan we get marijuana's a big thing now in Japan we get tested for marijuana if you have any marijuana your blood and Japan you're not gonna be able to fight us what did you get arrested for know what happened well I had a 16 grams in my car I had a great 20 joints I had we're gonna have a little party in Roppongi and was on the way down and they do a lot of inspections just randomly they walk around in Japan it's kind of unconstitutional where they don't need a reason to search you they'll come right up to your car and say I wanna check in your car and it's like I was stolen and I had a head of joint I mean a rotor on the dashboard and you know when you're still and you think you're getting sneaky with you it's like so bad as they uh what what roads I put in my pocket and they're deer following me the whole time like this in their pocket and I'm like so I put put my phone in the pocket pull it behind my phone said nothing I'm walking this is be on your phone fuck so but how like what is it like is it like being caught with cocaine yeah I was like the drugs a drug in Japan yeah so doesn't matter we understand yeah so I um I was facing some bad time you know because I was a famous figure and they wanted to make an example of me so Wow what was worst case scenario I think was five years fuck yeah so I was facing that arm it all depended on what came up in my house in my gym when he did the search next day Wow and what came out nothing nothing so that's a view yeah well I was kind of baffled until my fucking weed yeah so you know nothing came up so um it was then they the interrogation came to finding out where I got my stuff oh yeah and you know so when in Japan if you throw everything to a foreign person they'll drop they won't want to go find someone in America I'm I told me I was a student from Guam Oh I mean just rude I asked me for her name and I said Tony I knew like three Tony's and Guam's I keep it real Tony and and we had like two days of questioning I mean you talking interrogation for like eight hours straight just interrogation and lay like the third day they said so happened caught me off guard man and they asked me what's Tony's last name and this frickin ridiculous the first name that pops it was Montana what I said throw what I said Montana I'll see this whole fuck if these guys watch Scarface I'll see I'm screwed you know screwed because they'll start the integration all over if I get caught in a lie right right right so he just I saw him write it down in Japanese Montana and then he just jot it down and I was like hey Scarface the Scarface get translated into Japanese not that popular I don't think it's that popular there yeah that's fucking hilarious Tony Montana gave me my marijuana you know how long was ores worth the trip in how long was your how long was the ordeal from getting arrested to getting cleared 28 days which isn't a big deal if you know it's gonna be 28 days when you're sitting in there and you don't know what's gonna happen you you don't know what's going on an outside world because you're shut off and you're wondering if you're gonna spend five years it's kind of twenty days is a long 28 days Wow so you went from there and you said fuck it I'm gonna I'm gonna take on another fight so I went in there and uh it was good for me actually I mean I always think back and think okay I should have done this I should have done this if I didn't put the rose to that and I keep thinking and I catch myself wait a minute this is uh probably one of the best things that happened to you because the big biggest thing that happened to me in that was I I learned how important my freedom was I mean everyone takes up a grand every day wake up well what are you gonna do today on this like shit I got nothing to do is freaking overcast the shitty day what I'm gonna do is like how damn is this a shitty day you know but man just the fact that you can choose to stay at home you can choose to eat McDonald's you can choose to just hang out or you can choose to be bored you know freedom that freedoms awesome so it was something that really made me realize that how important freedom was yeah a lot of people take it for granted you know you dealing with a situation like that especially over something like weed where it's so nonsensical and crazy they could take away your freedom for fucking years yeah the thing about that is I I serve the time went to the court we I got a three years probation where I couldn't leave Japan for three years I didn't even get to go to my grandmother's funeral and I figured okay I got us it'll be good these three years and I will start up again and then next thing I know I get a letter from the Democrat Elling me that I I just lost my green card because of infringement and I got a leave Japan whoa I'm like whoa wait a minute I've been here for 20 years my whole life is here I bought a house there I got gyms here maybe I can't leave Japan so I called him up and they we had this like this road generic answer okay if you're contesting it you're going to start an investigation you have to come down to immigration center and blah blah blah went down to go was an eight-month investigation I mean it was ridiculous I mean money to go down there numerous times and just like all day interrogations and it would start from the beginning the name of your mom and dad what do they do I'm like what the fuck does that have to do anything and I'm I'm just going along with the roll and it's like the next week I go in for another interrogation they start all over again a whole new investigator I'm like what the fuck's going on I just told the other guy you know and it got to a point it was so bad that I got so frustrated in there as much as I needed to be in Japan I looked at I said you know what I love Japan I made this place my home and the fucking Japan doesn't want me I don't want to fucking be here I tell him straight up like that and I was like I said well should I just screwed myself man I thought you know that's so frustrating I say you know if you you know I served my time and and I'm and I'm trying to do I'm doing good things for Japan you know and you guys gonna try and kick me out if you guys don't want me you know I don't want to fucking beer if don't didn't want him here you know so you know the interrogation went on and there was one guy that was a fan of mine when he wasn't aerating me and then he he kind of did something illegal where he he told me that the between these two red markers said look at those two favors he said he flipped it open he said this is all petitions coming in for you not to get kicked out of Japan and I saw the papers like this thick as I go shit that's a lot he said yeah you got like four thousand and already and the petition Japan isn't just names you gotta leave your name your phone number your address and everything you know see it's not a bullshit where you can just get people to sign their names just right someday yeah so they're writing this four thousand and every time we get integration I see that that between those two red markers eating thicker and thicker and I come to find at the end it came out to be nine thousand in eight months nine thousand people sent in that they don't want me to tell Japan and immigration is there to protect Japan from dangerous so-called dangerous foreigners so when they're there people that they're supposed to be protecting is sending nine thousand letters saying they don't want this guy kicked out so that was the overriding those I kept you I could have been deported yeah
