the Joe Rogan experience what are the other things that are of concern to you as a congresswoman that you're seeing not addressed or that are somehow or another still in place when you feel like they should have been around you know there's there's there's there's a long laundry list of issues and I think you can go through each of the major issues that a lot of folks are concerned about and pick those apart and say hey here are the things that we need to address and improve in each of those but I think the conversation that I hope more people start having is about how why aren't these things being fixed or addressed and that that speaks directly to people's unwillingness to actually talk to each other to stop demonizing each other because you're from the other camp and actually engage based on our common mission of serving the people serving the people of this country and you know that's something I look back to during my time in uniform serving the high Army National Guard you got diverse people diverse opinions diverse ideas that ultimately you know we wear the same flag on our uniform and we are focused singler Leon on that same purpose and mission and unfortunately that's what we're missing a lot of in Congress is the hyper partisanship and the political winds too often take precedence over the reason why people in our districts hire us to go and work there and a lot of that comes from not having a basic level of respect or Aloha for each other as people and instead just saying hey it's us against them pick your label and that's where the battles are fought and and who suffers as a result it's the people who are suffering and we're dealing with a lot of the challenges that we've been talking about so that's something that you know I try to bring I try to bring Hawaii's Aloha to Washington and try to bring that through in the work that I'm trying to do on these different issues in the conversations that we're having sometimes it means you talk with people who who you disagree with or you may have different ideas than they have about how you solve these problems but if even if you're able to come together on thing then we can start to see problems actually being solved and delivering results I don't know but he made sure I went to the place that they broke you see Huntington was designed as the prison if he raped another inmate they sent you her it was the first shoe program in America it was the first really what a shoe program a special housing unit or security housing unit were level 5 Supermax you know like Pelican Bay and your punishment was that you weren't allowed to speak in yourself and if you got caught speaking in yourself they came in with a nurse and they after they beat you down she jabs Yuna asked with Thorazine and they knocked you out for a week and you lost your mind so it was horrible like I told you the first two years of my sentence every day I kept my mouth shut I didn't care what was done around me you know you weren't allowed to say a goddamn word and a meant it and you know a lot of talk to other inmates nothing I dare you to sing happy birthday to yourself like I did I paid for that one they fucked me up Joe but I don't care about that look I realized I was in a race I had to kill off the person that I was the person that I initially was upon entering prison was a deceitful lying coward but no fortitude because no self-respect resided within me and in utter humbleness I took everything that they did to me and I paid for every window I broke everything I stole reliable and then I started to love myself I figured ain't get nothing out of this but misery so I'm going out like the dude must stand up and I must speak beautifully on the day they execute me i'ma walk to that walk man i'ma do dis I didn't kill that woman but I damn sure ain't no coward I'm gonna find out everything I can about life and then I'm gonna face my death i'ma do it was yada V man like I had this beautiful beautiful speech ready for him to I was gonna lay it out and just be a piece because I realized there was nothing else to do I couldn't fight I couldn't argue it didn't matter because gods in control my life and I really believed that I had a choice either be a bitter pill and get sucked dry by all the misery around me or get my shit right and start loving myself and then when I'm out of I can't stand so cuz sometimes when you watch a tape in fight camp like you can mess with people's heads you know like maybe maybe Kyle was getting too nervous and then when he's white gives him anxiety to watch the fight you know so you have it if that's the case you know have a coach that's willing to the you trust to do that for you that's good point yeah let me do it it's a mental this fucking sports a mental mind fuck man yeah you know whatever works the best for you is that you got to figure out is it better for you to fight someone like Cody that you have all this animosity and beef towards and all the shit talking cuz you get super hyped up and motivated every day or is it better to fight someone who you have a lot of respect for was just a good challenge I think you got to learn to have like to be the same person for every fight you know I think it's like control those emotions you know you bro there was all that coming in like I'm nervous to fight you know like forget all the bullshit you know and I had to learn that through my career I had to learn to take emotion out of it I'm even in sparring still you know like Johnny's always told me control my emotion controlled aggression you know because you hit me I want to hit you back I'm very competitive so it's something you have to learn how to control and how to do that throughout my career and I think everyone else learn to control either to let go or to pull back you know I'm like really control that emotion to be the same person every fight you know mentally mentally not the same person every five but mentally like in your own head the same person but technically need to be able to switch it up that the mental aspect of it is probably the thing that holds more people back than anything like we all know of guys that are just monsters in the gym and for whatever it was when they would go to compete they just could never be their full self yeah TJ does better in the cage yeah he does in the gym yeah yeah I was always what I did better in the in the gym than in the cage what do you think it is that makes you do better I love it I don't know I've just taught myself to love this shit like I am I don't know when I get out there it's just like I want to be there you know I know everyone's nervous and like there's like it's the highest highs but I used to be so nervous that I forget like what happened in the fight you know but throughout my career I think after the Mikey stand fights when I really started to like hone in are during the Mikey stand fight is when I really started to hone in and have fun and just realize like fuck this shit man like what's the worst is gonna happen you knocked out go for it you know it's a crazy subject right I mean you and I have known each other since 2012 when I did meat-eater you were there filming when I shot my first deer which is very important part of my life man and then you went on to direct and produce parts unknown with our late friend Anthony Bourdain and we just thought it'd probably be a good thing to come in here and just talk talk about him yeah and and I'm really grateful for it you know it's actually you know a lot of people have been saying to me like oh it must be really hard to talk about that I must really it's I actually find it kind of the opposite like I want to talk about him I want to talk about who he was and what that experience was you know so thanks ma'am my pleasure brother did you did you know him before you guys started working together no no I met Tony 10 years ago and I was called in he had a DP on a show who at the last minute cancelled couldn't go to Egypt so I got a call like a week before you know it's like do you want to go to Egypt with Anthony Bourdain fuck yeah absolutely and and so I met him in Cairo man like kind of like perfect yeah exactly the episode when you guys eat a camel no no it is a camel no but um you know I met him there you know we start filming or on the streets of Cairo and like you know it's like all of a sudden is thrown in these kitchens like we're eating pigeon you know it's like go and cover them cooking pigeon and good I had seen the show like maybe once before but I didn't I knew who he was and I knew what that adventure was right you know and I was so amped for it and then there was like this seminal moment on that show where we go out and we we go ripping across the desert with the Bedouins and go out and cook a goat in the ground you know and so as we're driving out over the desert like well we need we need some shots from car to car right and I was like I'll get on the roof you know and and there's like this for for some reason there's a four-post bed tied to the roof of this Land Rover and so I get up there and kind of like gonna latch my arm around it and these guys take off at I swear 80 miles an hour across the desert I mean and you're on a bed absolutely absolutely no regard for the fact that like I'm on the roof you know shooting and and when we got there we got to camp I survived it I had this big black and blue where I was holding on to the four-post bed night I go over in a show Tony and that was it man from that moment on it was like I like this guy and I started going out with him you know I started getting invited to do more shows [Applause]
