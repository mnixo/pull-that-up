hello freak bitches we all know there's treatment different treatment libraries well especially in Scientology right yeah it's highlighted it is like nothing you could ever imagine it is so when people say Tom doesn't leave because they have information on him or John that's not the reason the amount of power they receive from this church is like nothing in Hollywood it is like nothing there is no reason for them to leave this environment right so it's super beneficial for them to be attached to it correct he has employees they work for him all these people will take care of his every need yes and there's policy on how to talk to somebody like you wouldn't say like if you said go get me go get me a coffee and I wanted this temperature there's no I can't get it we're five miles from any you know a 30-month there would be none of that kind of talk like not any kind there's policy about don't you don't talk back like ever you don't step out of line you don't give an opinion you don't make a face you don't make a gesture you don't sigh if you step out of line in any way you are dealt with by the church so essentially has servants correct how many people like a lot a lot a lot and by the way I don't begrudge somebody would have staff like if you can have it I go do it all day all night do it all day all night but when you believe as a Scientologist you are working for somebody who's single-handedly is saving the planet and you deserve that kind of punishment that's something different baby you understand working like that that's it's an abuse that is not justified but it is justified because you believe that you are single-handedly saving the planet mmm capiche yeah no I get it I get it so so he's the main figurehead right he's the main guy like right up with Miscavige right and then John Travolta is somewhere in that I think John was given what a designation called kakan where a pump kakan not can't become yeah calm ok h a KH am cacao okay okay he's given this designation of cacao which there's a policy that basically says you can kill another human being if you work a cond you're gonna look the other way and he was given that he was given that by l ron hubbard sometimes you work on a car vault not very well you nobody takes i ruin because okay like Kevin goes don't don't ruin this take I go no don't you're gonna do and then he would do some stupid shit with his hands or something that he never rehearsed cry from laughter ah yes and he was really highly inappropriate moments that made me pee almost people yeah okay yeah so he's a lot of kill people yeah did one are you I don't know I don't I I should look at the policy again I don't want to us we get it but you're supposed to look the other way so like if somebody said something wrong to John Travolta a samurai sword and cut their head off you just gotta clean up the body it's called ethics protection oh yeah so everyone would be responsible for dealing with it dealing with it yes just leave the room and he would know that you guys would take care of it correct and there's also another policy and by the way the reason why I say these policies is because I don't like when people say Lee I believe you I don't want you to believe me I want you to look it up I want you to look for yourself and make your own decision so I keep quoting these policies because I want people to look it up so that they can say that's shit's true she's not talking shit you know I mean right there's another policy called ethics protection there's another policy called the responsibility the responsibility of leaders which he actually says exactly what you just said that basically you know you what you got to do to protect a leader you got to do it if you see a body then you clean it up when the leaders should never know [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
