the jello can experience the neuroscience stuff is like my bread and butter that's what I love and that is the holy grail of neuroscience when you hear like Deepak Chopra type dudes talk about consciousness being non my role like Deepak Chopra I just it's really hard for me to not just discount everything he says really everything it's I mean I know there's and Chopra Eckhart Tolle that's hilarious Robbins is that his name Greg Fitzsimmons loves Eckhart Tolle he's totally probably the least huckster e of all of them but he's still well what do you think is huckster e about providing motivation to people and giving people sort of a framework to work on as far as living in the now and taking charge of their life especially if it's something that someone like Eckhart Tolle had personal so compared somebody like Eckhart Tolle to Robbins yeah compare and Eckhart Tolle Oren Anthony Robbins - for example somebody like oh what's his name I was able to know I was able to interview this this really interesting guy who has a PhD in molecular genetics and then moved to the Himalayas to become a Buddhist monk his name is Matthieu Ricard and he's he's a French buddhist monk and he talks about mindfulness meditation and he talks about the neuroscience of the things that the Tibetans are doing right now but he's not trying to make money off of it mm-hmm and I think that is a fundamental kind of red flag for me I'm not saying just because somebody's trying to make money they are selling snake oil but first of all what's the motivation that that has to be the first red flag and then you go into what is it that they're saying if they're talking if they're trying to use science and they're trying to kind of go in and pick and choose the science that tells the story the right way and then they're making these really broad leaps from that science it makes me nervous so it's it's one thing if you've got like a motivational speaker who's just like I know this about the world and I'm not basing it on anything but if you like me come follow me and it's like it's I mean what is that that's like culty behavior but that's fine but when people pick and choose how they want to use science and how they want a bastard itis science to meet their needs it makes me nervous I did a piece recently about the power of positive thinking I've also known a piece about the power of prayer and I went through the literature and I tried to find examples where positive thinking actually helped people and there's just no good evidence that thinking positively is going to actually bring goodwill to your life like like the secret you know this like well if I just want it bad enough I'm gonna make a bunch of money it's like no if you want it bad enough you're gonna have to fucking work for it and then it's gonna come to you and actually they find that the power of positive thinking can actually be kind of detrimental to cancer patients because it causes a whole extra layer of guilt to the process of dying you know you caused this to yourself exactly because you didn't you didn't think positively enough you didn't will yourself out of this and there's a whole culture around that in America where we kind of blame the victims yeah and where we call cancer survivors survivors and we call cancer victims victims you know and it's like and and you're not doing so well nobody says it directly to somebody who's dying of cancer well you didn't will yourself out of it but they feel that because they say it indirectly to the people who are coming out of it oh it was all that nice prayer and all those positive thoughts and all those Oprah magazines you read you know and it's like I don't know I think that's a bad precedent to set it's also shitty science because if you're you know you're only looking at the group that was successful exactly I tried to look at a lot of those studies and I tried to compare you know and and I found enough stuff out there that kind of shows that the power of positive thinking is not a real thing also prayer is not a real I disagree to the power of positive thinking is not a real thing I think it's a good way to operate and live your life in a happy manner and yeah we'll probably lend you to being more successful you'll have less hurdles it's like it's like talking about Karma you know like in some sense karma is totally real because if you're a fucking nice person yeah and you're just you you do goodwill all over the time sometimes shitty things are gonna happen to you but most people are going to be nice to you too if you put bad karma out there to me what that really means is if you're just a fucking asshole all the time people are gonna be an asshole back to you like that's obvious but I don't believe that karma is some sort of cosmic force that says you you store up goodwill with the universe and then the universe pays you back well the last time you were here you coined a phrase or you used a phrase that I have stolen and have used over and over and over again I give you credit but it's whoop Edler oh yeah yeah lovely box Oprah yeah yeah yeah yeah I totally didn't coin that but I loved it too every time I see that dude I just think wow peddler yeah didn't we have a little kind of Twitter thing with him yeah yeah I was called I asked if he was old much yeah and then it was something about him saying like I am a god and you were like pedal much and he was like wow it was really funny I favored it yeah he's actually like good sense of humor about it I don't think he takes himself totally seriously yeah he's not like cult leader seriously I think he gets a gets ahead of himself and he says some really ridiculous shit and then when people call him on it you know he just starts using the word quantum quantum consciousness is rude you know I think better him than a lot of other people in his position better him than you know that Kevin Trudeau guy that selling you weight lock secrets that they don't want you to know about it doesn't seem like depot I mean Deepak is trying to sell his books but outside of that I don't really feel like he is that much of you know like a predator like he's not using this kind of pseudoscience and and truth be told there is a little bit of truth to some of the things that he talks about but but he does kind of I think step way outside of the boundaries of what's reasonable and healthy but you're right I don't think he's actually trying to take advantage of people fundamentally I think that Deepak Chopra thinks what he's talking he believes and what he's talking about and I think that he actually thinks that he's helping people maybe he is helping some people but he's also peddling a lot of will I think I think he probably is helping a lot I think he's definitely peddling a lot of woo and one thing that I always get out of him is that I don't think even he knows what he's saying there's a lot of times where well people will try to impress upon you than what they're saying is important and one of the ways they do that is by using these like really kind of like vague terms that sound fantastic yeah I mean that's really I think where that term pseudoscience comes from it's not real science it's it's it's fake science it's bad science but it sort of sounds like science to an untrained ear and that's the dangerous thing is if you throw around a lot of really big words and you are really authoritative a lot of people kind of believe what you're telling them what also there's an issue in that some of it does have some truth to it and when you fuck around and pretend that it all does well you mush it all together you you you create this really cloudy atmosphere I'm not sure what the fuck you're saying and I'm not sure if it's true and it's really hard for like an everyday person who goes okay well I've heard that before and you know my doctor told me that and you know that seems important and then they throw in all these other things well I mean if you're an authority figure and you're saying all these things that are true I guess I should believe you and you say all these other things it's really dangerous you know he says I was an atheist hashtag until I discovered I was God and then I said son don't make me smack you woo pedo but and then he responded he responded something really funny I don't know if you can find it yeah like I well you know he did a thing with his son where his son followed him around with a camera and completely exposed him and he went on tour like promoted this with his son and did like interviews on like Opie and Anthony all these different places but one of them was like his son like caught him sleeping when he was supposed to be meditating I'm going to the temple to meditate they go into the temple he's he's completely out cold why does back it's it's it's quite funny because his son sort of you know grew up with him and sons and fathers have notoriously contentious relationships I'm always incredibly impressed when I mean a daughter who gets along great with her mom or his son who gets along great with his dad because somewhere along the line and those male male female female relationships there seems to be this like changing at a guard or something like that or this need to be your own person and Deepak son has that shit in buckets buckets full of that but it's cool that Deepak doesn't really take himself too seriously it's cool that he you know his son catches him asleep and he's a I was not good I was traveling my third eye was open to the possibilities yeah he did a interview or a debate rather with Richard Dawkins fairly recently on I think it was he was challenging Dawkins on the concept of atheism and you know and Dawkins was being his Qadri old yeah kunti so but it actually made it actually made him Dawkins look bad yeah and I mean that's the thing it's it's when you engage in those kinds of conversations with people who can really hold their own you've got to be really careful because Dawkins I think he's take and I respect the man immensely his take is very much an educated you know I'm an evolutionist I'm an evolutionary biologist these are the reasons that I don't believe in God but he's very hard lined about it and there is something about being this kind of ivory tower British elite that just kind of makes you seem like a dick even like he's not a dick he's a really sweet man I've met him before he's he's soft-spoken and but the truth is you you put those two men in a room together I mean Deepak knows what he's doing he knows that like part of a debate or part of a conversation is about bringing out certain aspects of somebody's character it's about likability and I think it's easy for people who aren't already kind of hard lined atheists and who aren't already big doc and supporters to be like that guy seems mean well I think he is mean I disagree with you really I think I think he is a dick and I think he is mean and I think that's because he's had to deal with idiots over and over and over again and he's an extremely intelligent man and he's tired of it give me that and gets this quivering in his lips he talks to people you don't know that is not what's going on I guess so furious about defending defending the truth I I don't think he's a dick in in a unjust way yeah he's a dick for a reason he's a dick is he's a normal guy yeah I think he's also a dick because he's a normal guy with a lot of knowledge that doesn't have a lot of release in his life probably and he's also I think he's also sheltered a little bit because of the his position because of you know when you work in academia and you're kind of surrounded by like-minded people a lot and only periodically do you go out into the real world where there's a lot of people who don't have the education that you have and who have totally different values and belief systems I'm sure it can be really really frustrating because you're constantly having to defend a position that's the rationale posit that like anybody else who's come up through the ranks that you came up you know 97% of practicing scientists or something like that don't believe in God and maybe it's not that high but 97% definitely you know know that global warming is true and and maybe something like 75% in America don't believe in God but we're like a very religious country but when you kind of go through the motions and you just come to these logical conclusions because of all of the different life choices you've made but then you interact with people who are from such a different background who have never studied evolution who have never studied you know global climate change or whatever it's like talking to a wall sometimes because you almost can't have the same kind of reasonable conversations because when you're talking to somebody who's not coming from a rational evidence-based place who's coming from kind of appeals to emotion or who's coming from folklore or whatever reason they have to defend their kind of belief structure their faith position it's really frustrating because you don't really have a lot of ammunition at a certain point but especially when you're talking to somebody like gee pop Chopra who has like made a career kind of being good at debating who knows exactly the way to twist your words and to make it sound like what he's speaking is the truth and then he's got this like very benevolent kind of kind and calm demeanor and he's gonna make Dawkins look like a dick Oh see I didn't think that he did any any twisting in many words at all oh really no no I think you know he seemed like a wow peddler I mean to use your term he that's what he seems like but Dawkins was just getting so angry yeah and it's that old saying you know never argue with an idiot cuz people won't be able to tell who's who or that's not the saying I don't know it works for me I would never like I would never debate a creationist like people talk oh you should bah blah and I think like Bill Nye I don't know if it's happened yet but they'll nice supposed to debate Ken Ham that's insane I don't know why he's doing it I mean I I have friends you know I'm friends with Sean Carroll who's a physicist at Caltech and writes these really great books about about time and about quantum physics and he does periodically debate creationists and am i what are you doing such a bad idea you know like because these people are skilled just in the art of conversation they're skilled in the art of debate even if what they're saying has no weight they know how to argue these positions and try and trap you and get you on the defensive they have all of these different kind of skill sets but he always says it's not for me it's not to try and prove him wrong it's not to try and convince him not to believe in God you know like this guy is Ken Ham is like a hardcore fundamentalist Christian we're never gonna change his mind so they say the reason that we do these debates is for the people who are sitting there watching who may be like oh I don't know the difference between evolution and intelligent design I've never thought about it I've never really looked at the evidence that maybe even a small percentage of the people who decide to tune in will be given some sort of information that they didn't have before that they can be armed with to make better decisions but I don't know to me it just seems like I mean I think it's a noble pursuit but at the same time I'm not sure how effective it really is i bethe creationist I think I disagree with you I think it's I don't think you're gonna convince the creationist no not at all but I do think that there's there's value in someone who's good at it if someone has the ability to speak and speak well and also they have to have a certain amount of charisma they do absolutely the issue the Dawkins issue is that he gets so emotionally invested in this fucking horseshit that d-block spewing that he gets angry and furious instead of mocking him like there's a brilliant exchange with a there was a scientist or there was a panel and Deepak was on the panel and there's this scientist stepped up and ask Deepak a question and the Deepak clearly didn't know what the fuck he was talking about but the way the guy handled it was very sweet and it was smiling while he did it explained that he was in the process of writing a book with Stephen Hawking's mhm and then he was in the middle of this and then that I don't he's like I understand those words you said but I'm not sure if they mean anything yes the way said it was it was adorable like because the guy didn't lose his cool and it made Deepak look like a fucking idiot where is it the same guy got up and said you know what is this quantum talk you're talking a bunch of fucking bullshit and shut up and you don't know it then all of a sudden you're Deepak is this pudgy Indian man that you're picking on screams of racism another fucking hot buttons get pushed yeah I think the same thing can be done skillfully with these creationist fellows like sure I think the idea behind creationism is so preposterous in in the form that we see it in the form of you know not in the form of something created the universe whether it's some sort of a universal force that creates stars or the reason why atoms exist in the first place all these like fundamental questions that scientists have as to why the structure of the universe is what it is there's that but then there's this book that has been translated from other books and then they're sticking to this fucking crazy book just point out the other shit in the book that's ridiculous like the shit in the book about not being all aware two different types of cloth yeah and they do that usually they'll point out the shit in the book that's ridiculous and they figure out you know and point out how if the book says this you truly believe this in this century and science has unequivocally disproven what it is that you believe you know it's one thing to talk about like you said you know these big questions like what came before the Big Bang or you know what a lot of I feel like intelligent design advocates confuse for example evolution via natural selection with abiogenesis so they confuse the idea of how organisms have evolved over time with how life began in the first place which is a fundamentally different scientific question different topic totally different field of inquiry and so you know a lot of times what they do is they appeal to these two questions they say like well you don't know what existed before the Big Bang therefore God done mic drop you know every time and and instead of kind of allowing that it's to say you know okay neither of us know why is God the the first you know answer that you jump to let's look at all the other times when you're saying that the answer is God and we've disproven it over and over and over and over and just because we don't have all of the answers to every question right now using the scientific method doesn't mean that you know through new tools through new lines of inquiry that we might be able to answer those in the future it doesn't mean that like just because we don't have that doesn't mean that there aren't other philosophical answers to these questions that don't rely on this like very fundamentalist view I think personally that for example Bill Nye is gonna be able to hold his own he's a total badass he's not gonna lose his cool and Ken Ham if you've ever watched him in I mean he's a nutjob like he's a total of some videos oh he's a total nutter butter and he will lose his cool and he's totally not likable like nothing about this guy is likable so I think that maybe that's why Bill Nye was willing to do because I've seen Bill Nye right go on like Bill O'Reilly a million times and there's kind of a mutual respect there he deals with Bill O'Reilly very well and I'm always impressed to see the oneness Bill O'Reilly like the tide comes in yeah that comes out why does it do that yeah you can't explain that yeah he's with Steve with God yeah yeah I mean God's corner
