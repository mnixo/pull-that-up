four three two one boom and we're live Candice Owens how you doing I'm good how are you I'm very good thank you thank you for asking a lot of controversy these days Candice I guess but in the Twitterverse in the world just everybody's excited about being outraged yeah exactly that's exactly right there's controversy every five seconds you know I had a guy on before the guy that you just met dr. Robert Schoch he's a geologist from Boston University and he is a part of this backdating of the ancient history of Egypt and they're talking about you know all these different structures there might be thousands and thousands of years older than people think they are and one of the things that he's working on is that there was coronal mass ejections from the Sun somewhere around 10,000 years ago that basically killed off a giant percentage of the population on the planet lightning storms millions of times greater than anything we've ever experienced before that literally which like lightning coming down like rain barbecuing the ground killing people people forced in decay civilization resets it's almost like we need something like that don't really be upset about now instead of being upset about Roseanne or Samantha bee or Samantha bee use the c-word today that naughty guys it's just outraged culture yeah I say everyone should just wait like 48 hours if everybody hates you and then they'll be on to the next person that they have to eat yeah well that's one of the cool things about the Internet is the cycle boy it hits you hard but then it goes back pretty quick really fast yeah it's never that serious it's not like the old days when someone got in trouble with something boy that trouble stuck I don't know that time I'd I genuinely don't know that time how old you 29 it just turned 29 yeah so you're very very young in the shit-stirring culture yeah yeah this is all new stuff to you it's new yeah and I think the thing that sucks for me is that I'm really conscious of it like I wish I thought all of this was normal it would be easier but like even when I do things like just before this I was like oh let me do an Instagram story that I'm about to go on Joe Rogan I'm like hey guys like we own Joe Rogan and I'm like how weird I'm like holding my phone in the middle yeah talking to this device we sure we're of it that kind of sucks that I'm aware of it like it would be so much more natural if I wasn't aware of it you know girls that just hey guys and they all day and it feels normal so being conscious of it is kind of not that fun that's probably the best way to approach it does it be conscious of how goofy it is because if you're just swept away in the zeitgeist I don't know I think it's ignorance is really bliss you think yeah I think there are people that think it's the most normal thing in the world to just put your entire life on social media and I actually don't think it's the most normal thing in the world but my entire life is on social media well I've just met you but you seem like a very bright woman and that's probably part of the problem is you're not stupid if you're stupid you'd be like putting everything on Instagram and you'd be do you do the selfie face this is my favorite this thing I do I'm really bad at selfies my cousin always has to take them if we're in the same picture but I'm getting good at my like Instagram angle and like the things that I say like I'll do you guys like this I shadow like it's like it's it's that ridiculous my friend Cameron Haynes loves you he saw you on Fox News he's like who's this girl she's making so much sense he's like super hardcore conservative yeah so he likes when anyone is like young and conservative he like loves ben shapiro he loves all that shit yes got excited about you yeah people have been really excited I think it's just because I I'm I'm really unapologetically myself and today that's like it's like seeing an alien well it's hard to pull off right because people get mad at you people trying to that's this one thing that is absolutely happening whether people like it or not or believe it or not is that people are trying to silence other people's opinions if you say something that doesn't jive with them instead of saying wow this lady's kind of out there are she saying some shit that I'm not sure I agree with instead of that like fire you know what boycott boycott insane the outrage culture is insane it's like she really wants someone to lose their job she didn't like a tweet like how how weird are some of these situations I'm like you really this person not to be able to feed their family because you don't like a tweet people are crazy yes they find targets want to go after him there was a bunch of people that were writing boycott Joe Rogan because I was talking about having roseanne barr on the show tomorrow it's insane I know it's it's it's like she doesn't have a right to speak she can't even talk she can't even talk even though I'm sure you don't agree I don't agree with what she said right but the idea that she can't like have a conversation after that to me is like the most bizarre thing in the entire world but that is what outrage culture is yeah it's like they need you off the island he doesn't even agree with what she said right I know she apologizes nobody cares she's she's taken all kinds of antidepressants she's drinking she's fucked out of her head like my mom took ambien she just told me about this today I forgot I forgot about the story because I was telling her the story about another friend of mine on the podcast yesterday I talked about how a friend of mine got on ambien made a full meal cooked it ate it went to sleep got up in the morning and had zero recollection I was in total denial of it happens that's what my mom told me that she went to bed got up in the morning and she had gone up and put red lipstick and and a nail polish all over the white bathroom carpet she's painted on it like a child no ambi had zero recollection of it she's like this is scary shitless painted like a little kid would like a two-year-old would get ahold of your lipstick and start drawing on the wall she did that on the shag carpet ambien is just like sleepwalk like it instantly brings you into sleepwalk and you can do anything when you're on ambien I had a bunch of college friends used to do ambien and like bizarre stories would just come out I'm like very anti pill they don't take anything nothing nothing at all drink I don't drink I mean I wasn't always I just I kind of got I guess you could say it's like a little bit of paranoia but once I started down this like journey of realizing that like hold oh my god I lived for 26 years in my mind wasn't my own like I thought like being a liberal was okay and like everything that was said on TV it was okay then it's like very easy to sort of get a little paranoid and go okay well what else did I do I accept normally that is actually retrospective like a little weird and I started thinking about drinking and I'm like how can drink possibly be the cure to everything like it's like you're getting married drink happy you're sad drink right want to embarrass have some you know drink North might've shell drink like no matter what emotion you have there's like a liquor designed for it so I was like this is a little shady like I don't know I just feel like and I did like a little bit of math and I calculated that since I had charged drinking when I was like 14 years old and I would I would say like fair like I drink every weekend probably more in college maybe five days a week in college right then I was like wow I've technically drank for like three years of my life and that feels weird so I'm just not gonna drink any so you put in your time yeah take a little break yeah take a little break a little break yeah and which is weird because now I go places and oh my god I don't drink and everyone gets really uncomfortable and they're like oh okay I'll have a glass of water I'm like I'm an alcoholic you can have a beer and no but that's a weird way right like if other people are drinking you don't like yeah yeah they don't they don't trust you it's like it's like I just think I can't trust this yeah I'm like waters go whoever did weird shit it's like it's okay we're all hammered right but if one person so you don't memorize it right and shit down yeah and I'm at the age where all my friends are getting married and like the first thing they say when I say I don't drink it's like you're not gonna drink it my wedding I'm like whoa yeah is that okay like can I still come and like if they feel like you're ruining their wedding right because you're not gonna drink it's like a very strange thing the culture of drinking as a non drinker you really realize how bizarre it is socially I stopped drinking last November so it hasn't been like super long but long enough for people to really have some weird feelings about it and just some I'm just sober man I don't know it's not a bad thing yeah I took a month off I took a we did sober October no hot no booze and then we had to do 15 yeah 15 hot yoga classes 90-minute hot yoga classes in a month was this a bet between me and my four friends was it was a stupid bet cuz it wasn't even any stakes right like if one of us didn't do it we had to throw a party but we all did it so it was like pointless but we learned a lot learn a lot about just you learn a lot about that even if you don't think you use alcohol or pot as an escape you do you lean on it a little bit yeah and I always talk about like people are like what are the differences you've noticed and there have been so many differences but I think like the number one thing is just like the amount of confidence that I have like I have this theory now of that alcohol like gives you anxiety like I used to be stressed out like I realize that I was self diagnosing myself like I'm on a morning person I was probably just like perpetually hungover and never like now I have so much energy so I'm like wow I wonder how many things I've been like sighs like self-diagnosed thing I'm like oh yeah my skin just got bad once I turned 26 like skin immediately clears up so I'm like wow maybe I I just had like so much alcohol in my system that I like developed random things like it just got really wrong she says I mean it's definitely not good for it's certainly not good for you five six nights a week no and the best way to like stop drinking is to like read an article that freaks you out about like what drinking does like this is what I do is it's like how I train myself to do things I look read some really extreme thing on the internet and then be like okay no like like this guy had this theory that like alcohol and people call alcoholic spirits or whatever that like when you drink like it allows like evil spirits to come into your body like it's like I think the most bizarre thing and I was just like yeah I can't drink anymore gotta keep real spirits and that's what you used yeah yeah just like read weird articles and then I'm like am I gonna drink anymore I'm done I'm over it and then I realized like who else doesn't drink like the most like successful like Donald Trump has never drink alcohol which is just fascinating cuz I'm like I don't use a drink he's got so much energy right like he's just like going at it and I'm like maybe that's that's the secret charlie Kirk doesn't drink he's like 24 years old and taking over the world so I don't know I'm who else Don Trump jr. doesn't drink doesn't doesn't I mean he did like I used to drink I don't mean to but he doesn't drink yeah I don't know so I guess the people that I'm around now don't drink so it makes it easier but they're just like highly productive individuals and I'm now like highly productive Kim Kardashian doesn't drink and whether you like drink too good to be highly productive but it's also good to have fun and I don't think there's anything wrong with a little no I think there's nothing wrong with it people can drink around me all the time I don't care Oh actually I will say like when people get like completely sloshed it's a weird thing to observe when you're sober it's very it's it's a strange place it's like being on another planet we're like everyone's acting like a toddler it's like watching a preschool class yeah like I'm going to bathroom like you know I'm like why are you screaming close to my face they want to talk to you explain and they want to get really close like drinking makes you a really close talker there's something where you need to feel like the heat emanating off of someone's daughter's that space yeah just like you know people grab people and do weird shit to me it's a weird thing to watch sober there's a certain number of drinks where it's fun and then there's certain number of drinks who are like wow human beings are weird you know I think you're gonna go back I mean look I'm sure I'm not gonna like never drink again but like I'm not even I don't even think about it like it's just like this is the new Candice I'm sure like when I get married right like I'm not gonna not have like a glass of champagne but like right now like especially with like the stuff that I'm doing I'm like I just don't have the energy to be like tired right which is kind of a weird so how did you become this you're a very popular what I would call conservative thinker but you're very young like how did this all happen how did you become this Fox News personality conservative thinker yeah I mean I just like launched a YouTube channel and yeah YouTube where where magic happens a strange places it's the strangest strange place yeah it's the internet stream things happen on the internet but yeah I just kind of I was really passionate I understood I had studied for like it sounds strange but like I spent a year underground like studying politics once I had my red pill moment if that's what you want to explain that because you used to be a liberal right and then you became a conservative that's correct so what was it so the story like really starts with like high school I guess like they're you know how things can happen you in life they don't make sense when they happen you know like why god me and then let you get a little older and you're like this makes perfect sense right so I was the quote victim of a hate crime when I was in high school when you said quote unquote victim you know I hate the word victim and it's I'm like and again early I can see why early on I've sort of developed this mentality that like being a there's no value in being a victim and people rush to call people a victim they rush to call somebody to aggressor so how do you describe it that you experienced it experienced something that was labeled a hate crime I wouldn't even call it hate crime I think we live in a label obsessed culture and before we seek to understand what happened we seek to like put in a box yeah like someone has to be a demon someone has to be anymore so what happened was I received some voicemail messages from about four kids and that like you know the language was it was pretty strong it was like we're in a tar and feather your family we're gonna put a bolo the back your head we did to Martin Luther King like you know n-word n-word n-word and you received these on your phone my cell phone yeah how'd they get your phone number exact ranked phone call so I didn't know I was like four male voices and I was like in high school at the time and I was like okay I cannot think of for a human being is that want me dead that would say they've grown up put a bullet in the back of your head like we did to Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks like me come on school where we would part of the country Stanford High School in Connecticut okay that's a shithole yeah no I think it's on a shithole it's a running joke I'm sorry my buddy Tommy jr. he lives in Connecticut and I'm always telling dude you gotta move out of Connecticut and it became this terrible running joke where I talk about the Connecticut's the worst have you actually been has to work there all the time where what's it well I used to work in all over Connecticut when I was doing stand-up I would drive from Boston into Connecticut I did like a lot of gigs in Hartford I did Hartford is a shithole it's a shithole Bridgeport is a shithole shout out tomorrow and Starling jr. though yeah he was a boxer that came out of Hartford yeah a big time boxer Marlon Marlon Starling but when you were in high school right somebody started doing this prank call and shit on you and was this it was all in one night it was all money I was like four voice just tied to like a boyfriend it's always just a boyfriend's house when I got the calls and I just like put to silence it was like block number so I was like I didn't think anything of it and I'm like when I listen to it like it was like some pretty horrific stuff like I definitely cried you know I was 17 years old and then the next day at school I took this like philosophy class and like I don't know what the topic was I don't know what prompted me to raise my hand and like introduce what happened last night as like you know a segue maybe I just need to get off my chest but like the teacher like spazzed out and was like get up we're going to the principal's office like you know you have to report this he brings me into the office the principal like freaked out like she just like the language was like you know if it was shocking you know and then she called like the resource officer and then like the next period my life was like a blackout because it turned out that three of the kids I had never even met like they this was like maybe some kids that had their first beer one of the kids I was like friends with but we were arguing because he was upset that I was like spending so much time with my boyfriend but he's gay like he what it wasn't like he just was like jealous like you know like just like are you saying out from everyday so I hang out my boyfriend is a stupid thing ya know I he's a 100 percent okay from what I'm told but yeah so I just got petty yeah jealous and then was like yo right three friends and they were all gonna get drunk and call these call this black girl and you know it's easy to say awful things into like this life you don't have to look at a human being like it's easy to say awful things but unfortunately for me one of the people in the car happened to be the current governor of Connecticut son oh so this turned from like some kids prank called to like said some awful things to like front page of the newspaper throughout the entire state of Connecticut a little bit in New York and double-a-c-p outside of my school I have to it was like this situation that was talking about outrage culture my first like introduction to outrage culture and the things that sort of formed my thoughts like this was a very formative experience in my life which to me was it was nominal but it was like my life wasn't mine like I went from like sitting down watching I was watching Talladega Nights with my boyfriend to being the most discussed person in the state of Connecticut and what was interesting about it was just that because it was the governor of Connecticut son that was in this car they had to get the FBI involved to determine the authenticity of the look like maybe she called herself alright they he instead of just saying like yes it was my son he actually left the FBI investigate for six weeks and waited for her son to get arrested six weeks let you know what I mean like did his son deny it yeah I just want to see if I could get away with it if this is politics you know what I mean like can we get away with it is it possible for us to get away with it you know so six weeks of the entire state I didn't like left school people were like fighting on my behalf fighting left school yeah yeah it was it was just like yeah yeah this was just like it was like a Montross a-- t of a situation and it was one of those things where like literally like letters to the editor it'd be like moms like talk about you know outraged culture right like I don't believe Candice this happened this girl I believe she called herself like II like I'm just looking for attention one night and I just decided to say I was gonna hang my family from a tree isn't it funny that someone would even have an opinion on that it's it's bizarre I do not believe writes letters to the editor like the whole thing is weird retrospectively right like I don't believe her but that is what like life is about right exactly so it was the situation that like was just completely out of my control and then as quick as it happens got arrested and then as quickly that happened it was over for like everyone but not for me or these kids right like so I never one of these kids to get arrested like if no one like it this whole situation was taken out of my hands people thought I didn't go to the police like my teacher went to the police it turned into the zoo these kids were labeled publicly racists right the youngest kid in the car was 14 I'm not coming with ever labeling a 14 year old racist right or any of these kids racist these are kids and in my opinion adults that fail to act like adults and adults that fail to take a step back and say okay why would what would prompt these kids do this why is it so easy to be mean right why is it so easy nowadays for children to be mean and no one to me like when I really thought about that I went through like five years of like anorexia because of the situation because of that one yeah those yeah and yeah you went through anorexia yeah which is so weird now because like people that know me now look there's no way you never didn't eat but I did I did like did not eat for like five years I had issues with anorexia because I mean I don't see has a disease that genuinely is about control it's about a certain control of your life and I felt that I had my like my life was fine and then like people took the narrative I could decide what the term or the narrative was you're an you're your victim or maybe you're a liar you know you're these kids are racist these kids are this and just nobody really thought that like you actually ruined all of our lives right like for a little bit like these kids went on to have like duis and get arrested and got into drugs and it was because it was now pressure of everything that happened and I was like would have been totally cool with an apology like like sorry well good for you for looking at it that way and that's hard to do because everybody loves when they are allowed to get outraged everybody loves get outraged obviously what they did to you was horrible but I think a lot of kids especially if they're drinking they don't even understand how stupid and gross it is what they're doing they just know they can do it and they get a thrill out of it and then there's that mob mentality when there's like a bunch of people together doing the same thing exactly but up it starts saying crazy shit really understandable when you just like think about it as a human being and not as somebody who has to have opinion like you're like hey we're gonna call this black girl right you've got a bunch of kids we're gonna just say mean things to her on the phone and you don't have to look her in the face right it's like if I hold up this pen and I'm like just say mean stuff like someone's gonna get you could say anything to this pen so it's it's sort of it was a formative experience that in retrospect I understand has so much to do with why I am Who I am because I I hated that like that label obsessed culture and the outrage machine and then like okay we're done but like you know forget the people that whose lives we just like now do you know those people anymore I don't I know like the siblings of them because I was friends like that's a thing like one of the people that was involved I was very good friends with his brother and it's like you're just gonna tell me this kids like a racist like I actually knew the kid's mother you know like nobody cared it was the story weren't necessarily racist but they were just stupid and you mean shitty kids and they do that that was a way that they could scare you right you know like drunk maybe it was their first beer right but people could you hey well the youngest was 14 the youngest and this person was labeled a racist like that's to me is like that's harsh people say Oh forgive me I do not label them a racist because what they said was most certainly racist yes the words are racist right can somebody I guess the question is can somebody say something say a word that is racist and not be a racist human being yes I think no I'm gonna tell you why yes okay okay if somebody stand up I was watching I actually don't remember who it was like maybe it was louis c.k I don't know but he was saying how he like instantly turns into a racist like if somebody cuts him off and it's a good Chinese person like he's like instantly the first thing he says like something to do with him being Chinese right and there's a little bit of that in all of us like I was walking through New York City the other day and like a huge bus like just happened to like stop in front of me and like literally 45 Asians got off and suddenly I was just like I couldn't like walking around like oh I was like why do we Asians always travel in packs right like the most bizarre thing like I don't have an issue with them taking a bus and traveling and then afterwards I giggled I was like what's stupid being a stupid thoughts even had to have because I'm frustrated in a moment that I can't like get my bearings in New York City so yes I think that people in a moment of a frustration of anger if you add alcohol if you add ambien right and are coming from a place of upset they can just do something that's stupid without holding this like whole word for the rest of their what you're 14 your racism forever you're a race that's like yeah well especially today today nobody wants anybody to recover from anything that's right they want to know that you're you're dead yeah it's over your career is done your life is over the wrong thing I mean obviously there's some reasons for some people to be PI like Harvey Weinstein's perfect example that guy should be in jail of course for sure this is rapists yeah this is rape at least alleged rapists for sure he's done a lot of horrible correct but then there's people that like like what did Samantha bee say today oh yeah yeah exactly yeah what happens there thinks she gets in trouble I bet she doesn't she's not gonna get I bet she doesn't kiss is left-wing space to say sorry I'm mostly should the job at ESPN if they don't care there are fucking so many tweets that he put out that are crazy called Trump a Nazi and fuck you and think about like what people say about like ben Carson and black conservatives we ben Carson was literally called a porch monkey mm-hmm you know and that's totally fine he's black it doesn't matter they've like created no it was a famous person absolutely cause monkey person famous black person that's just that's like if I call guy Guinea yeah but it's but it's it's monkey is like a notic I don't care who it's coming from right like yeah but black people are allowed to say okay it's not okay none of it's okay the Uncle Tom's the we don't we stuff that we have laws or rules yeah culturally and I don't like those laws and rules here you yeah I agree it's definitely hypocritical like someone was saying that there's a tweet that i retweeted today that smallville girl that smallville show is still on the air and that girl is apparently she's admitted to sex trafficking in that some of it was her idea Smallville still on the air and they're pulling Roseanne from Hulu right Roseanne swear she did not know that lady was black right she swears she I mean she doesn't doesn't look very good if you don't aliceandmac says branding the sex slaves was her idea branding them that means like burning a logo into their bodies all right what is wrong with that I don't know enough about that story right but that bitch must be off the chart she's crazy yeah but it's it's only accepted like if you have any ties whatsoever to conservative thought if you have even like liked a tweet that shit out about it forget about it well I'm not even conservative but I have conservative people fucked and people call me all right and all this crazy shit they're just looking to silence and label right they're obsessed with me and I hate that the idea that you can't say something like they were literally I mean everyone piled in every celebrity on the Sun piled in and when I tweeted a couple of weeks ago and I was having a conversation I don't know if you saw this I was like I was having a conversation at lunch I just been observing Chelsea Handler I just think she's a weird person like I don't know what happened because I used to really like her like you know ten years ago that's when you were liberal yeah language well when she was I had her show like she was not politically correct I mean I don't know if anybody remembers the show Chelsea Lately yeah but she was making fun of everybody and now with the era of Trump she's like something's weird well she's getting older and I think she wants to be an activist now and I think she's looking for more meaning and importance because she doesn't have a family or children and I see that like I'm talking to like a friend at lunch I was and we were talking about like why some of these like older woman I have just gone bonkers and you know my friend made a comment she's like if you don't like use your eggs they scramble like just saying like these people that my friend said but I didn't even tweet that I didn't tweet that your friend should put that shit on t-shirt it's really funny if you don't use your eggs they scramble so I was like cracking up I know it's a but there's something there right it's it's there's something there it's not politically correct but I observe the pattern of Kathy Griffin I observe the pattern of Chelsea Handler and Sarah Silverman on the fence on his bad but in that neighborhood so I tweet out do you think there's something associated like between like woman who don't have children and they need something to nurture in foster and try to raise and in this sense it's society like they are just trying to parent the hell out of society and do you think sarah does Sarah goes back and forth she's she's more Norfolk she's like she's a kind person but there's something like once in a while sure I'm just like what like I did actually go back when I said you know what Sarah I shouldn't put you in the same category as Kathy and Chelsea but it's like this they're like obsessed with like everything trend they're completely wrong and educated about everything and yet they they think they can say whatever they want so I tweet this and I mean everyone was like you do like to believe that you like L like Ellen the Ellen show's producers like I'm Jake Tapper like delete the tweet I was like I'm not Jake Jake Tapper Toledo he said he said like this is literally so I tweet this has nothing to do with Trump anybody he's like this is the girl who like supports Trump and works for Turning Point USA which loves Trump I'm like what weirdest like logical jump to ever yeah and I just like I'm like Jake Jake stop yourself like come on so in the everyone was like to leave the two and I was just like how about what was the actual wording of the tweet I think my exact words were at lunch with a friend talking about like how bizarre Chelsea Handler Kathy Griffin and Sarah silver and so if Sarah Simon I just tweeted something like pro-ams 13 it was like the whole is really it was bizarre you know and how crazy they've gotten and then I I just said like do you think that something really happens women if they don't have you know children and that was just a question that's such a hot spot so you're going after a soft spot on don't say anything about like Sarah Huckabee Sander job should you can say anything to be Bunco you can say anything that's interesting there's anything to anybody to me right anyone that supports Trump it doesn't matter but then like these woman who literally go after these people like the amount of vitriol that Chelsea Handler has thrown to Ivanka you know to every single woman in the world Chrissy Teigen it's also like a not like she's just like angry like you know it's just like hate hate hate and then like you say one thing about them and like they like how could you even question how could you even ask the question if it's because they don't have kids and I'm like the fact that you guys so outraged makes me sort of think that you know point there yeah if you didn't have any point at all it wouldn't work that way this person she doesn't know what the fuck she's talking and I tweeted that I was like there's got to be something here you guys are all losing your minds you know okay so Sarah Silverman responded Kathy Griffin was like they went nuts this was like a full-on like Kathy Griffin is so happy someone's talking about her I know yeah but she's bizarre and they've gotten bizarre and at one point these people to me were funny and something sort of just happened and like Trump is the the means they whatever they're going through in life the outlet is Trump and anybody that likes Trump mmm well people think there's a cultural war going on there most certainly is it's official but you know so they feel like they're on a side and they have to you know they're gonna lob grenades right there in the war yeah and it gives people it also gives people a sense of purpose like that engaging in these twitter fights somehow or another is like reinforcing a good behavior and shutting down the bad behavior and I don't necessarily that I even if I don't agree with someone online I very rarely tweet about them I'm not I just I feel like I try at this stage of my life to avoid conflict as much as possible unless it comes to writing jokes sometimes some people gotta get they gotta take the hit I know usually when I go after someone like I'm at a phase in my life where it's all peace like I'm definitely a person that'll just say something but usually it's just in like that's what I thought I got you know it's thoughtful like and people were like back down or you can't like you know like yeah this morning or yesterday like Ben Shapiro and I got it's like a little spat and we actually like each other but like I was getting spat about I just I'm genuinely annoyed by his behavior online like I genuinely yeah I just find him to be like like and finally I like him like that's a thing as a bizarre is like I think people think there's much more like hate between us and there is it's like not it's just like genuinely like I really sweet something like dude shut up little like petty things that he throws that trumps sometime that are so unnecessary it's like like Kim Kardashian goes to you know get Alice Marie Johnson like she's been fighting for this for years she put all of her money into a legal team to do this like and that's not the only case she's been working on like actually trying to help these people get clemency and she takes a picture and he's like he says something just very Ben Shapiro he was like we should not be worshipping slut but I don't think he's worshipping us we're taking a meeting with congratu not worshiping a celebrity that's a little extreme of an analysis for a meeting and the picture is taken like me and I visited the president there's a full-time photographer and every person that meets the president you got a picture and though in the Oval Office it's like a part of the system and yeah so I was just like dude shut up like you know like I didn't say shut up I said like well he's got a good point in a way we really shouldn't be worshipping so for the sake of celebrity and especially reality show Celebrity I mean it doesn't mean that she couldn't have a very valid point about she wasn't like he I think he said something like we shouldn't allow celebrities to shape policy yet she wouldn't go there shape policy she literally had a case that she's been trying to get pardoned the only person that can do that happens to be President Donald Trump it's actually you know what she's trying to do is actually very honorable that's what I said and I said listen like she and she's been working on it for you she's actually into this now like she's into this like prison reform and I'm passionate about it like I grew up seeing my uncle's in prison so like for me the only time that I like snapback anyone is if it's something that I care about and obviously like I really am passionate about black America I'm really passionate about the changes that could happen for black America and prison reform or something I'm really passionate about so I've been observing like how hard your krishna's been working on this how hard Ivanka hasn't working on this and have really understood what they're trying to do like you know I went to the the prison reform summit a cup-like you know a month ago and and Kim in this she doesn't even like agree with Trump on a lot of stuff she's thrown you know some sheet at him but this is something this Alice Marie Johnson case she was doing before Trump got into office know what I love about the picture her in him what she's like way the fuck over here but she she cares about just the case but look how far away she is from him I will say it is awkward though cuz his desk is a lot lower than you then you realize that's actually a little closer than I like stands up straight like she's standing or like Bend like I bent when I was in there which is also kind of weird too so it's like you see people who either like this or they're like this and there's no one between we could do like 1950s movie star picture like this yeah exactly I should that's what I should have done yeah she's closer than I thought she was I felt like maybe I put it in my own head Jax was pretty goddamn good right there she's gorgeous but she doesn't look anything like she used to look but yeah whoever did that nobody does nowadays mister surgeon you did some fun she's plump yeah good looks good yeah but I guess the question is the kind of celebrity do a good act you know and sure yeah of course the answer is yes well I mean that's that's what Chelsea Handler's to do I mean that's like she's donating but she really is she donated a million dollars to Puerto Rico which is good yeah that's good that should be celebrated that's what she's trying to do with all of her money now she doesn't even give a fuck about like which is your agency which is good all of that stuff like when they do stuff like that it's great and it's honorable but like the stuff that I hate that celebrities do and what I which I differentiate from and I guess this confuses people is when they just give their opinion like we you know at like at the Emmys and they're on stage just like teaching all of us about how wrong you know our opinions are it's like I don't need to celebrity grandstanding like you know you know if there's an issue you care about other than the fact that people disagree with you then sure do that if you care about like Ashton Kutcher going after sex trafficking celebrate that that's cool like Kim Kardashian going over after crime jesters perform celebrate that that's cool but when you get these celebrities that just get up there and try to deliver a tear it's like shut up literally nobody cares what you think like this well they care enough that that person's got that platform and they feel like this is their opportunity to say something significant and also like they're for sure 100% virtue signaling yeah 100% letting everybody know how moral and ethical they are even if they are I mean this is just those fucking award shows are weird to share weird it's weird you should go up there and you should say thank you thanks a lot guys thank you thank you to the man upstairs Thank You Odin Thor used to do that yeah they used to say couple of names of producers come up with little piece of paper and then they should always thank the man upstairs and they used to go down now they have like like the face and the emotion you know Marlon motherfucking Brando really yeah in between having sex with everyone Marlon Brando apparently fucked Richard Pryor he who knows he fuck he's fucked a bunch of different people I brought you guys a must-do yeah was one Marvin am I making that up it was said it was Marvin Gaye but it's been oh it's definitely there Pryor's wife admitted it which is to me is a huge prior fans that was a spike through the heart fuck anything in quotes yeah I bet he would if you fucked Richard Pryor I mean what the hell yeah he's he started this so he started this because when he won the Academy Award for I want to say was Apocalypse Now he had a Native American guy go onstage and take it in this place to highlight the plight of Native Americans maybe was a different movie but it was it became his big political speech Marlon Brando was crazy yeah The Godfather thank you so he had this guy go up and and and accept the award in his place and give some speech his woman okay this event just became like a culture of like trying to one-up each other that what's going on really was him it's unbearable you know it's just like a log yeah I can't stand it it drives me insane that's a huge difference that doesn't mean that I think that celebrities can't do good in the world it's just that like that this celebrity grandstanding give me some volume on those tiny bearable you get Roger Moore looking all good I also this woman hold on go back to modern Brando The Godfather and so now this little feather my name's a little feather holy shit look at look at them they're like we can't say shit even back then nobody knew what to do like she's hot as far she's really pretty and he has asked me to tell you in a very long speech which I cannot share with you presently because of time but I will be glad to share with the press afterwards I'm like really really grateful I cannot accept this very generous award and the reasons for this being are the treatment of American Indians today by the film industry excuse me [Music] these are booing some are clapping and on television in movie reruns and also with recent happenings at Wounded Knee I beg at this time that I have not intruded upon this evening and that we will in the future our hearts and our understandings meet was wounded me pause for a second isn't that what was going on just a this isn't at the same place where a couple years ago well no that wasn't Wounded Knee what was that Standing Rock yeah yeah standing wow I did not know that like this is have you had Wow this is where it all began house have been people have just been trying to one-up each other maybe one like she like one yeah yeah she she came in around the perfect time she's like yes NBC wrote this is our president right I was like what it tweeted it it's insane it's like they're not even pretending which I appreciate now they're not pretending to be the news anymore like you know they're just like we hate Trump and we are the propaganda machine that will tell you you know it wasn't beasts like Twitter it was just the NBC Twitter it said something like it was amazing I was just like wow yeah wow and then everyone was like out it was like the opposite of outrage culture which I don't even know what it is Brian run run you have to run because like gave a speech the woman we won't use the secret and dr. oz it's just like I can't take anything seriously anymore so well there's things to be taken seriously but celebrities probably are on that list yeah spiros right yeah no well he's right about this you know but he was like trying to correlate like what Kim did like with Alice Marie Johnson looked like that and I'm like come on man that's like totally different and just in general like sometimes she just gets a little like hall monitor for me like you know like it's just like you know he can't help himself I know he's a funny guy yeah it's very snarky like him along I like him too that's the thing it's like people we actually really get along but like the hall monitor I know these types in school I was in their classes you know like they're just like you're like late to school like the last person you want to see it like the hall monitor like you know like really the idea that she would be late right yeah like bench just give me the pink slip dude scares me been alright like right like you know this is a gateway to Saturday school like it's just like it's a good impression of him saying sometimes yeah I can't do that how do you do that how do you do that I can't do that and he's doing it sober he's not like some dudes who do that they're all adderall DUP you know he's on the natch yeah I like I liked these kids in school I just be like you know I was just the kid that was just like kind of like more chill and I don't need to like and sometimes and he just goes over stupid stuff it's like but I do wonder like if he's learning anymore that's the one thing like like yeah cuz I he doesn't like to have like it's like once he has an opinion like I like to be like to have conversations and I like to be wrong about the conversation because I don't know everything I think that's kind of like why people love this podcast so much because you're open to learning anything like it'll have people on this podcast you're like what is he having you know because there's something there's always something that you can learn there's always something that you don't understand that you don't know if you have an open mind if you have an open mind right and I think that in in many ways and that like sometimes he's just not open to learning about certain things and then somebody might know something about a culture beyond what he knows and it's just like nope that like the idea like it's just Ben is really fucking smart and that's the problem what's the problem exactly you know I hate it like I got so annoyed with like the the Kanye West like four seconds to the greatest article saying Kanye West is just crazy and I'm like who did this baby yeah and I wrote him an email I was just like dude like I understand that to you and the way that you've done your life this doesn't make sense right but this is actually really important for black people to see the continent it was the most important which thing was it him like you know him tweeting out I love waking some things but beyond that saying that he openly supported the president so I can see why been shot something like that down initially because to him like culture is not the way you talk about politics right like because he's by the book but he has to understand that by the book is not the way people in the hood are being raised by the book is not the way people in the projects are being raised people have had their families destroyed and decimated by the welfare system right the fathers aren't even at the homes you know the single motherhood rate jumped from 25% nineteen sixty-five to seventy four percent today and so these kids turn to culture to father them they turn to jay-z and Beyonce and hip-hop and Kanye and to tell them what's right and what's wrong so for so long because the left has had a stranglehold on culture they've had a stranglehold on black America so the most significant thing that opened up this dialogue beyond the work that I was doing was this like simple tweet and this simple show of support from Kanye West and I was so frustrated that he had to he had to like in that moment just write like dismiss him as crazy it's just like dude like just be willing to learn like you know just people willing to say like I don't understand why the hell this is the way that this is people willing to talk about politics right but maybe there's something here and I always understood that culture was the most important vertical when Charlie and I first met and we sat down I defined three voted on Charlie Charlie met him a couple times Charlie Carroll truck okay so Charlie Kirk is like this 18 year old like we started turning point USA who I work for when he was 18 and he is like a savant they call him like Trump's Boy Wonder like he's a brilliant if you mean you want to talk about like smart beyond I get the smartest person I know is Charlie cracker hands down and he's only 24 he didn't he didn't go to college just like I don't know just like he was reading weird stuff when he was seven you know I don't know I just like things that everyone's like oh yeah I just read that Tom is so he's like yes I read it when I was six you know why could you not say that could you be cool but so when Charlie and I met and I like I told him like my plan to sort of help black America and to wake them up because I understood how we had fallen victims of his brainwash it was what brainwash is that the leftist Dogma there's this idea that because we're black we have to vote Democrat anyway that is not a Democrat resis tanned against helping us that is like what so many black Americans believe I believed it I believed it you know what I mean so and I'm a pretty smart girl you know I've always been a very smart girl though I've always been you know I've excelled in academics right so how did I fall victim to it the exact same system right these three verticals the first being the family the breakdown of the family the second one being culture which then to me like growing up it was like jay-z like jay-z was God to me like I like would throw on like I was you know I went through a lot of stuff when I was a kid I didn't have a great family you know but I would throw on a jay-z album and like whatever he said was like it was like going to church you know and then and I can't seen him now but the third one oh no because he he knows exactly what he's doing and he's a traitor but the third vertical being education which was what casual aside he's a traitor yeah it's like like Beyonce because he knows what's happening to black America and he's somebody that built his entire career off the backs of black America you know of being the guy who started in the hooding in you know Queens and worked at you know was a drug-dealing worked his way up and it became the idol for some people in black America and then he stands on stage and endorses Hillary Clinton he stands on stage and tells black American to put the same people in in the White House that locked up more black men than any present history of United States Bill Clinton right the person that stands on the crime bill of 94 is Bill Clinton but because jay-z is now focused on getting a piece of the pie the globalist piece of the pie he doesn't care about black America that's that's my opinion so why I think that's what it was or do you think that maybe he thought that Donald Trump represented a lot of races why people know he doesn't want that oh not even kind of not for a single second because jay-z's very smart did you speak to him no I didn't speak to him I just I know like it's there's a certain thing where like I just I know that jay-z Beyonce betrayed the black community like that they also you think they did it purposely for financial gain yeah I think yeah I think that they they were interested in having they want to be the people that control the world and they felt that Hillary Clinton like you know they were working with Obama very closely and very clearly now we know that the Obama administration worked very hard to get Hillary Clinton to office and they wanted to stay in that group and so they supported Hillary Clinton who was selected behind closed doors forget the American people the next president United States yeah so it's elected certainly by the DNC yeah 100 percent beyond that it was in bed with Obama you know she was our Secretary of State and she she was doing deals behind closed doors and jay-z and Beyonce were part of that clique right no they were a part of the celebrated celebrities that were allowed to go to the White House and they'd wear the ties and everybody would be taking photo op but it was a cool thing to be friends with Obama right like nobody wants to go to the White House and and like celebrities it's hard to get celebrities to go with Trump there's so much controversy attached to it I think your career look a brochure display part of left and right part of what's happening with roseanne is not just that she made a racist tweet no she didn't know was really supports Trump and and she her character supports trafficked and people were looking for something to hate her over and she handed it to them you know well it's just you you know you stick your neck out in that way and you're just people on the left for sure look at anyone who's a trump supporter is an open target even if they're a reasonable person even if they're a person who's kind and and measured and and and very I've been nicest person I think I've ever met is about the Trump you know and she's like never responds never punches back and and look what they treat her well that's how Samantha bee did it but yeah other people have gone after to all the time ago after Ivanka and like she's like such a kind person but it's just because like her father is Donald Trump so it's open season and it's it's that's what that's why Jake Tapper jumps into a tweet about Chelsea Handler and tries to correlate Trump it's like they're obsessed with people that like Trump I like Trump I don't know what to say I like the guy I think Jake Tapper on the news the day of the election we did a comedy we did a podcast from The Comedy Store we call it the end of the world podcast but a bunch of people because well whoever the fuck wins the end of the world we have this live podcast and I went into the the greenroom afterwards to the comedian's bar and Jake Tapper was on TV and he was so bummed out and I took a photo of him like him on the screen you just like yeah like the sadness I remember his face he was he was really sad he was sad you see you find it it's oh my god it's really so I think my sister never said the best like like he spliced together like all the clips of just like he was exceptional the news anchors and the emotion that was coming out of them he did some like crazy thing is all of them that said he'll never win I know never where and now we have that never yeah you know it's forever they laughed they laughed ever there's a moment where like Ann Coulter they said so who do you have winning and she says Donald Trump and they broke into laughter like the cool kids yeah it's the cool kids at the at the lunch table and that's really how they've been acting like they're not interested they think that they're cool kids at the lunch table and they get to define what's cool and there they're just having a rude awakening right now and it's beautiful to watch I love it everybody loves an upset too yeah people love and upset and then they also once their team gets in then they want to support their team so they fucked up by making it tribal it really did because you know tribal right versus left people go we'll fuck these guys fuck Jake or I'm going on this side that's my team now generally it's like it's like team sports fanatics right now it doesn't even matter like there's a little sense anymore it's just like this is the team that I've pledged my life to a part about his ego like you just spent how many months calling everybody racist sexist deplorable are you really gonna go yeah you know what I was wrong they have to hold on to something right and I see that because like you know when I went to this prison reform summit Van Jones was there and and Donald Trump is speaking in it it was like love between them it was love but really this is the guy that said white lash you know right after the election and he you know but how can he go back from that it's very hard to you know pedal backward from that so half of them are fake in my opinion I find them to be fake because I've seen them behind closed door they don't feel that animosity for the president cuz it's hard to he's really likable I mean like his presence when you meet him he's very aware of himself he's aware of the jokes that are being made about him he'll make the jokes about himself yeah he's he's likable he's got these just has something about him what about like when he makes a tweet a Memorial Day saying that the dead soldiers would be really happy to know how the economy is doing and how you know black unemployment sits low as it's ever been like that shit was ridiculous I actually missed that sweetie I'm just laughing is I every time someone says it Trump's me I just like I laughs I just think it's funny well I wrote that he put the me in Memorial we're going a different direction like I predicted 2020 like he's not gonna go on seed and he's gonna like be here like it's like he just wants to talk him and its really hard it's really hard for these people to speak because what happens is they go on to a stage and the room they love him like right everyone loves him because he's really likable you can't be in a room with Trump and not laugh and like him but makes Cooper's wearing out his fingers right now I know I know but then they take away the clips and then they spice it up and they make it like he said something bad but what they're doing is it's it's a terrible game to play because you're not just lying on Trump you're lying on 50,000 people you know the thousands of people that are there hear him speak right like so they're playing a game where then those people get pissed off with me you think they're playing a game where they're they're misinterpreting the things that he said he said plenty of shit like for example when that like that that moment when he says oh if this was the old days we'd take you we take you out to the back like you know do you remember that moment when he said while he was running and somebody was you know causing a circus in the crowd and like oh he's like get him out of here and then the way they ran it right like oh like when in the old days when they used to like you know hang black people from trees look at what what I think he literally meant that you used to be able to get your yeah that's how they spin it and that is same thing like when he said to Bucky well what do you have to lose prior to that he had listed every stat where quite low do you got any but you lose here you know but then they get that clip they're like Oh Trump is insulting black America he's saying that they all live in know he's saying no statistically speaking if you look at the people that live in the projects that are in poverty it is black America so he's asking the the current that the past administrations have not been serving you what do you had to lose so it frustrates me because it's like you see that that they mix it up and they try to divide the country but at the end of the day unfortunately for them he's actually really likeable and same for Don Trump jr. like I mean they're they're really funny they're really likeable and they're aware of themselves like they're in on the joke guys like well Jamie was telling me the other day that they made some video what was the video that they made see if we can find that video was really funny where they're all mocking themselves about that what was it about Laurel and yeah yeah yeah two words I actually haven't even heard the word that everyone was I haven't either I might fuck you I'm not paying attention stupid shit I will not listen to her just would literally don't but yeah they made fun of themselves yeah let's see it we'll play it Kelly and Conway was the best give it to us from the beginning young Jamie that's a different one the news put it up so I get the real one they put okay okay thanks it's it's hilarious that they have I mean this is this is actually a very clever thing to do because they but they're all like that like Ivanka like they're all aware of the joke you got ad blocker on clever bastard it's Laurel but I could deflect and divert to you Annie if you need me to do that probably chill winner reported that you here well how do you respond clearly you're getting your information from CNN because that's fake news all I hear is yawning oh man that's Laurel oh stop this what is well here's something going on today the things messing up what is messing up the this TriCaster yeah we got to do that thing we were talking about and fix that anyway it's just the idea is that these people had the sense of humor and then with the Trump at the end he's doing what is he saying yeah that's the thing is they're like like they under in on the joke and I think that people don't realize like how in on the joke they are like they're like he's aware that you say all this off about the fact that he tweets out and says all of this stuff right like like Don Trump jr. is aware like that he's a billionaire son and that's what people say oh you're a billionaire son like they're so funny and that it's sad that people don't get to see that side so I actually do hope that they all come on this show because it's people should actually see how hilarious they are and how aware of themselves they're like the most to me in my opinion the most likable relatable first family of my lifetime like you know I can't speak to anyone there so you didn't think that Obama and Michelle were likable or relatable not know oh my god you don't think he's likable guy just you know what's funny I was at a dinner last night with people that came over from Cuba and this woman said that when she first heard Obama speak and she was she was you know way older she broke down crying because it reminded her the first time she read Fidel Castro which is a bizarre thing to say right guy was just like what I don't know anything I've never been to Cuba and they got scared that America was going to turn into a communist country it was with a bunch of Cubans yeah crazy right like they literally came out of their mouths but my PTSD but what they know but what they say could be it could be but what they were saying was like the veneer of it all like like you know that it was like exactly what you wanted to hear Obama said and the perfect and the perfect tone with the perfect hand mannerism with you know what the I don't know the perfect inflection in his voice and there's something about that to me like especially the person that I am that just was super inauthentic and I'm not saying by the way Obama won in 2008 I cried like the let's let's let's let me not be fake here like I was like like he's black I'm black everything's gonna be great you know but you know as things went on and I was watching him it just everything seems so fake and he wasn't really doing anything so I just don't respond to that sort of a personality I like that authentic and I think that's why Trump coming in behind him was so relatable as a president like there's this theory and it's a good one by tamerica Ron that why do you like revolution to take place unexpectedly you could argue that right now America is having a revolution it's we're not out there shooting each other but there's an ideological revolution a cultural war if you want to call it that's taking place and too many people this seems unexpected right we Abama was in office and then like whoa what Donald Trump you know and the theory is that when you're when the public and the private of an individual our personas get too far apart a natural revolution takes place and society really has just been so fake I mean like everything offends you everywhere you go people get offended up people's hair like literally Kardashian's will put their hair in braids and the whole internet will explode saying that they need to pay tribute to Africa like it's a crazy I'm like I have never in my life looked at someone's hair and felt emotionally I'm just like whatever you're doing your hair is fine with me like if you took the time to do it it's fine with me but the idea is that as a culture we've become so fake I think that's fake I think this is people just looking and getting angry at things I think it's particularly the braids thing it's fake its fake it's 100 there's no person that can tell me that like the first time they saw a braid on someone's hair it upset but then somebody told me that they should be upset but like privately when they're at home you think they get upset when they're watching TV yes I think they do I think there's some people that get upset at a lot of stupid shit I just don't think I don't think they're inauthentic with their their being upset I just think their focus and their anger is just misguided and and dumb yeah maybe maybe it's the dumb part maybe it's just when it gets dumb dumb with hoop earrings it's like crazy like bantu braids you need to pay tribute to the island of Jamaica I'm like first off like you've got to be a really inspired person to even look up why you're offended like that takes a lot of research like I was researching like who started the bantu knots like who's who started the cornrow I'm like you've got a lot of time on your hands like for me personally like if I could just not have to research why I'm offended a little more time ass ejections boom power grid goes down lightning storms and a million times greater than anything and we wouldn't be worrying about braids anymore I know it's too easy it's too easy she delivers no wolves in the street there's no humor you know and that's another thing it's like especially like you former stand-up comedian right in the current you still what do you torrent and you do comedy okay so I don't speak just having conversations with the crowd people love to talk to you that's that's tiresome yeah thing is like how is it difficult when you're standing you can't say anything anymore like five seconds you're holding me over you can you just have to legitimately not give a fuck right and have a bunch of good friends that you really love and you you know you surround yourself with loving people and y'all support each other yeah that's what I do people don't realize I think they don't realize how little I care about their outrage I always say to myself I wonder if they knew how little I cared if they actually write the article like if they actually knew how little I get when you care a little are you still talking about Jake Tapper and fascinated by it I'm fastest look at Jake Tapper is like a day where they all were just a car and then like the next day its fists right now it's over yeah yeah the next day it was over like you know like just now it's like Ben Shapiro it's like no one care I don't care I don't Ben doesn't care like I don't like it we're gonna see each other in one week like in two weeks in Texas we're doing an event together like I see them all the time and I like them but like to everyone else they're weighing in it's like it's like so this is your business though this is you're in the business of politics now no this is what I want to get to how do you go from being a liberal who cried when Obama was elected he's black on black yeah how do you go from that to being miss conservative poster girl in 2018 because that's what you are ten years later I guess yeah no you are like a lot of people that are conservative they love the fact that you're attractive you're smart you're articulate you're black and you you're fucking forceful with your thoughts and ideas and you push them through quick and right you're not scared of pissing people off and this is very exciting to conservative people that are on the sidelines like yeah it's like we got a fucking great running back you know we're gonna win the Super Bowl this year like that's how they look at you you're you're like a great soldier in the field that's how people look at it that's fine you know I appreciate that so how do you go from that what happened so two things so to reconcile what happened to me in high school right after two things I wanted to do that I wanted to correct the world I guess I wanted to correct what had happened to me so the first thing was I launched a website blog for young girls that were going through things I had gotten out of the eating disorder and I wanted to just give girls that may be going through something a way to write right so I do they build this blog we do be 180 I tell make him write whatever they want that was the first thing the second thing I wanted to do was to combat like I felt and I still feel in my soul that children today are growing up in a time that we people can't don't even stop to think about we have ten year olds that are killing themselves over snapchat like if someone puts picture of us after and they kill themselves like a you know and no one has really like thought about how much technology has negatively impacted the ability for a child to grow up right but they're concerned about the way they look like I used to babysit a and to put myself through some years of college and nanny for these kids they're so they care about how they look when I was 10 like I like I didn't care how I looked I didn't even know how I looked I you know it's I definitely did not seen the pictures right so so and now we have Kazuko Joe so the second thing I wanted to do is I said I have this great idea that I'm gonna build this and this is this is the the the social autopsy bit that the youtubers were freaking out about they thought that it was a political machine and it was going to be to help children I found out where this would it was never launched it was an idea that I had to build something that would be like screenshots of what people said online and like to put them in like a timeout so I literally were going around we were meeting with high school like high schools and saying like we're thinking about building something for children that like so instead of going to prison because you sent a mean tweet or a means snap like what if you just couldn't like try out for the football team you know what I mean like what if like your teachers to check the database to see like how you were behaving online was it like naive going back like it sure like I did but the idea that the the feedback that we were getting from principals was like first try on adults because like if this goes awry like to do this for children it's like not going to be a great idea so I started Kickstarter saying that I'm raising money for this project to help you know combat online bullying like it was like a project that was so from the heart it was just like trying to rectify the wrongs that I felt were done for these kids that aggressed me you know in high school and instead I end up in the middle of a firestorm again unbelievable I was like God really gamergate scandal like they do you know about this I'm you've spoken to my right I knew nothing about it I wasn't a gamer I wasn't in line I wasn't in politics nothing about it but I put this Kickstarter up saying like what we're doing is figuratively lifting the masks off of trolls and the internet lost its mind it lost its mind and a girl named Zoe Quinn who was patient one of the gamergate scandal calls me and at this point she was working for Twitter as the official anti harassment of Twitter and she basically threatens me and tells me to kill the project and I had no idea at the bread and butter of the gamergate scandal she called you on the show called me on the phone she contacted me via Twitter and words that you're saying first she started off with like I'm the girl that was the victim of gamergate instantly to me it was off people don't wear victim like a badge like I knew this because I had gone for this in high school and she was like I'm telling you why I need to kill your project immediately because there are people you know there are that harassed me and they will harass you if they find out about it I'm trying to save you like you know and I was kind of like you know I appreciate sudden tip like no thank you and then she got like you know increasingly like you have to kill this project and then she started crying it was like very bizarre phone call I'm super confused so your project was to take the masks off troll figuratively we'd never had built the technology we'd never like what we were saying like what we were gonna literally do was archive okay Facebook messages okay cuz kids on the internet will say mean shit being ruthless yeah find their messages yeah why did she have an issue with this understand my Kickstarter said I guess I said a word that made them think that we were going to be able to unmask Twitter trolls like a totally something that we had never even thought of that literally like that we were gonna be able to like their name is well now I'm gonna be like that's Joe Rogan no like this we did not build this this is like crazy like we'd literally horribly be a better place if everybody did happen I know I actually not opposed to that but we weren't building it you know that why was she opposed to it that's why I'm so cool you know it's bread and butter the gamergate scandal is that people say she harassed herself okay I didn't know this I just hung up the phone with her yeah I hung up the phone with her and she was like if you go through with this project her these were her last words you're gonna ruin everything crying it hangs up the phone I was like what a week like so you're saying that people think this is always the gamergate that she harassed herself in order to get a ten left media helped her and launched like a thousand charities like all of these girls harassed themselves this is like literally why my know some people have definitely harassed himself yes and the whole she was the first person that this like started with and every one of these gamers like mind you I'm not a gamer I'm just telling you the two sides that I walked into I didn't know so I hung up the phone with her and I sent a tweet that was like don't know who Zoe Quinn is I can tell you this girl has never been harassed and the world breaks okay but see but what I was gonna say my finish my sentence I know some people have harassed themselves they faked it but way more people have actually been harassed I'm sure I'm just saying that her in particular so you say by talking her she's never been her I do die I know everyone like I'm telling you victims don't wait like you would never like be like I'm the victim of like it's something that you there's you do that that's the story so I hang up the phone with her I tweet this right within one hour we start getting inundated just like she said she said if you don't kill the project mean Trump supporters are gonna come after you and start harassing you like literally like we're getting like inundated with emails that say like Bob at Trump 45 calm and they're like died and we're die like if you go through it like we're gonna kill like just like the most like I was like well this is kind of perfect right like you warned me and then it happens like within an hour we had had no messages nothing and then all of a sudden I was full-on like and I was like no no no sweetheart you did this like you orchestrated this and she had been accused of doing this like five times it wasn't like Milo and Breitbart were just covering all of the instances that people have accused her of like she calls them and then they get harassed she calls them and they get harassed and I didn't give it I had no horse in the race I don't care about you know gamers respectfully I don't game right I didn't care about politics you know respectfully at that time I wasn't politicking I just had a phone call with a girl it was a little weird phone call and then I suddenly I was getting in dated with emails and I were just making youtube videos at the time no I was literally like fully doing this degree when anything and I was gonna really try to build this high school like this thing to help kids then everyone says you Doc's minors like literally like we were building this platform so that children would never have to be like get in serious trouble for doing stupid stuff like via technology ever how did she get your contr she messaged me I gave it to her she messaged me on Twitter like she was like burnt witch or something at you and I I liked it literally her hand was burnt rich and like at that time I wasn't even like on Twitter like I had just made a Twitter profile and I see someone that has a check mark and it says like official whatever handle of Twitter so what seems more official than like a check mark and right so I was like here's my number call me would love to chat like you know like so you just thought you're gonna have a conversation with someone that may be a partner with me because I'm like oh this girl's been harassed on the internet like maybe she'll like want to help kids like yeah you know like right Alice in Wonderland like it totally like insane Alice in Wonderland's and then like all of a sudden there's like a Cheshire Cat who's like smoking so you think that someone orchestrated this attack was fake Trump supporters that were going after you was not yeah that was my like I was like oh how can he we've been on Kickstarter for three days and no one has harassed us you call me and tell me kill the project or I'm gonna get her ass hang up the phone with you an hour later we're getting inundated harassment and she was saying that you were gonna get harassed by Trump supporters well she said she didn't say Trump supporters all of their addresses happen to be like you know like Trump 45 that Jean like whatever it was like they would they would actually have like weird porn handles I got like weird handles you know I still have them I would have to pull it up why did she think that someone was gonna harass you this I'm still confused she was unmasked role and that's what she said like when the gamergate people at these these anonymous men who were harassing both the people that harassed me when they see what you're working on they're gonna they're gonna freak out you can't do it they've ruined my lives you know she's and then she started saying you're gonna get doxxed they're gonna find out where your parent lives and like literally after that someone sent me like a map and they had doxxed my family like my grandmother's like where she lives my grandfather like it was just like look what she's what she said was gonna happen after you contacting her so you think that she did I know she did it like I've said this a thousand times the second I said it all of a sudden the New York magazine and Washington Post tried to smear me instantly instantly you know at that time I know this it's not it's implausible with the time frame of getting no nobody messaging me right to her calling me all of this flooding in and then the New York magazine I was a girl on Kickstarter why the hell is the Washington Post calling me after I tweet this girl harassed herself The Washington Post New York magazine the usual suspects right like like now the usual so I say that's how I was like oh great The Washington Post I was like totally an idiot you know we're rushing to say like Candice got confused like it's it's been a long time Internet conspiracy as though he couldn't harassed herself and Candice got sucked in I'm like I don't even know what gamergate is I don't know who I don't even know this article now had no idea that there was accusations that she had ever been harassed gut instinct one instinct and I got in the middle of a cultural war and people were like get in touch with Nero I'm a fuckin eros Milo you're not there to the time okay just like you know like you just like landed and then people that I thought were white nationalists which was like Breitbart was the only publication that was like just telling the truth that was happening like just saying like this girl jumped on cakes are like she's know like pulling no leg in this race non-political or not and like this is what she says happened so it was just it was a very bizarre situation but it changed my life because the people that I would have thought in that moment would have like come after me and said awful things about me or said like were the people that were very kind like you know at that time I would have said I was a liberal you know I would have said like you know I supported me Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton you know whatever it was you know I wasn't politically active and people that were like reaching down and just being kind were like Mike Serna bitch who if I googled his name said it was he was like a white supremacist so it just was like a weird thing like my whole life just went you like I was like okay so one interaction that's all it took it's yeah and a subsequent firestorm no is there ever been any proof at all that she's done what you think she did just a bunch of people saying the same thing that had nothing to with one another in different situations and the media refusing to - well it's like one of those blame-the-victim things nobody wants to take a chance unless there's just overwhelming and she never responds like I've said it out a thousand things like she harassed her like she never responds and I stick by that I'll never veer from that and it was but I always say that was that was my moment like this this project that I had never even built out that changed everything I stopped the project and I you know subsequently just wanted to learn the guy just like is it possible that I got to 26 years old and have everything wrong about people that I thought you know I was just believing in the background you know that anybody that CNN said this one interaction with one person that may or may not be deceptive why would that make you switch political affairs I wasn't it was even switching I wasn't politically active I just like if you had asked me I would have said I wasn't you know what I'm saying like I was never I was never a girl like wearing a pussy head outside like that's something people understand if we just know God if pressed I now that I if you think of like where I'm at now and talking about how I hate labels I was probably already a conservative but I didn't give a shit about politics I had a hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt and I was just trying to pay back that's it that was my whole life there was nothing about politics but at that moment it made me it was forced to me to consider my political affiliations because I had me saying this I'm saying like you know the New York Magazine like tried to smear me I say that washing approach tried to smear at the exact same Donald Trump is getting on a stage and he's saying they're fake news it was just this divine moment trying to smear you so they call it's me and pretended to be my friend I'm like I just wanna know what happened like I told my story I gave him messages of like Zoey the time stamps the the hate that I've been receiving and then the articles that they wrote we're like the I'm like did I just have a conversation with you on the phone like insane stuff like I mean like you know the Washington Post actually because I caught them in a lie I recorded the conversation and the email of what she wrote didn't match they pulled the article I said if you run this article like I will sue you guys for libel and the manager pulled the article he was like you're not even relevant or even important really we don't have to run this article they were ready to lie were they ready to lie about they were trying to make it they were trying to make it seem that I had like they were trying to figure out who was funding so like social autopsy was what that was the met like what the journalists were trying to figure out for whatever reason like who's helping you so when I refused to say any names I just got that weird gut feeling on the phone like I'm like why are you like I'm telling you like this girl's been harassing herself why are you trying to figure out like where I'm getting money from you know and when I refused to answer the the girl was going to lied and tried to say that I had said certain names that she was just trying to get like other anti bullying like organizations to come out and say I was liar like say I was working with them I had never said any name ster on the phone and somebody gave me a tip like one of the anti I'm not gonna say the name of that they gave me a tip and said that you know they called and you know did you tell them this and I was like no I was like I literally had the recording and they were like you need to lawyer up like the Washington Post is trying to smear you because he just what was it that they said that you hadn't said they were trying to say that they were basically going to try to get a really reputable anti-bullying company okay to issue a strong statement against me calling me a liar but this company because I had been in touch with them because I have been on the phone with them had a sense that it just wasn't like they didn't feel they're not the reporter either so they gave me a heads-up I had actually recorded the conversation with the Washington Post and what was in the conversation that they didn't want to prove they were gonna print that like I said that this company you know was supporting me and they reach out to that company and that company denied it I had never said that it was just the way to say that I was a liar but I never said would you get the conversation there's like my instinct was just like record the conversation yeah so so imagine like that you go through that and then Donald Trump gets on the stage and he's like the washington post is vacant news Jeff Bezos okay it was just like this I still order things from Amazon I do I know that one click I know it's just amazing I know it's it's I shouldn't I shouldn't but what do you need Krazy Glue I hear there's another company coming out and I need Alec Ross Pam one-click he's got us all I know I know I know I do - I can't even invite I know it just shows it's there it's just hot when you get home it's there it's home to you know do you think he has anything to do with the Washington Post is like it's his personal diary now you think so of course have you seen the stuff that they were they're publishing I don't know I subscribe to it online yeah meaning I pay to get it online pay for propaganda well occasionally have a good story yeah I'm no it's all it's propaganda I can't take any other article serious but they've run and that they've said it's just like like what oh it's just just everything nothing like this stuff that they have you read like the Washington Post lately do like what was the last good article let me ask you what was the last that you thought this was a fair and balanced reporting job by Washington Post they don't hate Trump they just want to report a very difficult question because I read too many articles I'd have to go back and see which one what's the number one what's the number one article on the top of yeah that would be interesting what do you think let's guess that's guessing Trump I'm gonna go ahead with it out there okay well it could be worth saying as it correlates to Trump maybe it's what's-her-face be me that story they're gonna brace I have to be okay lin-manuel Miranda stops metal tariffs trigger retaliation for Mexico I win trade war yeah but leave that Samantha be apologizes after White House can condemnation for calling Ivanka Trump a vulgar word I went to forgiving her are they they're forgiving her in that just think of the headlines yeah she apologies and she looks nice in that picture are they forgiving her they're gonna she apologizes after compton nation gone Ivanka Trump awkward why don't they just write can't apologizes for airing the word oh they did it on TV wait a minute wait a minute it's on our TV show cut the fuck it's insane yeah that's TBS had to apologize to TBS said cunt no it was on her shows on TBS but doesn't say cunt like the word I think they just apologized for it no no I'm saying did they air the actual word or did they be I don't know that's a good question because remember when Stephen Colbert when he said he that Trump uses Putin uses Trump's mouth for his cock holster yeah they've said like that shit's crazy that's what I know like that's what I'm losing mind just imagine imagine the worst our black conservatives like like them we get the things that people say to us and what's bizarre now is like white liberals like they just feel comfortable say I'm like white like this it's like so weird though right and they'll say anything to me here goes CBS networks makin is taking the right action apologizing what for the vile and inappropriate language used about a vodka Trump last night those words should not have been aired it was our mistake to and we regret it what is this I don't I do not like the way they worded that right she's taken the rights action so they they have a positive action attributed to her before when you read when you read what how they're going to interpret it washe was there it's always gonna it's gonna be positive but fired that's oddly positive I'm not gonna know because there's a double standard there's a double standard and this is what like fired Roseanne when she had the number one show in the country they just threw away a lot of money with that one yeah and and also you know and did a lot of jobs for people to hook it up she doesn't want to do it anymore talking to Roseanne yeah personally I think she was so worn out from doing that show she's 66 years old right you know and she's not in the best of health and she told me she got bronchitis doing the show and she almost died she's like I'm too fucking old for this shit right I can't do this anyway and they were wearing me I just wished that there were just a little more humanity like and I'm not saying that it's just like I'm really fundamentally strongly dislike something about the outraged culture and the willingness to like forego the fact that she's a human being and humans like there's something about people that they believe that human beings are perfectible like and that tractable yeah and I think this is something the left has sold the idea that is perfectible that you can like defeat racism with the right person in office that you can like you know defeat sexism you can defeat misogyny and this is not possible you can't defeat these things bad things happen because human beings are constantly learning we're flawed right but don't you think that ultimately the direction that we're all moving in as human beings if you looked at human beings from 3,000 years ago to human beings of today we're moving in a general direction of a much more positive culture like is does to me to me it does racism is negative can't be depleted but don't you think it can be shunned out of society slowly but surely if people realizes repercussions but then you're operating from a few dozen that you're not racist because you're afraid to say it no but people realize that you know it hurts people's feelings and it causes all sorts of issues and no human beings especially when they're in and I've learned this whole time when they're in the spot where they're fundamentally unhappy it's very easy for them but you know lash out and so if you find someone who's just miserable right who doesn't you know have I don't know the career the girl whatever it is that person is much more likely to say something that's vitriolic and that's just that's the human condition like you're not happy so you lash out at someone else I agree with you but don't you think that human beings in general are less racist today certainly less racist publicly in America then 1950 oh my gosh yes no question it passed fifty eight years ago if we go back sixty-eight years ago the world has changed for the better oh like one hundred percent in terms of like the social project progress that we've made especially in America do you think that sixty-eight years from now we could at least come very close to eradicating racism um that's a very good question so if you're talking about just America yes well let's just go with America because let's just write up because I don't know what the fuck's going on China yeah you know wherever that's why I say like go away they change it up because then they'll say Americans are racist towards Muslims right when you say that you're gonna do the Muslim the Muslim ban from certain countries and that's also considered like racism and not just like you know national security right so everything sort of becomes racism so the problem with racism is nobody knows it means anymore well everything's racist you can you you could the Starbucks situation which to me was not racist it was racist is that racism the Starbucks wasn't race it you don't think that was racist no so you think if those were white dudes hanging out in Starbucks not buying anything just sitting down mind their own business that they would've got fucked with with the same let's play a few pictures the first time I live in Philadelphia I'm not kidding I wonder if sometimes when I'm there I'm like I wonder if any white people live here like Philadelphia is like it's 44% black not just excluding Hispanic 44% black it's unbelievable everyone who works in my build everyone's black it's like the weirdest thing I'm like this is a very black city right suppose our city to be racist outright racist in like you're dealing the black people all day so you remove that and then you think to me and I've seen this happen tons of times it's it possible right that this guy was just some like a power tie guy power trips happen I've seen it happen at the most bizarre places I'm like all right like I at the airport the other day like this woman gave me absolute hell that's yes I mean it was like I came recaptured it was just absolute hell I could have walked away and said she was racist and she randomly selected my bag 22 times to go through and made me go through and miss my flight right or she was having a bad day and she was power tripping you know and then people have these little positions it's like that that movie where they go doorman you know like and they have these little positions like the manager of Starbucks and and you're having an off day and these two kids that could have easily said I'll buy a cookie right like common decency by the way even for me if I go use the bathroom at Starbucks I'll just freakin buy a cookie or a little like a juice box or water just something that makes me feel alright it's a little more civilized if I just buy something even though I'm just here to use the bathroom like so I'm both you gotta pee real bad there's a line you go and then i-i'll probably sprint to the bathroom and then buy something afterwards I do that this is like a natural thing I like it because of these guys you could just now rich culture since II like my cousin who's half-mexican on black had to go through this training and she works for Starbucks it's like it's to me just insane it's like is it possible that this guy was power tripping these kids were being like you know that could have just bought something and it could have been resolved but you have two people that are being stubborn and and taking it to as far as possible you know talk about a call monitor like you know these are the rules and it just got too far well perspective that is possible but it's also possible that they were racially selected yeah that someone was racist looked at them and they said these guys are black yeah we don't want them sitting around here and not buying anything I don't know weren't they just waiting for their friend too the whole thing didn't make how long were they sitting there because I want to say 45 minutes but that's like until the cops got there like there probably weren't I mean how long does it take to get the cops to come in Philly wait sorry I'm just like if you were sitting there I know I don't know I've never called the cops unfeeling but I do know that like really is it's a it's just a very it's a very black city yeah time it's a very black city you know I was there with Dave Rubin and John Peterson Peterson yeah you know I opened for them and it's just it's a them you just stand up yeah I should do stand up I'd be good at it you think I'm plenty come out tonight oh yeah I'll get you up I'll do it oh no I can't I have a I'm going to Wyoming right after this yeah you have any ideas of what you would talk about if you went on stage I would be really funny though I'm like randomly really funny randomly I'm good at voices not when people pay no I would be really good like I'm really good voices like really good like I I'm not going to believe that most people think they would do really good stand-up but I talk shit yeah yeah I can see that it's just like I'm not funny anymore it seems I probably would be like a drinker if I was onstage I feel like I would be like that like stereotypical comedian that just gets completely sloshed and goes out since just to try to loosen up the labs yeah I think it's a really hard thing to try it to be funny in front of like a sold-out room I think it's important to be objective and I think it's important to to look at something for what it really is and I think it's highly possible that that Starbucks thing was racist I see I think it's just as yeah it's just a great culture it's here we are it's got it's got to be racist it's like yes the chances I'm just telling you like so a lot of black people that come in I work from the Starbucks I'm writing a book I work from Starbucks all over Philadelphia that's like what I do right and it's it's just there's I don't know if there's any white people in Philadelphia I'm constantly I did a show there recently where what area of town where you know was in the tower theater that's where we were but they probably commuted oh the fuck yeah they do yeah it's all black people sure yeah so it's a bizarre place thank you yeah it's rough it's really rough and after people don't understand I'm like dude like it's a weird place to come to if you're racist just so it's like really hard to be racist and Philadelphia because everyone's black like it's like we went to the movies once and we saw Planet of the Apes actually ironically in a really black neighborhood and then we were it was I was there for the UFC and it was me and again my friend Tommy from Connecticut and we were looking for somewhere to go and we went to this uber black neighborhood and it was a fucking blast he's right it was hilarious right because I never I never go to all-black movie theater they were yelling shit at the screen I mean it became like it was there was the audience that was entertaining and there was a movie at her tail he's there's one scene in the movie where the you know the Planet of the Apes got what was the guy's name Caesar got mad is like oh you fucked up barbequed we were high out of our minds so the whole thing was like extra hilarious black hole this is the thing it's in so funny cause so much of what I do is inspired by this it's just like people like this I guess presentation of black people in the media it actually gets me mad because to me and I could be biased I think black people are like the most like funny like we're so funny so endearing like when I'm around my cousins like I there's not a better time that I can have when I'm around my family we're not easily offended right we're constant making fun of each other making fun of other people like there's no one meaner black people were portrayed like victims like everything upsets us like we're just we feel so oppressed and I'm like this is not like the the black community that I grew up in in my family and it's also not the the black community which is like who we celebrate like I was watching was it Chris Rock stand up bigger and blacker I watched that like from 1994 classic like it is like the stuff that he said he could never say today just like that is black culture if he went there on every single race every single culture made fun of everybody and it was beautiful it was perfection it was a sold-out Apollo Theater he comes out in the first thing he says it's like ray she was like Oh white people in the back today you know what I mean and everyone gets up and starts cheering and they starts making fun of black people about things that we need to fix right he's using like it's he's being funny but he's also saying stuff that's real talking about that baby mama culture and the difference between like the white community he started she's talking about school shootings you know just like maybe it was Columbine that just happened and he starts talking about that and nobody was sensitive nobody nobody in the audience was going the all right that was a different time you know inundated with school shootings there's so many of them now that people are just twisted they don't know what to do right so I don't know I don't agree with this is the problem with when you blame the NRA no one in the NRA is ever committed to school I know it's it's insane it's it's bizarre that people blame them but there's an argument that there should be tighter regulations on people with mental illness people with the slope is incredibly slippery for that it's like it's something you can't define like it's it's just a mental illness right yeah it's too slippery what do you store does that mean does that mean if you go to one therapy session like it is so slippery yes I don't like it it's a dangerous way to go down having to be 21 to be able to buy a gun I'm against it because you shouldn't be able to go get your limbs blown off overseas if you can't come back and defend your home totally against it well that's a good argument that you shouldn't be able to go to war if you're not 21 either right you know I think the frontal cortex isn't developed into you're 25 years old so who knows who knows when you can make real good rational decisions for yourself and the idea is that if you take a set ten year old kid fresh out of high school and send him overseas to put a gun in his hand like he doesn't really know exactly what he's doing in the first place exactly not making informed choices you're just following the lead of the people that are in command you're hoping that they're telling you the right thing to do I think that's so bizarre to me is that we're sitting here and we're talking about the age like as if guns were just created like you know when it's actually right but something's wrong but what's wrong is it's not the guns I'm asking you what do you think is wrong mental health right so I say I agree with you but I think it's deterioration of culture altogether like they used to be taught the Bible in school like you know what people people make fun of that now like now we've got this culture where you're making fun of kids like religion is like we're so far away from religion like that's like weird to us like you know like teaching religion is like it's you've got like a scarlet letter if you come in as like a holy Christian kid in like a normal public public education thing you got the family structure where it's like these kids are running the houses these days like I look on like Facebook and it's like supposed to be funny you want like a four-year-old it's acting like cardi B I'm like okay yes it's funny because she's four but it's also like not funny because she's four right like how do you feel about little tang who's little tay i love car you got a little taste kind of out of the news now because they found that it's a hustle she's a nine-year-old asian girl from what Vancouver so it's from and she talks mad shit throws money around calls everybody bitches and haters like this is considered like funny it's like entertaining like the fact that and and we're okay with that and so parents are pushing their kids to be more outrageous cuz there's a way that they can make it so to me it's like okay spotted hanging out with Rick Rubin she looks like she's like how old is she she fingers oh those are hooks you should get the horns up and she's got a G Wagen in front it's just like the cash to me outside girl oh great so we don't talk about any of that we don't talk about the fact that that we no longer focus on family we know it's no longer to focus on religion doesn't need to be doesn't mean to be that everyone needs to be religious but they're structure in religion right they're structure and in me when I grew up in and my grandpa used to make us read the Bible around the table there was some structure to that and in lessons and in prayers that and then there's this mass the the Facebook the snap the snapping the the Instagram atwitter it's like we've changed the world and expected children to say then say the same of it and nobody talks about it so said they say it's the guns fault we need to be stricter gun gun legislation but the entire world has shifted we're not talking about those changes the dynamic of the world that is shifted so I I just hold the different position I you know I think it starts with family it starts with structure I think we need we need religion back I think that that needs to stop being such a dirty word and it's not being mocked roundly by the media like it shouldn't be funny you know when Joy Behar you know says something about Jesus and the whole audience giggles that's weird Mike Pence be mentally yeah because he talks to Jesus that think about how weird that is right like how weird that the stuff that we used to would be normal like you know praying talking with you just like when I grew up that was like my grandparents generation that was everyone was religious and now we're so far away from that right that that that seems like like it's okay to mock and we roundly mock it all the time so these the structure in the home is in my opinion the most important thing that needs to change fact that some people are growing up without fathers in the home is something that needs to change letting your kid have a Facebook account when they're seven right like just it's just too much it's the information age but what information are they downloading well I definitely think that people need structure I definitely think that people need family and community and all those good things but when it comes to religions like which one is right it's not like there's not okay I'm gonna be honest I know nothing about Scientology so I'm not I know that people hate Scientology that's all I know about it created by a science fiction writer okay and it's all nonsense that's all you need to know okay yeah it's one of the dumbest religions of all time if you read like what they are Leah Remini who was in it for years yeah I didn't watch her series she'd been on my podcast and she explained her journey into it and what happened with it and when she started to question it and there's a whole thing there's a what is the fucking HBO documentary it's also the book the HBO on Scientology the Lawrence Wright going clear going clear yeah yeah I read the book and I watch the that's like so crazy I know nothing about it besides like Tom Cruise I'm gonna be honest I'm totally ignorant yeah it's you know for some people here's the thing for some people its structure and it's helpful right ideologies are helpful sometimes because they give you like a like a format to live your life by or scaffolding to keep your your your moral beliefs inside of these boundaries and it helps you get ahead and you have purpose and decision-making but at the end of the day it's a cult how do you decide deciding issues that there's something that comes from I think just learning certain lessons it doesn't need to be - I'm not saying that we source our life structure from structure like like if the Bible used to be taught in school objectively they would be taught by people that you know we're not practicing Christians right used to be taught in school objectively because there's still lessons that are timeless in these Bible stories they're something to do with whether or not you're you don't need to then say oh and then we go to church and then we pray in school and all that stuff you can almost extract that and try to teach these lessons objectively but what kids are learning now is like how to be an anarchist like you know feminism 101 and every it's you're like actually fostering an angry culture by telling them in every term if they should be outraged we are in outraged culture and then you're you're surprised when somebody does something outrageous right it's it's a little bizarre to me it's like everything should issue up everything should make you angry everything should make you upset everything is unjust everything is oppressed and I don't know why this kids to show up a school obviously so angry like it's like if we're weird it's like we're weirdly fake and no one wants to have the conversation the shooting happens and everyone's talked about the NRA and then David hog is is back on the news Jordan Peterson has some interesting ideas about religion and the fundamental beliefs and the lessons that are learned from things like the Bible and how they apply to human life and there are our own belief systems without them without these sort of structures and belief systems is one of the things that leads civilization astray and that it's done that before and things go awry well I actually had this debate with Charlie and I did a panel down in DC and we were talking about whether like you know the reintroduction of God and teaching him to school and I said like at some point there seems to be the struggle I have this idea that like human beings in a certain way we're doomed just keep repeating history I'm obsessed with Greek mythology I'm obsessed with like Egyptian history hieroglyphics like anything that like where they tell stories especially Greek mythology because the lessons are there and we just keep doing it right greed lust like the things that human beings fall for right so I had this idea we were talking cuz Charlie is an adventure of a Christian I'm not right I believe in I I the super smart guys and evangelical yes she believed like Jesus came back to life yes really yes so he believes that someone died yeah and then three years three days later he came back to life and that they walked on water and yeah I mean I haven't really gotten into a thing was I'm not like I'm not the person that should ever be like debating or talking about religion it's not my like stick I guess but so what I said to him cuz made him both believe that in many ways the reason that the government has the media I started around Lea dissing God right like I'm dissing Jesus Christ it's because the government wants to be God right so if people in a minute do you think the media is responding to the government's suggestion is that what you think the reason why people are going after religion is the ninety is responding to some sort of orders from the government now orders that's that's wrong so it's direct dude no no but you know Andrew Andrew Breitbart said that politics is downstream from culture right so and you can argue that they they feed into each other whatever it is but there's there's definitely something between culture and politics that is linked inextricably linked so when you know when it when everyone's on the same page like so if the government wants to get bigger which it has been doing right and wants people to look to them for answers which it has been doing you have to understand they have to sort of destroy everything else that they would potentially be looking to for answers right so instead of when you're down and out and people would just go to church and pray right or believing in your family or the family structure they need to know that no matter what you think the government is the answer that is what a leftist at the end of the day the what believes that the government can fix all of their problems and and I find especially when I specialized left us they do not believe in religion like just a thing I've noticed that you know I'm not religious I'm not saying that you know there's something wrong with it but leftists tend to be you know really apart from religion so you could make the argument could definitely be made that the destruction of believing in the Bible if stopped teaching the Bible is because you want to make it so that every time you have a problem because you're still gonna our soul we still need to believe in something we're naturally beings that we need to believe that something can fix something I really believe that that it's the reason why we go get our palms read right like we just like there's there's something else somebody has the answer and people are starting to believe it's government in America well it freaks me out I I agree with you that people like structure and I agree with you the people without religion try to find that structure and those rules and other things back but I don't believe that this is like some calculated nature I think it's human nature shift yeah well it's it could be daddy yeah we want someone to tell us what to do and if that daddy is the government or if that get daddy is aliens where the fuck it is people need someone and I Charlie because then he said you know you got rid the government now we have to go back to religion and then I said okay but charlie but then we could actually recreate all the terrible stuff to happen with religion when religion became daddy so we might just be going government religion government religion government you know what I mean just appendages of corruption in both and that's that's what I believe yeah so I think that we could say that yeah we need to start being using these things but then we could just end up with the extreme again where there's massive corruption in the church not everyone's placing other in the church so that I just said Wow we're just doomed I don't think we're doomed Mark Twain had a great line history doesn't repeat itself but it rhymes interesting Duncan told me that yesterday yeah yeah yeah it often rhymes that's the quote I think it repeats itself fully like we had like all of the signs there I'm like we could literally just read this all in a Bible we could read the song Greek mythology and we know what happens like it's like it's our humanity and but there's is it fixable no that's why people think that society perfectible it's not perfect well there's going to be greed there's going to be lust there's gonna be but now we're in this culture where it's like he cheated on his wife like oh like these humans are different than we used to be and if we keep moving in this direction we're going to improve we're going to continue improve I think the link Queens cynical is not cynical it's just it's just a bit it's it but there's just always during your lifetime perhaps but the ideas that we're moving to a greater head yeah moving towards a greater good that someday our children will enjoy and that we are in a better situation and our grandparents were our grandchildren will be in a better situation than us and we're constantly moving towards improvement and this is the reason why we're so dissatisfied with racism and sexism and homophobia and hate and all the bullshit that we see in the world that can be prevented we think that if we can shun that and shame that and push it out of our culture that some day in the future we'll have gotten past this and evolved to the point where we as a culture and we as a civilization will be something that we are proud of and we're not proud of what we are now with school shootings people dependent on oxycottons and seven-year-olds on facebook and we'll take really flashing cash in front of a g-wagen there's a lot of shit that's nothing no he wants talking about over medicating children like when I was a kid is sick she was bouncing off the walls we just said you were hyper today it's like give him adderall like iced babysit a kid in like the mom would give them adderall he was six years old there's a I don't know what's wrong with I'm like I think might be a kid you know and and that's member clgs don't want to I look I have kids when kids are going crazy and you're tired it's fucking hard yeah but you don't medicate no it's bizarre and and then they say oh well you know something's wrong with him he's in school and he's not you know performing as well he's not paying attention maybe he's just not interested yeah maybe he'd rather be outside well I remember that very well and I remember thinking when I was in school I am never going to tell my kids that they have to pay attention to some fucking boring shit right that maybe you want them to pay attention but assume that there's something wrong with them if they don't is what's crazy to me they assume there's something wrong with their child and that they need medicine because they're not paying attention to math problems on the board for an hour that's what scared me it's like kind of sit down it's the whole thing is unnatural right I totally agree with you like I am like so anti and you see that like there's this like famous Kanye quote where he says like when you see a five-year-old they have so much energy but there's they have so much confidence and so much passion and everything that they do like they think they can be anything right they can be a dancer or a singer they'll try to do flips and then go find like an 11 year old after they've been socialized in school they're like that spark just dies in them and it's because they're literally being put through a system that tells them that they can't well this girl got a 90 on her test and you got an 80 so something must be you know you're not getting this right well maybe math it's just not her thing right maybe she does she doesn't she's not as good at math as somebody else I think everybody has their own pieces of brilliant and that the current education system does not foster to those individualism they're actually trying to create a collectivist society by being able to measure you know a kid's brilliance by standardized testing something's wrong and I very much agree disagree I don't think they're necessarily doing that but what they are is uninspired and underpaid and they're boring and kids go to their classes and they're bored out of their fucking mind they have any other stupid grade so they can keep going me yeah I was I was so bored I was those personalities well you're you got a lot of energy I always felt like they were stupid like you know I'm like as this teacher even like smarter than but can we take a test like it just say quick IQ test to see if I should even have to take a class from someone who's actually dumber than me and we're having those thoughts like in high school just being like these aren't even smart sometimes like they're you're not alone like it good news is that from that you get this dissatisfaction this feeling of just just not not wanting to be a part of this anymore and then you start seeking other ways to make a living other ways to get I mean for me it's and people responded to it and so how did you go full-blown conservative you've been the White House yes I how the fuck have you been the White House you serve it for two years two years ago this is why some concern online no I'm telling you it's because you're like a conservative wet dream a little bit of jealousy but I'm like I'm not sure this is but this is like I believe in this so much that I wish we could stop that because like I'm like no let's change the paradigm like let's get Trump to do the like the Joe Rogan show as opposed to saying you don't I mean like there's but people don't see things like the way it's all about me me me the ego comes out you know so but anyways um so I I met Charlie that was a huge thing that happened I was speaking at the David Horowitz Freedom Center look Charlie's 24 you could ask he's flying around with the first family too but he when you meet him you understand he's just absolutely brilliant and we just wanted to do this together I met him and I said look I think that there needs to be a black revolution against the Democratic Party I think I'm the person to lead it like I'm your girl and I was speaking on a panel with Dave Rubin about why I left the left and what I understood about the left and he hired me on the spot and the rest of sort of history you know I mean that's that's really I worked I work my ass off the wasn't that so who hired you Charley Kirk he actually runs Turning Point USA I know he's like so young it's insane and you had you should look him up and figure out who he is because he's in my opinion he's gonna be a future present United States and everyone says that everyone every show he's bound in Fox is like very rarely do you mean like Rush Limbaugh just said very rarely do you meet someone to think that's going to be a president of United States Charlie Kirk oh yeah the rush is probably on like 18 different kinds of pills when you say yeah but yeah he's clean no rush doing clean now I didn't even know that he was not clean he took 100 pills a day that's scary to me well he went deaf he went deaf from taking pills do you understand this yeah get a fucking I won't even I'm just like you know who told me that by the way fair fair warning Alex Jones he explained to me he explained to me the mechanism of rush limbaugh going deaf from taking pills to rush if I'm wrong I'm sorry right I I have no idea right yes laughs that's true it's true oh that he went deaf from taking pills yeah that he almost Wikipedia never lies look up mine exactly me and Bryan Callen are for brothers and sisters but yeah so I just I I just I've worked incredibly hard I feel like I haven't slept since last year I I'm traveling every day for seem like a politician but not on I'm not well ask me like they're like Candice what are you like what are you gonna do I'm like I'm not a polished a girl who talks about stuff that I believe in and people view me as a politician I don't I just say it's from the pills oh you pulled that article I'm sorry I didn't interrupt you but I pulled that article on the screen what about me seems like a Paul this is what I don't get no you're little bit polished you've got a little bit of a sort of point you've said these things before what and you're very a lot of the things you're saying you're very good at it you've got a a well-oiled path there's it's a nice groove in your brain where you know how to say these things then occasionally you pop out of it and you just plain Candace but you know when you're like I'm gonna leave black America I'm gonna go against the I believe you believe it believe you said it many many times what I just said to you yeah yeah I told you I told this to Charlie Kirk in November this is what I want to do this is my plan so I'm just a person that's going after my goal and then as I started accomplishing it people are just like throwing shade and hate and I'm like dude like now it's turned into like what has been the shade and the hate that you think is like unworn like okay so first off like let's not pretend like we can talk about social justice like warriors on the Left we have him on the right - let's not pretend we don't have the people that like they can't like as soon as I got to a hundred thousand YouTube followers every youtuber suddenly was like who is this deep dive and then they came with the like she was she as she be she she she created so shot that she because she wanted to Doc's my like the most bizarre I have youtubers that are looking up like has she ever dated a black guy but the most absurd I'm like what are you guys doing like can we just all like just peacefully coexist I'm just saying like what would be the issue it'll be the article I know I'm like what is the article but here the same boyfriend from high school any happen to be white it would be a big probably an article as for sure 100% but they just start like digging it and I'm just like guys I'm just working hard and if you want to know what my strategy is I don't make videos about you guys I I make news about what I care about I have a brand and to find my brand your brand is just going after people and that's not that's not a brand at all that's that's a weird thing on YouTube they have these little communities if only attack each other in the communities yes have you ever seen the the vegan hate videos where they go after each other but yeah it was like banana what's a banana girl or something there's a few or freely or something I've heard about it fuck is great I call you to bug you - hi like it's like I think I and I was like a new girl who showed up but they're like 40 yeah I know that's what's weird but like I was like the new girl who shut up and like it like the cheerleading team on the sixteen I don't want to be a youtuber I just plugged my content on YouTube okay and then I really hate me yeah that's bizarre that's just like totally weird but it's fine as I never rented them because like they're like they don't have like there's no branding or go outside they I really don't think they go outside but there's no brand if you see they run run right back inside and make another it's bizarre you so there's YouTube high then you have what I call game of conservatives just like didn't it dude like they're all like racing for the throne and I thought I'm like guys like there's like White Walkers at the wall like you know the depth is trying to like turn this into Commerce America can we not compete for like the egos it's like it's helping to save America I genuinely believe that like right now is the only time that we have to save this country I genuinely worried about like we're at the cliff I think if Donald Trump did not win the election we would have lost America a genuine Austin hit like Hillary the global initiative just this like the like they were like communists like it just to me I really believe that this is an opportunity to sort of like we're like the last stand for Western civilization look what's going on in Europe it's like insane and people don't understand that I'm like what is going on in Europe right now he's like they're likely Europe's done like you do to watch the preview video like Europe has committed suicide or whatever it was called no but I had Douglas Murray on the podcast he was trying to explain to me his book strange death of Europe I think he did a pretty are you video on that too maybe yeah it's it's real like they've lost Europe and The Last Stand for us in civilization is America and then you have people that are competing for egos and like guys know like there's white walkers at the white but well I don't understand how you think that we you were almost losing America and there's a battle for America I've really thought that like just in in every regard in terms of just just the people that were running like Hillary Clinton like this woman was a globalist like just think about who we were who we were in bed with like Rabia selling all of our uranium to Russia like like Trump came in and was like no like America people we were at the gap like we lost them we're losing the middle class a gap between the rich and the poor was like literally what do you think is causing that policies shipping all of our jobs overseas the regulation the government getting bigger barrier you can't do anything as an entrepreneur entrepreneur in America without a piece of paper from the government discouraging people with a piece of paper extending like shutting down the factories from getting that there's something you know there's a little land between New York and LA I believe it or not like you know and this is what Trump understood we were losing that and and Trump appealed to that those people I'm still floored like as I'm traveling the world and seeing different pieces of the country I'm learning how ignorant I was like and that's the best thing in the entire world just I fell victim to the idea that like it was progress it was progress it was progress we have to care about the environment it was progress and it's like no like we've been losing America has been losing and Donald Trump understood that and in a way that I didn't and I think we have to care about the environment okay let me clarify this I don't throw trash on the ground I'm not saying like we need to like you know trash the environment like but do I believe in climate change no you don't believe in climate change no I think the climate always changes I guess especially do I believe if this is like you know an issue that is being global warming which they've changed coming they got rid of the word once scientists started disproving it now they only say client climate change now I think that that was just a way to extract dollars from Americans I don't at all believe they had no actionable plan it was great for Trump to get out of that deal it was terrible okay but this is an incredibly complicated subject right and if you would have to talk to a bunch of different scientists and see how they gather data and see what they understand about co2 levels and what's the danger of that and what can combat it and what could not have you done all this around Flippen opinion this is not this wouldn't be the hill I died on right but it's not about part I just genuinely I've read a ton about it but I would not be able to I would not be able to come to you and say like this is my strong opinion but here's like the easiest way to say this right the fact that there is a disparity and the science community was enough to very little very little disparity most most most scientists most the the vast majority agree that human beings are negatively affecting climate change yeah the vast majority yeah I don't I just don't think so you so you think that the very few scientists that disagree with your consensus are the ones that are correct well I think if something is it's it's either subjective or its objective and their objective truths right but it's subjective if you're saying that there are some I don't think there's very little there are some that don't get paid to go on TV then some that are not Bill Nye who are not funded scientists and and that has been a hold well Bill Nyes not a scientist not Bill Nye is like a science influencer or a science entertainer he's like he doesn't have a background in actual science he's not a scientist has no PhD well he promotes science I mean science is not bad the the real problem is with climate change is that with for sure there has been ups and downs throughout the history of this planet their observable they've they follow them in we was one of the subjects that I had earlier today with dr. Robert Schoch 2014 the vast majority 87% of scientists said that human activity is driving global warming yet only half the American public public ascribed to that view so what website 87% and this is Scientific American yeah yeah calm though like that means it's it's making money I don't trust that if it was a.org I would probably take that but that this is just a random website and Scientific American is not necessarily a random website yeah I don't I don't believe this like at all just so you know you don't believe it like I genuinely I genuinely don't believe I know you do but I genuinely don't believe it I believe at the time the consensus of scientists that are studying the data right and so what they're doing is like remember all of the stories that came out about the scientist that said that when they tried to present their evidence to show like they were basically was getting shut down at every corner you can pull that up to like scientists look up I guess look up the opposite right instead of instead of looking for you're looking for that you're not looking for I didn't search for that's what I found on I sorry yeah yeah look up like what this is my question why are you so sure this is a dream Lee complicated subject and it is and I said I am not so sure that I would die on the hill for it my opinion right now and it is just that it was a means because forget the fact of whether you believe global warming is real let's say it's 100 percent real it's a beam over factorial is there well let's be clear yeah global warming global climate change is definitely real it's happening well questions always happen yes so what what are we what is the this is the climate change yes the climate changes it was different weather yesterday than it was today the climate is forever changing like that that's the problem is that people are making it seem like that's something weird it's not you're misrepresenting the issue the issue is people think that human beings are exacerbating climate change to the point where there's a there's a tipping point we cross over that tipping point we're gonna deal with huge problems that could be corrected if we act now and put a lot of funding into climate control okay this is what Howard Bloom was on talking about a few days ago he was talking about that the real future involves the technology of climate control and that what we have to be really careful of is letting it get to far where you can't ever stop it and pull it back this is what scientists are warning about this is why they want emission standards this is why they want to figure out how to get people to be aware of the fact this is a real issue and now irregardless human beings if they never existed the earth has constantly gone through cycles the question is not whether or not the earth has gone through cycles of cooling and warming the question is are we exacerbating that the vast majority of scientists say we are okay now this could this could negatively impact all sorts of coastal cities this could be a gigantic problem this is not like propaganda that's drummed up by some sort of big business that seeks to make money off of this or some sort of a of it Al Gore might have made some money on nobody we made that we were in they were they were that was like the amount of money that America was losing but here's what I was gonna ask you so what's the amount of money America was losing in the Paris agreement this is the reason why we wanted to gather the Paris agreement but that's why I want to get yours so let's say we all agree that global warming is real I don't believe it's real okay so I can't see why I have a belief what do you mean why have a belief it's whether or not global warming is real or not real because I tracked but why have a belief in it right so it's how I believe it's not a belief and I don't believe in it but you have a belief that it doesn't exist right I know I I personally think that this was just the next the fact that it was presented to us by Al Gore and it's just it was not it's not presented to us by it just by Al Gore Al Gore made a film right and he's been called like the first green billionaire it's made a shitload of money up for that any flies in his private plane because he's so worried about the emissions that is hilarious yeah all of the people that are telling us a fucking politician right there's there's gross to all this stuff right and that's what worries me so my question is let's say that it's real okay let's just assume look if that's the best way to do you feel that you have found in your research that there is something that human beings can do that would change this all around it's possible yes one of the things that they're figuring out how to pull carbon out of the atmosphere and even even possibly reuse it there's there's all sorts of things that people are trying to do I mean we had was a young man who made that device Boyan boy on slot he figured out a way to make this device that pulls plastic out of the oceans they're figuring out a way Horton yeah there's a lot well pluck is plastic just can't like over time but that's I mean like so when I say that I'm like it's like I I believe in recycling like I'm not like a person that's like this is all but the idea that the government is just gonna take trillions of dollars because we're in some agreement where we're all agreeing that we should do something is is useless and look from the stuff like there's obviously a lot of debate here and as I said like I'm not so at the one thing you always find with me is I'll never pretend to be so educated something like I'm not going on a college campus is talking about global warming I don't do that right but why are you saying I just don't I just I don't know maybe because I got through this maybe because it got so politicized studies into scientific agreement on human-caused global warming and look at all the studies it's between a hundred percent and ninety one percent at the lowest 91 percent of one of the studies from 2014 the Union of Concerned Scientists yeah work they almost it's it's a pretty broad consensus would it be a Hutu who are they polling part of this 306 scientists to confirm over 97% of climate scientists agree and over 97% of the scientific articles find that global warming is real and largely caused by humans so my question to you is if you want to step outside of the scientific consensus right which is vast and involves ten thousand three hundred and six scientists and just say I don't believe in it yeah even if you're right even if you're right you don't have enough information to say that right you're saying you don't believe yeah I would have to have someone sit down and convince me that it was real I personally don't believe it that's okay why it's good to start not believing something no it's not you think you should start with believing everything oh it's did not believe either or not believe yes not believe no but don't say you don't believe yeah learn about it yeah learn about it and then have an opinion but you're stating this opinion without having any real understanding what climates but that's that's exactly what an opinion is I'm not going like I said if if you said that Canada she went on to 10,000 college campuses and you said that global war wasn't real then we'd have a problem you and I just having a conversation yeah I have an opinion on something that you don't have data about this is my question yeah I don't necessarily have an opinion on climate science I really don't yes I don't know much about it but what I do know is that what I've read is that the vast majority of people who study it or in agreement that human beings are effect so I don't I just might recall on a lot of things that I read and this was a while ago so this is where I when I first formed in my opinion not believing this I read a shit ton of articles can't recall the data because it's like I said something I was super passionate about it was like somebody posted something and then I went on like a tarot reading about it but it was essentially just noting that in a lot of these studies like when you go and you if we had time to sit down and really pull this up they're pulling you know ten thousand scientists are within a community that is for like these works do you believe at everything that media mattered Media Matters org puts out for statistics right that's a political that's a political arm of the democratic politics versus science but this has been politicized that's has been yes it has global warming in particular has been politicized 100 percent it has been politicized right that's the whole reason I I fell down this dark hole one night reading about and I didn't I was like you know what today here it has been politicized I think that's also maybe why you're saying you don't agree with it so quickly right because it's an ideological right-wing point right is that global warming isn't real right if you're one of those people that thinks global warming isn't real you're almost always on the right right and that's fine but I'm telling you that like again I didn't do a deep dive on all of this because I read about it because it was at a forefront of discussion so I read about it all night and my conclusion was that they started pulling up all of these studies and the person that you know did this that I did a deep dive on and they started showing how like these community of scientists were in fact somewhere behind that org is someone that was being funded so to me the issue got too politicized for me to believe that global warming was something that was going to wipe out the world now scientists I John did that is a fact yes but that doesn't mean that the funding affects the scientific research and the data which they all agree on and this is universally across the entire planet thousands and thousands of scientists would not state their reputation on false data what what they're saying is not that the only reason why the world is getting warm is because human beings that the only reason why the climate isn't totally static for the rest of eternity because of human beings what they're saying is we are negatively impacting our own environment and we're doing it because we existing knowledge e and we use coal and fossil fuels and emissions and we're raising our co2 levels and this is based on data yeah and this is this is something that you can look at you could look at the data and and and follow where they're getting this information from and follow how they're making these conclusions and follow the vast majority of these shit their whole life exactly and if look if I was a person that was putting forth policy on climate change if I was a person that put out my opinion publicly on Paul on on climate change I would do all of that I'm just not I understand what you're saying but what I'm saying is that you're a very smart person yeah and people listen to you and they're going to listen to you for a long time everything what you do have to have is the ability to know when you don't know what the fuck you I just said that I said you asked me and I said this wouldn't be the hill I chose to die on because I don't I don't why do I say you don't believe in it because I just personally about not have a belief until you say okay so you would prefer if my language as opposed to admitting that I do not know this I wouldn't die a missile I've never made of you I've never made a public statement you would've preferred if I had just started by saying I have no I have no opinion no I don't know okay that's what I'm saying you you say I didn't know you say I don't believe in it yeah I don't believe in it you you're saying really clearly that you don't think it's real yeah I mean I think it would be the same if I said to you like you know do you believe in God right no I would say I don't know you would say if so if that's like this is sort of like linguistics though no I would say I don't know I always say people say like I believe I believe it or I don't right so it's like if you say I think a lot of people say they don't know okay I think believe is definitely where that's associated with God but don't believe in God and then somebody starts saying oh you need to form is it it's like oh no you don't because God is not scientific data right there's a big difference between measuring the co2 levels in the atmosphere and and the deciding whether or not there's an afterlife right I just I I'm sorry that I just don't believe I don't believe in global warming I'm happy to for allow to y'all believe even in mind nor an influencer yeah but you're a very bright person I would if somebody had asked me like at a place where I'm influencing on a college campus what's your opinion I would say I have none I bet you would say I don't believe it what you just did that is absolutely not what you just do we there are so many instances where you could watch it's just like and you can ask dave rubin when he asks me a question I say I don't have any peanut about a different subject yeah because you're you and I are having a conversation one-on-one I'm not I'm not sitting here to try to I don't go on campus talking about global warming because I don't I don't have an opinion on it but if you press me and asked if I believe in it no I don't really believe in it but could I go deep dive in and and learn that perhaps I'm wrong sure I personally am inclined to believe that a lot of those studies are manipulated as I said during the one night that I did deep dive on it when they showed like all the pieces of that you don't have evidence whatever it just seemed a little shady and I felt that it was politicized but I think I have a right to say that I don't believe in something but I also don't know and that's what I said to you I don't believe in it but I wouldn't die in this hill I don't know enough about it I don't say you wouldn't die in this hill what but you also said you don't believe in it and you stated the reason why because you think it's a scam yeah yeah that's the truth what do want me to lie to you okay that's fine but do you want me to lie to you and say I'm not a politician you want - you should the correct term like that I feel like this is like the editing of people do like when they're like Oh - question you don't know this is the I'm not running for office I'm answering I'm talking to you I don't believe in it shade that I appreciate you I can't be fake I die this is my number one problem in life is I can't be fake and I know that you're pressing the air and that you want me to adjust and to say like I don't I do not have an opinion or the effort I'm not like a politician I'm telling you I don't believe in it could I could I change my perspective if you were just a regular person you said I don't believe in it I probably all right the problem is you're not you're you're you're a very implement where I'm aware when I'm on stage when I'm on my youtube channel you there's no videos of Candice Owens talking about global warming I'm aware of that there is now yeah I just yeah exactly people gonna be mad at me for yeah yeah you know what's funny though is that like this feels so like we're now I mean or not right now but it's like I still don't do like Ronnie and this is the problem yeah well like if we were if you and I were on a college campus I'd be like yeah yeah I'm not really sure I don't know jack shit about global warming I only don't yeah I think what the real fear is not even global warned the real fear is global cooling the ice age is the most terrifying thing that can happen in human beings yeah that shit happens everybody dies yeah I know global warming you just move inland yeah I I think that the real thing that people are concerned about is like just beyond any of that stuff I don't know I think that there's like more concerns in society like III personally think that some scientists started talking about global warming and it got bluest I figured it was another way to extract human beings money because of fear that's my opinion I think there's probably some truth to that we're gonna find our core scientists that agree with everything we say if it's improvement Harvard studies have been incorrect because they were being funded by certain you know political interest groups so I'm not trying to pull up something and I'm blanking it'll come back to me in a second but there were Harvard papers that had been funded by certain researchers that are trying to get a certain political position out and it causes mass fear people are willing to spend their money in certain entirely possibly it is but it's real that's very people are fought so I'm not inclined when someone pulls up an article and says look a 10,000 scientists I err I'm assigned up okay I don't know those scientists re I don't know what the rest organization is funded by so I'm gonna stick by my gut and say I don't believe in it yet now if I decide that I'm gonna run for office and I've got to make a decision on on the atmosphere and and what we're gonna do about global warming and co2 emissions you better believe I will be fully ready to discuss it I'm not gonna make a youtube video and just know the outskirts of it I don't do that right but if you and I are having discussion sorry I don't believe it like I don't know what to say learning okay open to learning always open to learning I've I've been wrong before I was a liberal two years ago you know or three years ago so that's that's not a problem I'm open to learning but I'm not gonna like pretend like say something that feels inauthentic and what I wanted to say there was I don't believe in it this is one of those things that it's become it's a real right wing talking point it's like there's very few people like like pro-life is a very right-wing talking points very few I would imagine I'm not just guessing but very few liberals who are also pro-life well know so when I first weren't went on Dave Rubin show he asked me about that and I said I don't really know I'm for my opinion on it like just like you and I just said about global warming I said to Dave Rubin about pro-life and pro-choice and he was like this is the first time someone has just said that like just said that I'm forming a pain on and didn't feel like they need to get an answer and I said I'm not a politician same thing I'm saying to you like I can answer how I feel and sure and and I'm happy to learn but that's a different kind of subject right but then I wanted to get really educated on it and I I became pro-life but not because I think people that are pro-choice are awful human beings um you know who needed to burn in hell but just because the history of it is really shady with Margaret Sanger and because I do recognize that it does seem a little off-putting I don't say like you know I'm pro-life but I just say to people that like the idea that the left is so pro-choice at the same time that they are running around purporting to you know black lives matter it doesn't make any sense when you look at the numbers of you know black babies never even get a chance to live and when you look at the numbers and just understanding that 17 million black babies have been exterminated since 1973 so what kind of black lives do you care about I don't believe that baby's life starts after three months I think that that's crap that's scientific crap anybody we could probably pull up some articles that say for sure the baby's life does not begin until the three months we wonder the best indication that the baby's life begins before it because you have to rip it out of the stomach in order to kill it if left alone it would grow into a baby right so I've thought about that issue and now I have a stance on it like and that would be my stance you know if I was president of states I don't worry the present United States you know I let me say what I if I stepped up if my country needed me like you said ten years ago I would step up and I would do the job why do you have aspirations I promise you I get this question all the time on the road Candace do you want to be in the White House do you wanna be the my house I would love if Charlie Kirk was a president estates I would have fun being the press secretary I'd be like just let him in let the dogs in like I would it just looks like a fun job because they're so worried fuck is wrong with you that's like a fun job because they're just so crazy and I would just make fun at that too I feel like that's what I'm saying it would be a fun job they're so serious and like I'm like you take yourself seriously like Jim Acosta actually does not be running the government of the greatest empire the world has ever known you think that'll be fun seem remotely yeah I know I'm being I'm being a little facetious Ainley stress who's the press secretary now Saracen she look stressed out well I think she's just trying to have a game face she's just like what a stupid question looks like Jesus Christ it's one of those things that's like like how far can you swim some people could swim for 70 hours yeah nobody could swim forever yeah that's what that job looks like tomato yeah nobody gets run forever yeah yeah I didn't like I didn't start this because I wanted to get into politics I started this because I saw a dial that needed to be moved and well you're obviously a very ambitious person you seem very ambitious listen I'm good no matter what space I'm in whether like when I was in private equity I'm always good at my job when I put my mind to something I can do something and people will be blown away that's always in my character and and I will do it despite people saying I can't like it that to me my whole to do is people telling me I can't you know like I don't like when people try to put me in a box like I really don't like the whole idea that because you were this you can't be this like it's like I'm always going to decide what's best for me what led you to be Republican in the first place I'm not Republican well yeah right wing what are you if you're not Republican I'm independent no I would say I lean right I definitely need right because that to me is just if you believe that people are allowed to have different opinions you lean right like literally that's what we're at right now like it's like you're not even allowed to have a dissenting opinion I'm from Second Amendment I just hope right pro-life right anti-global warming you're the anti global warming thing is like this is like something that you're organized forced on me I genuinely like you're great right like this is I just I have no reason to believe that because some scientists that could very well be funded as we they're constantly things are consciously being funded to create a public perception I very much believe that I see that and we see this just in the case of Donald Trump there if you go pull people in California they're gonna say he's a racist sexist it's just whatever's put on the internet people believe as the truth I like to do a deeper dive I have not deeper dive on global warming save that one night when I went down dark hole what other like right wing talking points is there any that you don't agree with yes I don't know if this is like still a thing but I like I fully support gay marriage okay that's right and and and the reason is simple like regardless how people feel about gay marriage yeah the government has stepped in and is now doing marriage and the idea that two individuals that are in love two should get tax cuts while the other shouldn't is it's not sensical just because you know that doesn't make it so they forget they I personally don't think a government should have gotten involved in marriages in the first place but because they have you you can't sit here and decide that two gay men don't get tax cuts and a man and a woman do that's wrong from a governing perspective I agree with you 100% yeah that's a good one yeah that's a good one because that's one that gets slippery even Caitlyn Jenner isn't in a gay marriage which is fuck you know yeah I have cousins that are gay like it's even though it's about the fact internet I found I'm anti LGBT which is insane but I just think that since the government has stepped up and decide it's going to be in a if it's the governing body everyone should have a right to the same taxes why they shouldn't be shouldn't be that's the real problem but nobody talks about that power there's everything you you have to get married through the government you can't be taken from the government that's right guys for the government your tax cut you know you get you can check certain boxes when you do your taxes because you're married so since the government is doing that there's no reason why if two guys live in the same you know same house that they should not be allowed to get tax cuts so the difference it's the separation of the church in the state right well the state has taken on something that traditionally was in the church and because it has you have to be look at it objectively despite your personal feelings and look at objectively and every every person has a right to so get a tax cut because they married the person that they love well I'm a hundred percent with you on the the gay marriage thing so what other ones don't you agree with I don't even think about like wing talk okay so first off the chance just hilarious oh it's funny just jump in it you know but so the number one thing so my whole shtick the only time I snap back or get upset is because I'm really focused in the back community dude and the the committee has been affected the most by illegal immigration is a black community it's just a fact I mean you talk about low-wage workers the people that are the most unimportant company are young black men between the ages of 18 and 21 right so they have been negatively impacted by the influx of people running over the border because they'll come here and they'll say okay well you were gonna pay this guy $7 you know whatever the minimum wage is we'll do it for less and that directly impacts the black labor force so I you know I I recognize that we very much have an immigration problem I think that the immigration you know they talk about diversity it's not diverse whatsoever 1/2 of the immigrants that we take into from Mexico that's not that's making America Mexico that's a problem if you want to take in some more from from Africa that'd be great only only 3% come from Africa or I think 4% last year came from Africa tougher commute tougher commute right but the truth is that the argument that is behind people that are like so Pro immigration and against the wall is that it's about diversity is not about diversity if it's about diversity let's go look around the country and actually make a diverse there are tons people I live in Africa that work there asked off that allowed opportunity in America and we need to work that system out just because they have a agio advantage here doesn't make it fair so I'm not I'm Pro coming up with a solution for immigration because it's negatively impacted so much for president Candice that's what I'm hearing for president I'm hearing people going crazy and chanting you need out like let's just do it let's like what would be my slogan make America great again so he took it keep making America better yeah even better even even better even more better yeah no but these piece of the things that so anything like in every situation you'll see this if you watch like Charlie and I live on campuses let me do this every situation when I'm asked my opinion my answer is tailored towards the black community because I just think that we have really gotten this shit end of the stick do you write a lot of this stuff a lot of these thoughts out are these locked in your head locked in my head I read I make cards like to just remember certain person to watch yeah and I just do that like it was kind of weird you out that a couple years ago you were liberal and now you're not just a conservative but you're on all these fucking cable network shows and yeah you're constantly talking about it you're the voice and a lot of people look at you as like the hope for the future you get a good-looking 28 year old woman who's super articulate and smart and you could rattle off facts and statistics and talk real good on camera we got one got a good one you know that's what they look mean anyone young and vibrant that's what every political party looks toward right like you know whether it's on the left or the remain the constant looking for somebody on the Left they're looking right now we need someone to go against from Charley Booker we need someone we need someone Charlie he's a really bizarre he's just an actor it just doesn't come across this authentic to me but whatever yeah i am i do not like cory booker I don't like him whatsoever yeah he could be personally but he's probably publicly he's representing himself fictitiously in my opinion that's just my opinion no stop attack what if he knows how to go on the attack no I just like I've just it's the language I really don't like when people sit on a stage and go where's Justin Rogers in racism it's just like it's to me it's insulting to people's intelligence talks about coming about what's going on black community you don't need to scare them like it's the fear politics pisses me off and that's they do every four years it's fair politics welp you gotta vote for us because racism race and racism if it's not that's manipulating us that's using fear to control what we do okay we have a right to just be presented with the facts and being allowed to make it on our own that's that's my really perspective that's the big thing that's been so controversial can Assange thinks that the black community should be spoken to about what's going on in their communities it shouldn't be thrown jay-z and Beyonce concerts allah hillary clinton right but like that is that really that controversial of a thought it's it's broken the internet i go out and i say hey i think that there might be a little more to the story than everybody's racist and they go oh my god like she can't say that i'm not the first black conservatives i don't know why i'm the most like controversial that this has turned into like yeah you're good-looking conservative articulate person find me another young one yeah how many god i don't know young whip-smart fast with the tongue and i do want to say this i think that the people like on the left they say oh it's just because like she's a blocker let's agree with them it's like no it's because for the first time someone has the audacity first time doctor you know I met with secretary ben Carson last week lovely man lovely manage time money or something seems like a nice guy he is brilliant I threw out all that shit when people were hating on him and angry damn never losses cool never imagined he and I meeting and I'm like the lake knock them down like let me I'm a brain so we're just like that's what you want though for a dude is operating on brain yeah yeah yeah like here's we gonna do and we just like love each other like I mean like it was just a love affair like I he it was I didn't realize that I was so intellectually uninspired my whole life because I was in a room of people that didn't understand me and I never realized how on how misunderstood I felt until I got into a room with like secretary ben Carson and he just like got me and and Armstrong Williams he was a close friend of his and he just like got me and Kanye West right like who they just they get me and it's it's been so inspiring and I'm so happy and I don't think I've ever been this happy in my entire life that's why it's hard for me to ever take a negative perspective on anything really except for global warming because I'm like I feel so alive like I'm I feel vivacious and I I see the change happening the black mirror on like all you have to do is be an individual I do not tell I don't go on canvas and say vote for Trump I don't say you need to be a Republican I actually have tons of problems Republicans people just don't ask me you know and they assume I'm a Republican they assume I'm a registered Republican that's just not true I and I fully support the president I love the guy I don't know what to say I love President Trump I love his son I love Don Trump jr. I love Eric I love Ivanka and that's controversial I don't know how to love them they're great they're great people I want you to meet them because they're when you can't not like I'm like think about like doctor like terribly wrong I'm this could give this to go bad but think about like doctor drew like this is a guy with friends of mine I know he's supposed to come in here we're supposed to play techno hunt yeah I have a video archery game and he helped he's like you know really like a grizzly bear out in the wilderness in nature it's just like they've got a really like unfair shaking the media you shine like the spokesperson I love them it's authentic for a job no I'm not I don't know I've actually explicitly said I don't want to work on the administration what if someone came along I said we got a sweet deal for you no I've already been offered people I just say everybody knows who thinks oh she's pining for I've been offered shows everything that you think that I've been off but I'm going to towards I've already been offered I'm actually believe in what I'm doing and I'm building my own company I believe in it super ambitious I don't want to work ray buddies and you have confines let's say I went in for example worked for CNN or Fox News right then I can't say david hog kind of sucks but that tweet I would have had to remove about Chelsea Handler all right outrage machine the best thing ever is when Jake's like to leave it I'm like haha sweet it you can get away with it like Samantha she did the right thing by apologizing she made the right action yeah take the correct action yeah she did she took she'd made the correct action but what's so good for me is I'm free I say whatever I want and then they say delete it and I retweet it okay by the way that's what that's to me that's freedom like that you can't bike that's the best part of this is that I'm truly free I can say whatever I want I don't have advertisers that you can boycott like it's just I can say it my whole to my Twitter feed is just me that's that is a very powerful thing yeah I feel so it's a very good thing you know and I'm sure your ideas I mean you there's no better way to have your ideas expressed than to have no one that you were beholden to no boss yeah I love that and that's why it was like you know I start working for Charlie then I build my own company and now he's a part of my company and now we work for each other and it's just like we're mission or mission driven and I do support the president I don't I don't want her the work administration that seems like a really the worst job in America that's what I'm saying to be the secretary or oppressive no no no I mean particularly this administration is got it because they've they're so angry and bitter about losing like that time 2024 comes around you know it'll be a little different but they've just been like oh like they're just like it's it you can sense it they're angry like definitely an ideological war going on yet it clouds a lot of thinking and who's winning I know you tell me who's gonna we're winning we you're a Republican now no can you just sit there cause we know we're winning the independent thinkers that people don't think yes II see okay I'm just talking sit exactly you're Republican now no people that have this mentality the people that are our freedom driven I just want to be able have different ideas and that's why I snap back at you know conservatives too I'm like I'm not a product of the right don't think like I don't have people to go Oh Candace is destroying the left and she wants to create a model if on the right no wrong all I want Mikey would do is understand you have a right to like certain ideas on both sides but you don't like what you should never allow us for someone to use your identity to find how you have to think you should always be the person to finding how you think that's the message I say on college campuses that's a very good message hey Candace we could probably talk for hours but I gotta get the fuck out I gotta watch my o me now you're going away home yeah right now you gonna hang out with Kanye on the ranch maybe maybe yes that's what she's doing he's gonna go ride horses and shit you're a firecracker good luck to you I really enjoy talking to you we'll do this again sometime absolutely thank you thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
