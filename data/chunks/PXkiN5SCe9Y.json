boom and we're live with my pal Finney Sherman an eight-time world muy Thai champion Liam Harrison yeah fuck you yeah great to be here great to see ya a little bit listen man I'm a big fan of all combat sports but I really believe that if there's one sport that doesn't get it to do its Muay Thai I really don't understand why it hasn't taken off in America I don't get it I love boxing boxing is a lot of fun I think muy Thai is twice as fun yeah it's twice as hard as well I think I mean I fought pro boxing and I've under over under Muay Thai fights it's definitely a lot harder I mean is getting more mainstream now along with the MMA because most the top and Mia fight is are doing Muay Thai for the standup but it's still not where it needs to be yeah it's weird right yeah I mean I think what puts a lot of people off my tie is the maybe the two-minute break and also the break in between rounds yeah and the traditional music and stuff like that people find that hard to take to really which is I mean I love it so I don't see that problem but I can't see outside the box with that as well so I feel like the two-minute break gives guys more of a chance to recover it makes the fights more exciting you have more energy and I don't care about the the dance the Wai Kru that doesn't bother me if you go to fun on their martial arts funding to sit down and baseball baseball it's crazy how boring it is a lot of shows in England now they start to cut out all the traditional stuff there's no Ramona don't know why crude you get the ring you face off Bell goes go straight away sort of trying to cook little aspects of it out just to make it more media for em but fun fun friendly range yeah we should probably explain to people that don't know what we're talking about though the dance that they do it's called the Wai Kru right yeah they're my and it's what's what is the headband they put on was that the monk on that's the Mong Kong and when you're doing the dance the idea is like to warm up yeah there's lots of different real aughts of different reasons why these different counts believe different things student mainly to do with Buddhism sealing the ring and then taking you know the plane respects you Jim your coaches your parents yeah I mean I enjoy doing it it's all prepares me men for what's about to happen and I've done it in Eliot all my own dream eight fights only the odd one or two where I've missed it when that's only being because I've been told by the promoters right no wrong way I enjoy doing it but like Vinnie said like some people who come watch it they just want to see fights they don't want to see that aspect of the sport as well they just want to see people getting torn up and in case anybody didn't catch that through that dense accent he just said a hundred in eight fights that's fucking crazy man that's a lot of fight it is for a westerner but a lot of the ties I'm coming across there are two hundred three hundred plus I remember last year I fought a tie and they said all Liam's at a hundred fights that is a lot what do you think and he said and Holland rifice when I was 15 years old and I was sick demo said that allow it so a hundred five minutes fifteen how's it impossible I'm not sure 52 weeks a year living isn't it so yeah if they don't wait they don't in Thailand if you don't fight you know eight so so yeah there's no welfare or anything like that so do you have to do that I had former UFC champion Pat Miletich in yesterday and we were talking about Muay Thai and how crazy it is that this one place Thailand developed this completely effective style like they changed the way people fight I mean they really did did you look at all the other martial arts whether it's karate or kung fu or anything else like they figured it out yeah well but what's something now is as well the Westerners are starting to catch him up now I mean remember the first time I went to Thailand not many people will go in and not many people know about fighting that's why we're more and more Westerners now we're going to live there to stay in there for long periods of time to get any down and we I can compete with the top level Thais now Wow before I like back in the day there might have been like only Rahman Decker Danny Beal obviously John Wayne path them guys but now there's a lot a lot especially around year French fighters top level British guys we've got Danny McGowan in England he's doing it I mean we are starting to really compete with people on top with top level now is more time more popular in Europe than it is in America yeah there's massive shows on in Europe every weekend really I mean and in America dislike the main ones lion fight yeah we've got like two or three huge promotions in England now yah cow the tanker the French they have massive shows on every weekend with top top-level fighters on all over Poland then every everywhere he's getting he's getting huge I'm a big fan of lion fight but it seems to me that there's a lot of times where these guys come over and they're fighting someone that really doesn't belong in there with them and you get to see like alert Zilla or something like that that would be absolutely ridiculous fight against the guy was at 405 the best Thai champions of this era he were yeah and his first ever professional more time ripped off yes Yoko and everything else you know they do it in such a way that the matchmaking Brian called reduce a much making our friend the fights are like really real always always competitive which I really enjoy and you've been doing commentary for them for how long I've been doing commentary for yoke out since 2011 i'm estefan√≠a and when I was working for It's Showtime and she asked me to work for them I still have some of the old It's Showtime on my old I have a DVR and my gym that's like a fucking 10 years old and I still have your voice right yeah you know what I was gonna say as I've matured but after the shenanigans we've got in the past you'd be surprised but no it's an you know your car's gone from strength to strength you know and it's show time off shoots like glory and and infuse you know I work for now you know it's so healthy at the minute yes so healthy kickboxing and moist eyes well it's so high level it's just to me I mean I've sat down thought about this alone by myself for hours on end trying to think like what would be the way to get more time more popular in America because me as a person who loves combat sports I look at my tie and I'm like this is the pinnacle of striking sports it's the most exciting to me I like the clinch I like the elbows I love kickboxing I love glory but I feel like there's something missing with that like just the stuff that you were showing me today with all the trips and sweeps and all that stuff that's eliminated from glory the thing I think is with Liam as well though because he's got such he's got a fron friendly style you know he's not particularly a clincher is crush bang wallop and 150 mile-an-hour and I mean I'm not gonna lie I'm he biggest fun I mean if you listen to the common traits totally a hundred percent biased I mean I've known this 15-floor look how well he's lying down great smashing it but you know for me it's a style that makes it exciting yes I think the TV thing I think to get more popular need to pick and choose what fights you're putting on the TV yeah if you just put like a random show on with like free like fights that are terrible but ones okay you need to instead of it being live maybe like pick and choose some good fights get out there get people talking about it make up Vic Wow did you see that see them elbows see all that blood see them sweeps that's why you know yeah that's what that's what I do personally but I feel like if a network like Fox took a chance and had one Saturday night and they promoted it and that we're gonna show you the most dangerous stand-up strikers on the planet Earth like you might think that professional boxers are the most dangerous strikers but they literally wouldn't last two rounds they get their legs kicked out from under them they'd get need in the body and elbowed in the face they'd get cut up and clenched and thrown to the ground it's just a better style of fighting and a guy like you have TV would be a whole lot of fun I'm a big fan of the way fight man you've you fight like you got rabies I've always thought that that type of style but you know what and sometimes I've probably lost fights on points because of going wanting to go for the kill when probably I better change my game plan I probably could've won but that's just not what I'm about I get in there people coming to watch me fight and paying the router and money to come and watch me fight they wanna see me smash someone's leg they want to see me knock someone out they want to see even if it goes a distance they want to see me put it all in there people are paying their money for that so I feel like I've got a moral obligation to give him that I mean I can't fight technical as well about lots of fights in the past where I've just gone in with that game set and I've won schooled top-level fighters but I don't like doing that I want to get in there and I want to I want to yeah I don't like you doing that either I'm not gonna you know you don't face technically listen we can't do any wrong give my eyes you know I mean I can't you know I mean Oleum screams kill the family for nothing if they musta done but no I just I just think that you know his style the way that the show that we work I work on regularly Yoko I mean to have that level of it's much making seeing which eyes like anything if it's done well it's beautiful it was done badly states rights absolutely boxing I think you know like one of the reasons what we're talking about the dynamic golovkin Canelo Alvarez fine I mean one of the reasons why we're so looking forward to the fight not just because the first fight was so great because stylistically look at the way those two guys fight like how could this be a bad fight it's impossible nakai now the bull and the good of all changed different game plan the stuffings got everyone thinking again aren't well what's gonna happen this time there's no gonna change if someone's gonna get hit and it's gonna be guns blazing team GGG looking for him of a day at Big Bear yeah restaurant where he's where I came over said all what would you like when I was in there we were sat down and limbs like across from me and I went there's Tom Lafleur and he went news manager and then we getting all chairs out and stuff and saying these chairs out for and I thought oh so excited I've approached me for that phrase internal no well he met freight ropes a day before Freddie roses ask Warren what a guy yeah he's a real sweetheart yet he took us down let's watch sparring and stuff and we were like yeah we won't even that least I stood with his flat half an hour who talking about boxing he were like interested in when I will fighting and stuff uh he didn't have to be like that you know I mean and I bet he gets people walking in there or time like wanting him and stuff but he took time out talking to Vinny about all different other types of fights letters watched some top-level fight aspire and you're like really interested like absolute legend he's very genuine I got to interview him back when he was training George st. Pierre when George team Pierre was under him and he's just as down-to-earth is you or you or anything you know it's a regular guy yeah amen talk about a guy's been around the world and seen it all that guy you know training Pacquiao and fuck man and you know I thought he said something about don't want a Pacquiao is gonna train with him for this fight and he kind of likes and he was so engaging in endearing about Pacquiao wasn't he say no Pacquiao plays basketball even though he's been with him 16 years and he's just gonna well if he goes and does something else all he fans know which any was like oh well yeah it's just that he don't give a fuck he's got money his nap shit and you know I mean his health has been such an issue over the last few years he has trauma related Parkinson's yeah which has got to be very interesting when you're you know training fighters and you realize like you're suffering from fighting yourself yeah yeah just me and him that's med mile trip meeting him and just seeing how grounded and down-to-earth is honestly I just couldn't believe it have you got a wild card Jim yet watch them come to what were his name George combo so jr. yeah they get from us watch out for him guy 14 and all oh yeah definitely it's crazy too when you go up to that gym you hear so much about it you like it's about as big as this room yeah he was sweating it on the way up yeah yeah no it's it's a legendary spot yes great so you're in America doing some seminars yeah yeah fire fury focus seminars Vinnie's doing all his NLP mind coaching stuff for an hour and a half and then I take over and do all the physical aspects Muay Thai all the little tricks and sweep some of this stuff I was sewing showing you their stuff that I've used for up my career to help me get to where I'm where I am an NLP is neural linguist linguistic programming so doing yeah and I'll pace but it's mainly to language and things tricks that I've put up from over the years not all and LP you know a little bit of hypnosis hypnotic language blah blah blah right right and it gets them in the learning state so what I do is I get a prepare them and learning state give them confidence build them up so they can start to take on what Liam teachers so they said double-whammy really so he seats you some brilliant techniques as you're aware and then I just do my bit to get them where they have to get soon before I met you I thought that hypnosis was for idiots getting me with that shit and then when you hypnotize me I was like wait a minute this is real Wow but what it's I try to explain it to me to people you know I'm like it's not what you think it's not like you don't know where you are you don't know what's going on all sudden your pants are off it's not like that it's like you achieve this weird state of mind you're weird to me yes also I do is guide it you to it and then the client does it like whether I do it with you or actors we've got an actor friend called Mike Parr it we've been working with he loves it and what and brown people we was out to help his acting yeah he mentioned me on the program call this morning which is a daytime show in England and he went on it's in a soap opera called Emmerdale he's normally him a long time and no need less time because I know he's your biggest fan by the way hey Mike met his year yeah so yeah and we don't work with him and since we're going on your show which I have to really do appreciate it because my works gone from business Woman of the Year CEOs and everyone now been Easter spit it's just gone crazy because you needed to convince her and use it so thanks very much well it's legit I'll tell you right now I mean I don't know about other people but you know how to do it thank you again it gave me some very interesting understanding about the mind and thought processes and how it works and that expression that you looked like to use all the time huh kalau Wow I think about that explain what that is - people chuckle always uh increasing your peripheral vision its current its increasing your awareness just by basically cutting off your chest a chance' that goes on in your mind if you see Liam when he fights before he fights he pushes his gloves together mhm and goes into hot clouds is every single time what that does when I am showing you that yeah but I will show you later on if you wish is you anchored the gloves so you anchor a positive state in the gloves and you push them together and you find hackle out and it just gets you in a well what's unique about these seminars 'is what I wanted to do with me because I've worked with myself before and all the stuff that he's teaching and not I know it works myself first time I used Vinnie is a historic are we all started I fought a top-level tie called uh no Macau summary in a nickname with iron hands as I am yeah like an eight percent ko ratio and I went to fight him in Jamaica I know what could be him there are few aspects that you think alright we're training a dingo right at a time really fuck my shit up it fucked you up Michael Jackson died oh yeah massive fun really were you a massive massive you ever come out to his fights yeah but yes I fought this Thai champion in Jamaica like is there a few things didn't go right any smashed me to pieces they were the first time I ever got stopped um I knew I could be you know I'm good at reading fighters I knew I could be him so I begged and begged and begged for the rematch and promoter bro about six seven months later I brought him to England M en arena massive sure biggie showed the country's ever seen and we need sports me before in the past said you don't never do want to do a little bit work I know it's fine our mentally strong a mentally strong I don't need sir but you build up to that fire for you know what I'm gonna train his idly always as I've ever done before anyway it was an odd point you can never be too prepared I said I've been here can we do a little bit and we did we did lots of different techniques and we have like key words like warrior were one of them warrior was the main one here and bear in mind now the reason why Lee was reluctant to work with me it's the first time he met me I stole a wheelchair drunk just for everyone Oh fucking Brits I was drunk a show at least sound all I'm Shirley's coach Richard Smith remembers or Lisa and anyway so it was reluctant because I like to mess of our you know I like to be silly etc you know but he came to me in and we work together and my take on this story is I was common saying at the time with the great guy called Rob Cox who lives in San Jose about boys I Rob Cox knows every food everybody's that got the kink simple and I was commentating with him now Liam came to me and and I waited to put a word in that would that would that keep him strong so it was warrior now it was really weird as that was commentating on that you can watch on YouTube when I'm commentating on the fight he looks at me at round four because I can see him and he looks through his trainer richard smith and andy house and his cousin who's a five-time world champion as well so it's in her family and he looks over at me and he goes warrior he looks straight in my eyes i don't remember doing that over it were like that the state I was in when or fighting he couldn't hurt me bearing in mind up badly smashed me a pieces in the first fight I didn't get hurt with anything I'll just like her in some total stay or so on point I'll make any miss i schooled him really i beat him pretty convincingly on points that's amazing and i went to the after part yeah afterwards added bottle of water sat down passed out collapsed ambulance came and got me told me it was bill had about really bad concussion Wow but these girls like the state I was in in the fight and I didn't feel a thing everything just I my eyes didn't feel any people we like I also explained so emotionally invested in as well that when it gives you know I'm loose piggy start when it came over he said thank you that day as well so there were a lot his family in that and I was so overwhelmed by it but look I mean it's only one aspect of it he's got a fantastic coaching Richard Smith and Lisa hall at Lisa Smith Lisa you should we go on Lisa and all the gangs like Jordan bats yeah you know Andy everyone Steve Campbell Eastern physician he's got so many people around him I'm just one little bit but it was weird because he when he went warrior and I said seems you member same where he went no if you had a didn't remember I look back at the video the concussion probably had a lot to do that maybe yeah the video on the left looking around for my head nearly like spin grounding that was the windup probably yeah yeah you know it's interesting that that's catching on mental coaching it really is and there's a lot of fighters that used to dismiss it that I know now are using mental coaches I've had conversations with them before in the past and I was like what do you think about sports psychologists we think about Manticore I don't need that shit and then years later a loss or two later their minds in a weird place and then they decide okay I need something like that I say the thing is I think that fights are wooden lost in the changing rooms I think that in the locker room is you say you know one little it's like a little tiny bit of anthrax thrown in a reservoir of poison hole say I think that's what it was mentally I've seen fighters in the dressing room who I've trained with in the gym and they have been so strong had so much power in the gym they've been the best ever and I've seen him in the changing rooms and I've seen him start to go out herself he couldn't be happy in it you know strong him in it and I can see I'm just dying to play and change and a lot of Fighters to have that problem and dwarfed by the moment yes yeah yeah that's a common thing with everything I think with any kind of performance anything were you doing something that's difficult but fighting has such dire physical consequences that the the overwhelming anxiety and the pressure just you see it so many times guys who are really good fighters that they have panic attacks in the dressing room they just can't handle it's like interviews as well I mean get such a diverse mix of clients but it's everything is what it means to you isn't it so that your fight against whoever they are these fighters tie box in the world that they keep matching you with and and your job or you your interview or or you like Mikey that the lines that you have to do while you show it I think it's all relative to you you know when anxieties is a big skirt anytime you have to do anything difficulty I'm sorry to come to yet play but it just doesn't come into play in anything remotely could accept war it's like war is like the highest level of it and then past you get below that is like probably police officers and you know first responders then it's fighters indeed it's like there's nothing like that that walk to the fucking ring you know I mean and you're just thinking about did I do enough did I sleep enough did I eat right you know yeah and you see yeah I see so many I think that's why I've kind of got into it as well you know we do with different things that I saw so much potential yeah you know the first time one of the first times I met him I was training someone to fight him and I was like right listen he's only a kid so what you got to do get in his face and punch him in the face art as often as you can eel soup quick how long was I only 15 who's the other guy well 28 oh Jesus my Castellon not from Liverpool yeah you fought a fucking 28 year-old when you're 15 right I fired 65 kilo now my first fight we're at 60 kilo when I'm 14 so I've always been big for age and then when I got to 15 and stopped growing so I went on 14 I had like a beard and I look like a Yeti and also I said I was a big in school so I'm having to fight a lot older people I'm gonna fight men and so I would like my finger when I'm 14 one of my first fights without any protection on that's about 28 year old and I went my first 29 pro fights all unbeaten he want until I fought a Thai champion and I got a bit of an I didn't call you could do well that I realized oh I have to change up my again plenty enough to go Thailand didn't like learn how are you doing what is the difference what is the difference when you when you train in England versus when you train in Thailand and how they fight what is the difference well over there I stayed there for my 18-month in Thailand and I just lived in the gym like the Thais did so woke up in the morning we went running came back bad where clinch not too intense in the morning but in the afternoon session free in the afternoon the scorching hot II free till 6:00 I mean most classes in England I might want an hour an hour and a half these were three hours intense he keeps the second workout of the day yeah yeah so you're skipping for half an hour straight off of that straight on the pad seven eight rounds straight flat straight inspiring straight flat straight and a clinching with the ties and anyone who knows how strong the ties are clinching as well it was absolute torture every single day and but I loved it and I don't think about doing that I would often got to being able to compete with the top level ties that I have done now though how much richer does project progressed with my gym in England I feel like we've got so many top level fighters now that who are at that level I feel like I don't have to go over there and do it anymore mm-hm we've got the stable in bad company we've got the knowledge we've got the experience we've got the Andy out in Jordan Watson young Joe Kraven coming through we've got all these strong strong animals in the gym that ham will probably want to well we are we have been one of best gyms in the area for a long time now now do you work out the same amount of time do you do a morning session and then do a three-hour afternoon session - yeah so what I'll do in the morning I'll go down I'm probably the kick pads with my boss Richard and maybe a bit of play sparring with Jordan are run so then in the evening I've got Petey's all day in between this that's the only different personal training yeah yeah I teach as well one full time of five hours of pts to do in my tween all this is exhausting yeah is is especially the way you teach yeah you get very intense I'm I like to be hands-on and there are to get involved and it's tiring I just have to make sure let me die at some point we stuff lab because if I have a day where I eat shit and then I'm exhausted and then I get the most out of my second training session and then it'll get to five o'clock I'll go run again kick pads again and that's when Richard will do like so you run twice in a day some days Wow yeah daughter and father I'll do more 5 5 KS but fast the way I see it we move tights explosive stuff so I do my I do more hill sprints and more sprint work so a long distance the only time I do my really long distance is the funny head trauma head down drastically but we when you fight in five three minute rounds it's not a long time it's like Bam Bam bang so I do more explosive work like hill sprints from my strength coach and stuff like outlaw plyometric explosive workouts that's the only thing that's missing in Thailand really the strength and conditioning but a lot of gyms out there now are getting hold of that and changing up their super pros doing it Perico Roberts amazing and Shirou new strain la just said that Alistair Overeem's over there and bad and bad has been there a few times a lot of the Dutch come over there in Koh Samui and that they've got of CrossFit place now they've got like a new sort of meta fit there's a lot of them attached you know you know and and you know doing it over there as well so the the kind of catching I know that bunch a Mac and all that yeah because he looks like he does a lot of it yeah yeah us fight against Johnny risco and he lost Johnny risk was amazing that night it was just on him didn't give him any respite how long ago was this about week one last week let's bring house book are now 35 he's coming to the Twilight now yeah yeah yes yes I got a chance to see him fight in LA yeah when they had they've had some fights they tried to do some pay-per-view events and stuff like that out here it's just for whatever reason it never caught on yeah we did a boy sign America and II fall twice on it and that's all they were good shows every a real good fire a wicked show that's why I'm at Brando Blues our friend dudes looks after us here and then Fontana California in the house yes last one and yeah it was a shame because we love it don't we yeah I wish I really wish we could I could figure out a way to get it to catch on I just don't understand what's wrong yeah I guess it is getting there with it with the MMA and stuff I remember the first time I have a fault main event on a show in England and I got like paired like this much but now I'm a headlining shows and I'm getting paired like up there now so there's a lot of people I've seen going nowhere it's going nowhere he's bringing that Micra frontier I've watched it like go from there right to where it is now in my career and where it's come from he's massive he's massive gap from where it was never it does keep going like this it will eventually get there but it's just slowly slowly slowly we've always seen much more and more type talent come out of England and out of Europe then we have out of America for whatever reason there's been some standout fighters in America but it's the big shows there's like a lot of big shows in Europe and that just really never been a case here yeah I mean like like yo cow is the one now everyone wants to fight on your cow I'm nothing to do with the promotion I'm just do your cow fire and I get people messaging me all the time oh how do I get to fight on your cow who do I contact and I'm on I mean like hundreds of messages all the time of people asking everyone does that's the show that everyone wants to be honest the biggest outside of the main stadium ones in Thailand the biggest in the world by a country mile do they do internet pay-per-view no they don't and I think that's something they should look at yeah yeah I've said this rig yeah because I think because even even though it's big it's small that makes sense in numbers that come to it come to the show it's like 3,000 or something like that which isn't massive but he's always jump act and I think is when you're selling tickets for a show people say oh I can buy it for like five quid and watch us know there may be a G yeah yeah yeah geo block because another infusion do that who I work for see you're black what do you mean that this means that you can't watch it in your country but everyone else in America so that people will go to the to see it yeah yeah yeah so where does it air in digit air on television like no wait eats a bring the we do the show and then they put the fights out and they kind of feed the fights out over YouTube yeah I think they may put it on their Facebook page or what the fights on that show every single fight is a war every single fight could headline any Shore we have gone round the world we have got some right kids coming through I'm a massive father there's never a boring show is there no ever and Eve even when Liam's not on it which is you know obviously the highlight for makes me make and he brings he brings thunder doesn't he's a storm we've got some new kids coming through that I just like I just mentioned Stuart Stabler and these Joel Craven and this these kids coming through that I just watched him taking on this style and taken on their own style and there's some real dangerous kids coming free now I would imagine with your style it's your style so physically intensive and so aggressive that like your how well do you monitor your diet I have to do we've gone um close to a fight if at all like I say I've got I'm gonna have no energy and without we yeah I used to call a lot more than I do now I might do about eight pounds now but I might start the fight camp and be only ten pounds over that's not no it's not no not a long haul my last four or five fights the day before the way he never been on we're without hoping it's getting its own or oblong having to go running the sweat sewer and a feelin huh as I've got older I've got wiser yeah I you really just realize it was draining you too much yeah of course especially as I got older when I were younger I could get away of it I might be again so on and lose like freefall keel or the wane and still get in there and knock someone out or stop someone but as a I had a few little mistakes as like olders now growing when I missed weight and made me just think what am I doing here get on point with it because sooner you start to do so flap Romar's don't want to work with you right you get a bad rep and then this were about seven eight years ago now and Anthony I've done it since I've made sure I been on point of everything to be honest it's down to me my missus a lot as well she looks after me and she goes out and works out all day but whenever I get in from Jim about half seven eight o'clock there's healthy food there for me and stuff and what what kind of food ye do you specify not like a lot of people cut out carbs and stuff I'm training so hard and sweating all day and burning so much calories in the PJs and stuff I don't need a car my carbs that's a big factor like people need to understand that when they're talking about low carb diets it really dependent upon how much exercise you yeah if you're running twice a day and you're doing three-hour workouts in the afternoon like you're gonna need some car behind yeah exactly I don't need to cut them out even in the last week a lot of people were saying oh it's last week fight camp waiting's coming up honey a cut my cows out I'll still get up in the morning a massive bowl of porridge I still have rice for my dinner and my fish in my salad and stuff LA as well I don't need to cut you out but like set us down to how much work I'm doing the amount you're burning I mean Jesus Christ amount of calories you must be burned well I have my name and my watch on over there and I think I almost nearly five thousand Oh somewhat ridiculous and over $1,000 all day from betraying how many pts and stuff like that that's insane you just think about eating five thousand yeah yeah that's crazy so with you do you limit the amount of personal training you do because the light gets closer if I'm not gotta fight when we know pile on a train once a day just to keep sharp or keep on top top of me game I might be I do seven or seven hours in like no problem and then but as a fight get closer and cross so I'll cook down and cut down and cut down because obviously I don't my body being tired I need to be I've got a lot to lose out every time I fight right I've got my mom I can spread this is a brand now with these seminars stuff as well so I need to make sure I'm going in there as OnPoint as I can be so you think about it that way you don't think about you think about it as like Europe basically a business yeah yeah of course yeah and I've got a lot I've got a lot riding on it every time I fight I think that has been for a long a long time now I mean loud all the country gets behind me puts a lot of players out there as well I want to see me lose and they love it when I lose an end yeah well there's no getting around that man if you're doing well there's gonna be people exactly and a lot of it really they just hate themselves that's really what there you go I mean what it is is they see someone who's out there is exceptional and that makes them compare their own life to this guy who's out there smashing buddy 108 fights and they go fuck that guy I see kicking the pansy over there and some I got about four or five actually but the four or five comments that I know is saying kicking that wrong how far'd you click on the profile just have a look em you're all just Selfridge himself eating chocolate bars and one of them of a dog throw about 175 kilo day I was holding boxing pads for Liam Ollie's out I just old boxing pests are there and so much you drop you dropping your left handers like alright then thanks fucking know if you ever have a fight you're gonna get knocked out as a hundred night fight it's just hilarious that some would actually say to you that you're kicking wrong I give anybody all my friends out there they get flustered by people criticizing them on social media I want to point them to that Liam fucking Harrison someone's telling him kicking that makes me want to cry that's how fucking stupid some people are but that just shows you that when you have an open forum where anyone can comment anyone can say something you're gonna run into a certain amount of those people around it yeah definitely you just can't you can't look at the comments you know you can't you can't read that shit and you just get assassinate from oh oh well the thing is those people they might not even mean what they're saying they just they're they're it's verbal diarrhea they're just black they're just angry they're upset and the thing is no even if I looked at someone's video and I fought that technique one on point or anything like that I wouldn't even go on and right yeah I mean right of course still gives you the right to go on and like try and put someone down as putting some dinner I mean it's just he's someone like that no maybe someone's getting undue accolades yeah any like strange shit like 420 pounds around eating burgers all day is ridiculous to I mean they can eat more than you though it's a good point maybe maybe not I've sit down with some fighters and you watch them eating you like the fuck is all that going you know I mean there's very few things in life that burn off more calories and throw up kicks you know especially the way you throw like that just amount of fucking energy you're generating yeah I mean I'm when I'm on the pods and stuff every training session I've dropped 100% especially when I'm on the pods I've had pad work is fucking awesome to watch it's very inspirational it's very fun obviously as well with that that's just a little clip of what I'm doing on the pods I mean my old pod work ain't just me tribe sometimes it's just me trying to master pods to pieces but obviously it's a lot more technical aspects right now that's just like a little clip rubber I look for what someone's filming ah that was good stop for it right Bob we see this bits where Richard stopping me putting me right while I'm doing wrong technique working the game plan is still out there obviously just little little snippet so I just put up with me doing things wrong apparently but that's obviously this is aspiring now the different technical side so as well as that work I mean that he's like my style but I don't fight totally just like that just smash smash smash have you got the level of fight if I just started smashing things like her I'm gonna walk on it with sure that's at that level it's gonna be game over yeah there's no way now do you in between fights do you train with people would that have other styles or different styles like maybe some kyoko-chan guys or someone who's doing something different I trade a lot of MMA fighters the minute I've got quite a lot of guys coming a million we got I've been doing a bit of work with my dear Casey from the UFC he's been training me a little bit means I'm in Florida now training there there's a gym in Leeds where I'm from called a VT like a real hotbed some top MMA guys out there I've got a young kid called Louie Lee Scott 17 years old seven and OH in MMA he'd been doing my weight I booked he's gonna be an absolute superstar in him and his style what he's got going on is so good because he's got the stand-up and that we were but we found like a medium to pull it into the MMA so his eyes are on point his movements on point but he still finds himself in the positions to land the Muay Thai strikes with all their power so generate the power and still be out there in fast enough and quick enough not to be getting taken down and losing balance and falling all over the place and so what out for him is going to be it's just time with MC k MH is a Mack the Knife global so I'm gonna be working with they've got boxer's so I worked with the manga side of that so they're getting on to it now but they've also gone into the MMA side feels fine whatever until you've signed them to look they got boxes they got Billy Joe Saunders who I know you like Tyson Fury and blah blah blah but they've also got an MMA site run by Karen Kendall and yeah they've just signed Louie Louie's exceptional well the UFC is now coming to Liverpool and hair until is gonna be my but he doesn't have a fight yet correct something comfortable yeah I'm hoping it's gonna be awesome on their talk tomorrow uma and him going back and forth on on Twitter that's that God gets no love come on loose Mon 7a no in the UFC smashes everybody everybody scared of him nobody calls him out I don't think yeah till I'm pretty sure till well be scared of him in a little bit till winning details they've been going back and forth yeah definitely what fight OB and the stand-up why still has a massive advantage and then on the ground loose Mon should have an advantage so it's it's a very interesting fight it was months a fucking tank to that guys fucking animal yeah I've not seen too much of him but it's gonna be scared of him yeah fights well that there you go who's smart is a fucking stud I mean that guy's no joke he he's like there's very few people calling that guy out what's he'll appeal of it not oh yeah it tells the one that's calling me there you go that leaf thrives on stuff yeah I've known since you were 16 years old and we used to be used to train together like more time back in age to come over my gym bag company Ruby's coach Jim used to work together and I'm part of a team and do bits with him and he's always at the hi Jude and I'm never been scared of anyone always I've been like yeah whatever bringing out bring out I believe him there hasn't been a single guy in the UFC with one fight that's got as much hype as that guy you know on fight fights Cowboys mashes yeah I mean you see what he did the cowboy the real deal is he's always been special he's one of these kids like when I seen him growing up he's one of these kids who just come to any special and I mean the city's behind him everyone cuz he comes to our gym when I train four corners to him with John gillies and Bali and all them in Macon and he comes down a stick she's adding but he doesn't train but I haven't trained that but he comes and sees us and he's a great guy but his coach Colleen Herron I grew up with kind of because we I was trained my icon to scan and we used to do demos and stuff because believe it or not I used to be alright and Colin was always a little bit better and since then he's got carbon-carbon Jim and he had the UFC fighters from Liverpool but he's now he's got this starring Daren in the whole city is it gets a bit like him in Leeds they just get swamped by people now was this when Darren was fighting more tired than became popular yeah well when he fought were tired anywhere you were always like one of the most naturally talented kids you would ever see if Simon all day that are different okay he used to come down to our gym and he'd have a fight coming up and he would just be wiping the floor with everyone it didn't even really train out about the neighbour used to come down every young kid he'd mess around it run run riot and then Brailey outlet rain but still turn up fight and win since then someone when that natural talent he's now got that dedication that I'd worked or some lose that naturally talented and who's gonna work that hard that's gonna be a fun southpaw yeah when he stepped in in car cowboy with that left elbow yes he stepped in and just just drove up that elbow and smash Cowboys knows you like wow that was fast cause distance so quick yeah what column is trainer he was a trained Mordechai Murdoch one is it like one Daquan yeah yeah he was like flat belly 11 or something like that and you know he's just call him takes no bullshit you know Colin just says that's the way it's a bit like Richard that's the way is that's what you got to do that's what you're doing and since that since Darren's out that influence in his life like Liam said and there was obviously the story about him going Brazil he's just has just been another level what makes a guy naturally talented like you take a guy like Darren till like when you say naturally talented like what is about a guy like that to just picks things up quicker I don't know it's odd to explain some people just walk in a bad company gym and they'll have two free lessons and they'll just be able to tell up that floor the movement the rhythm and stuff like Darwin like that ever since I remember when he first started remember his coach saying I've got this kid you need see him you need to come and look at him southpaw should see him kick he's only been training in a few months and I when I saw him I like looks like he's seasoned pro five six years of training with a plenty while walking now Jim a bad company and they'll come in they'll have a few fights and Wow yes alright this but as soon as it gets hard and the level steps open the realize how hard they have to work to actually compete at that level that's the end of them you don't really see him anymore and it's like the biggest waste of talent you've ever see we've had plenty like war fraud yeah he's not many tonight's not enough no no no not when you get level here's to a certain level when you can get yourself out of jail but when it levels steps up and everyone's working out and people who are as talented as you are working out then that's when you're gonna be in trouble that's why Aaron's gone off and done what he's done that's why and sure and what he's all about there's this class my youngest daughter she's 7 she takes martial arts takes this mixed martial arts class this is this five-year-old in this class and they're doing drills on their bag and I'm watching this five-year-old kick the back he's got his hands up high he's moving like this dad Fang turns the hip over perfect even a switch kick and I'm watching this five-year-old and I went over to his parents and I went if I was a strike if I was like a coach that was looking to recruit a fighter at a young age I grabbed that fucking kid like that kids special like there's something that he figured out at 5 at 5:00 all the other kids you're looking all the other kids in the class they're flailing their arms all over the place I paid attention up their babies like this his hands are glued right below his eyes like bang bang crack crack well my five our kids class at bad company I don't like training upstairs at the same time when they're on cuz all the technique is so good it's embarrassing sometimes you look at them only think like from 6 to 12 these are amazing but like I say it's only the ones that really want me who were really willing to put the work in we'll go from the next level and the next level the next level cuz a lot drop off no matter our talent not a lot of people like having to go at that place where you need to go right to get to a good level yeah he doesn't like people watching him when he can't do things well either like when he's learning thing he likes to go over in the corner and practice things on his own like very interesting and you watch like someone who's just got like a special inclination toward something a kid called Shay Williams from Liverpool and all the blokes at sock mines eight eight I'm friends with his dad make eight eight everyone's trying to make sure of all these guys you know these big sort strong me for Hana let me see now kids is for Humber alien age 8 years of age lovely kid but he's just one of these kids that can do everything got a components video on YouTube is that we saw the other day as well I'm too young the black American kids amazing see that yes Cochin what he was saying but the one holding the panel is right he knows more than most boxing trainers I've ever seen in my life he's like 5 years old exactly crate in the hand speed amazing yeah brilliant no best video I've seen yeah yeah absolutely amazing yeah that whoever fucks with that kid in school yeah they're in trouble that's a big problem maybe it's that kid that setting up thing saying you drop your left it's I think it's interesting today - as opposed to in the past that you can watch videos like that and then you know before you'd have to like watch a VHS tape and sit down and analyze it and pause it like now you could be at a fucking bus stop on your phone and you can watch world-class fighters instantly instantly the finger thing with that is as well though with the Internet as well as being at watch world classifiers instantly here's a kid what yeah that's him and his dad I guess look at that fucking technique unbelievable look it's incredible he ducks under I mean everything blocking punches fucking amazing and look at that he goes through the body that's crazy I mean he looks like he's four that's a different kid that's an even tinier kid yeah very impressive but yeah the thing with the Internet as well though what starting weapon although a lot in especially in the UK people are say right we try much you're sure right we've got a guy here it's at free fights your guys out free fights let's match him and they go oh no Jimmy's name I need to search him on you too many searches Facebook and he searched this so as well as being a blessing he's a curse for stuff LA because but when I start fighting every day richard has got on me I'd walk in the gym Richard go you fighting on Saturday this might be on Wednesday I go alright yeah well I turned up Saturday you have your fight but now it's like I only know his name he's Jim what's his Facebook isn't that a Badge of Courage to to be able to do that like that's something that people would always admire like a guy that would come into the gym and someone would say would you like to fight this weekend they go fuck you yeah martini money time anyway yeah I mean that that is what you're here for everywhere now James always been let down yeah gosh from Richard we've got a big junior circuit now we've got an jock our next generation how do you feel about that about little kids fighting they don't fight head contact no head contact yes I mean some of the kids we've got we got another kid who can't head kick either no it's really body some kids from like from Richards two sons they're familiar Fergus yeah we got Louis Joe Ryan ooh so what year would well Joe Ryan's 13 he's just for pro in Thailand and knocked out and I think an 18 year old type he fought pro in Thailand 13 last week oh my god they were there we've been but these kid is he special he's taller than me he's 13 he's taller than me why it's about 59 60 kilos I've done a lot of work with him one-to-one as well he's done an amazing job with him he's that about is the unbeaten him 36 price it was seemed I think he lost in a the f Marashi against a kid that was like 16 and he weighed four kilos heavier another kid called Riley Smith we've got sorry sorry we've got some right kids that are coming through Jonathan I get youse just been on your couch special that's 20 years old be a great fire veteran called - no what kind of program do you have for these young kids do you have classes based on age groups do you have classes based on weight classes or do you have kids classes well a but company gym the kids class is six to twelve year old there's about 40 or 50 sometimes in our kids classes and it'll be about three or four of the doing structures taking it fight is all I'll be open to ring fight training intermediate 3 in the middle begin it's down at the end so everyone's got someone caring for him open and bring through all the fighters are working together watching name is just like watching the mini version of all our fighters upstairs he's its class to watch sometimes I like just going and watching am ultra inspire each other and clinched in and helping each other and then a lot of them will stay behind after the class and really love putting the extra hours in the extra work and there it's good watching sometimes you'll see someone coming in the gym and little walking rash I then I look at him again two months later and I'll see him on the pass crop wow wow wow he's that looking around going yeah see that see him going through from being like walking it Jimmy is shy little 7 8 year old boy and then smashing the pads enough in the first fight our junior team is so good because obviously we've got Richard and Lisa training him but my cousin Andy is also a five-time world champion he's doing Petey's of a lot of them Joe Cravens only like 19 years old but he's so good with the kids as well so they've got a wealth of experience and like I said they're all going up up in the next minute they're up there fighting and just smashing it and I think we've got we had 18 fights for our junior team last week and I think we want someone like 16 so now I asked you earlier when we were working out together you you've never really considered fighting MMA no like I say it took me a long time to get where I am in Muay Thai and let's be honest dudes gonna stand up in front of a white ring I'd have to get my ground game so I'm so good right exactly a long time and to be honest I'm really enjoy of Muay Thai I love I love fighting Muay Thai and I think it could only be good at someone that you're passionate about if I got in there and I thought well I'll do this because there's a lot of money involved in it I don't want me I won't be where I am I I find more time to absolutely love it your style though it's really interesting it would apply very well yeah I mean like when I'm teaching the MMA fight as I do tre and I think I've got that good medium about the striking needs to be and without getting taken down and out off balancing yourself I'm not arrogant enough to go in there say right Muay Thai you need to do this in MMA you need to fight like a Thai and do that I'm not arrogant enough I know there has to be changes and I think I do support that well and it does work with the fighters are trained but like I said I love fighting weight I'll ask where my eyes and maybe if someone came over it you know there's loads of money do you want to maybe yeah but like it I'm I'm gonna stand a fire brighter have you done any wrestling or jujitsu I've always been so concentrating on my weight I fight great i'm always booked out all year i don't really get a fart about it before doing everywhere VT with Danny Mitchell but I'm booked our one fights I've got July August October November you're already booked I'm booked out all right to end the year you do that that many fights in advance yeah that's very different yeah year enough in advance Wow penciled in so I'm not grabbed no time anyways I need to stay on top of my own training just so I'm ready to go from one fight to the next and if you get injured I obviously I have to pull out I had to pull out I brought my foot in my last fight in Paris in December brought my foot split my shin and I couldn't fight in March I meant to fight two weeks ago obviously I couldn't do that one injuries are part of the sport are you back to kicking things now I'm back kicking hundred-percent and back as soon as I get back home I'll be back in Canberra ago in July that's impressive three months later he throwing hard kicks yeah yeah now when you started working with Vinnie what was what was the big difference like what's the big difference in doing this mind coaching and like would it what have you noticed improvement in my awareness like the stuff with the hakalo runabout and the anchor net yeah your awareness increases so when you anchor what do you what are you thinking when you touch when you smash your gloves together at the beginning of like I'm sure everyone it'll be different and what I'm doing is that when I'm pushing mine goes together all the stuff we've worked on like the hot cloud the awareness everything's all just coming to me the warrior he sticks with me that word will always stick with me after we've worked before I'm sure people have word to him and got different stuff that they're anchoring well that's what I'm anchoring when you say anchoring would you bringing it in and bringing it all back in we are all the stuff that we've worked on like when we did the ANA wat fight the warrior stuff we also had the Nova fight against Andre cool Ben I got Raw off by everyone in this fight he'd been to England twice before it knocked out two of our top guys in the way above me so I stepped up in where to fight him and I went and did a bit of work with Vinny then and there were a few key words that we said then one of them were visual visible damage and what were the other one hot knife robot a hot knife rubra a classic hot knife through butter so you guys in your goddamn accident you learned how American she's hot knife through butter so what said what so American oil it's pretty good said Tiffany's I said I don't want to beat these guys had everyone dry me off I said I want to smash him to absolute smithereens incoming the game plan he told me the game plan he already told me what he was going to do with and I told everyone now all gonna win yeah no one believed me yeah and then but I obviously because you know if you didn't mention it I'm his biggest fan and what we did I did a CD for him so I said listen to this CD before you go to bed so I recorded this this this CD and it was weird because I again I was commentating thankfully on it was on the main event wasn't yet Mary and I was watching it and it was like playing a video game because there's just like logic bank it was just like and everything that I and all the thing that I said kind of robot only one bang and he just maybe if you ever see it the absolutely destroyed could have been and Kuhlmann is a is a legendary fighter from Belarus and it was just it went down yeah every time I've picked him I could see all right in him and that's what will come into my head and again it's weird it's hard to explain unless you actually do work women's and but yeah it worked again perfect I know what work perfect that what was the game plan that people didn't believe I said whoever won I said I'm gonna stop him in free round and because he I will moving up him where and because he'd knocked out two over top fires in England from that way about not talking much Michael Dixon first round and I think he stopped in rankin as well and then I've told everyone I'm gonna stop him in town he said his legs his legs too straight so I'm a smash she's like I'm gonna stop him a little kicks he'll be and I said it'll be like a hot knife through butter and I stopped him being around freaking with low kicks now when you were creating this CD for him like what was the goal what was your objective he told me what he was gonna do so I reaffirmed that so we did like a trance thing where you go into you know you lead anyone into an induction and then just played out the fight in his mind telling him the specifics of what he told me and how he speaks because you have to use that language back to them if I said you know something that's not in their vocabulary of obviously I'm not saying you think so he's got to add lots of like you know what he told me in two into the CD so it and it went in it works I've never done it before it was a gamble I just thought you know what you know when it all cut seems like you could probably do that for a lot of people right i mean i different things that you're trying to work on if you could just like listen to it and like in your like on your earbuds or something like that you know i've been i have people now it worked with me for a year like clients that want to work me for ya they paid me for e and they just want to ring me and talk about stuff it's become like a real dot sort of different than hypnotherapy and just being a therapist in just that sorts that sort of way but yeah he's possible and look i the reason why we're doing this is because number one who ever said he's my friend but number two what we do works it's not Lisa tried and tested he's eight work times world champion I'm his mind coach you know vice he's got a great coaching Richard and everybody bought what we do works and people start to see the benefits the feedback we've got from like San Diego Boxing Club you know how time and Jesse and all them it's been mind-blowing isn't it well there's definitely good states of mind to go into anything that's difficult and again fighting is one of the most difficult things and then there's bad states of mind and those states of mind can determine the outcome and just to have something that you can get to in your mind it can put you on the right path like what you're saying warrior or hakalau like are these anchors that you're doing like these different things like I feel like these are applicable for everyday life too exactly that this is something that people could really benefit from like to just to instead of just being like random and wild with your thoughts and your ideas going into something and hoping that you have a good point of view and a good perspective instead of that like have these clear paths that you've already thought through yeah I mean your mind has to you mind has to have a clear set yeah that's no way to go we think of it like a TomTom our sat-nav you point that in that direction and that's the roads it's gonna take you to if you put in the wrong that say you've typed someone in Illinois and you're driving around Los Angeles lucky for you not to find it so we have to be specific and what I do is I try and get my programs that I do various programs that I do is I have to get what the client wants and then once I get the client once I put that in but then I find out what's getting in their way through the language the kind of language it wrong you know they say I want this and said yeah but you're saying that and and it's a it's I love the job it's such a blessing to me and I'm not being all you know roasting it glasses and I absolutely love my job I love people like the people with the feedback I've out of getting message you're saying I feel different I'm happier there's no bad job in the world not at all well I mean you know better than anybody that is a fighter the way you think and that your mindset that that affects your training it affects your outcome it affects how you feel in between trainings it's like and then absolutely affects the way you fight yeah cause it does I mean I reckon like I've mentioned earlier ik and I have lost fights on points because my mind sets being wrong going into it thinking right he's gonna be an absolute Wallis and I've gone in there thinking right I'm ready for war I'm ready for this and I've got outpointed because I've gone in there thinking that if Ida got in there maybe a bit more relaxed sharper on point and I've been playing the game but I wanted to adjust it and it adjusted but I didn't but I fought you know I mean like you just said it happens but if you are on point me in mind that needs to be as strong as your body onions him before he can never ever be too well prepared that's why I've gone to vijnana I've used him and it has worked for me in massive massive massive fights do you meditate at all I do the whim of method again vini he loved women Finny and eat Vinny and Jordan show me about that I mean when I saw Jordan doing it one time before a fight I said know what you're doing there and he told me a whim off die off in a white war and then I started with the cold showers every morning the breathing and again I've seen massive changes in that in like my heart rate and about his absolute that works he's resting pulse rate was 31 no Jordan Jordan to a 31 man was very - yeah I went to woman's house luckily I know because I work for infusion and they they did a little bit of a documentary on him I went with Mohamed Kamel here no really well great guy and we went to his house and we went in the frozen water and all that sort of stuff and then I started following doing his stuff and I seen him on your show twice he's a sly he's brilliant there's something about him his his perspective is and his enthusiasm is not it's not just infectious it's like it changes you yeah like he changes the way you think of me have you done cryotherapy at all I have yeah friend in Liverpool doc he's got one of whenever of Nigel real obviously my body gets for a lot wear-and-tear home holding pads takes a lot how here usually when you've got to train twice as well on top of that your fucking forearms right yeah yeah my back in I always have inspiring my legs be oh yeah exactly I get stiff and after an odd week of training around week you're teaching I do need that so I go over to Liverpool then I jump in now and I always come out feeling like a million books all the time no I love it I love it what about isolation tanks have you done sensory deprivation tanks I've never done that I got one here I'm gonna try it hell yeah how much time do you got think as long as you want fucking love it man it's a mission all sorts now since we've come to California we've got just feel supreme our mates from my Murphy's got him on CBD oil just doing our aeronautical things and I left it in my car um I have this lotion CBD lotion you will apply it topically or you got like bruises or told me of animation not tried that great man but I got a tester yeah yeah I got a test on Byam my sponsors like took all the hair follicles out of me tested them all and sort of could test what I should be in what's foods good for me hair fall hair follicle test yeah like the proper send it off to the lab they tested it all indicate a test and not blood or I'm not sure I've no idea how it works but they came back and said write these what you should eat what you shouldn't he if this is in your diet try to take because this is causing like some disruption here and stuff it really in what kind of stuff are they saying causes this might be horseshit certain different fruits and stuff like that rubber isn't raspberries and nuts and stop recording some sort of description in my diet huh they'll be better if I took them out and almonds I went to one of those places they told me stop eating avocados like it the fuck those are great for you it's like the best foods you can eat I'm like what avocado fucking out here but I just want to say cuz we've been here for a couple of weeks now right the coolest thing I've seen is how the fuck did you hit that time I just blew my mind I could not believe oh the archery time is amazing well do it every day 45 yards and to hit that little small hole like that is not not difficult but I just broke the record of kicking that pad so I was excited we were a little concerned we had a splice sound from the other one because yeah we had more than one recording of it luckily but that thing that Francis and gah know punched that almost as hard as I kicked that that's how fucking hard that go here it is right here yes Francis punched that fucking thing that is hard where's 152 [Applause] someone to break it some of them you know I don't think that many people are kicking that thing but yeah that archery thing man it's the same thing as like like today when you were showing me different things like like you guys showing me just a little bit of an adjustment change the power of that kick just that little extra it's all bottom economy every every strike every sweep everything I teach is always body mechanics and just like that little bit will gut is the same thing with archery with archery it's all about posture and form and you gotta have your elbow up high and everything has to be perfect and you're pulling with your back I mean there's a lot of parallels between archery and fighting yeah but you just you just went yeah hey watch the arrow and it just went this far you don't need to fight but I do again I do that every day you know i arrows every day and that's at 45 yards of my house I do 90 yards yeah yeah so it's done that's about as far as I shoot an animal that was 45 yards like maybe I'd shoots a pig or something nobody gives a shit about like you lucky you don't have them in England man we got problems with them here big problems oh they're fucking they're invasive species they're crazy and they breed three four times a year they'll have like 1012 pigs of litter plenty of the pigs tomorrow Lisa by the way sweetie you got a there's there's videos of pigs in Texas Texas is so bad that they opened up a highway and the day they opened it they built this highway and the day they opened it there was something like 40 car accidents with pigs the people driving by the pigs run across the road and then just slamming him into up there millions of pigs in Texas millions well they're an invasive species they were brought over here in California by William Randolph Hearst you know that crazy guy that Orson Welles made that movie rosebud about yeah yeah he's also the reason why marijuana's illegal over here too right he made those propaganda articles blaming marijuana for causing Mexicans and blacks to rape white women it was this crazy propaganda but it was also that he didn't have to switch his factories over to hemp because they had come out with a new machine called the d√©cor Decatur that allowed them to process hemp fiber hemp just makes a way better paper and he had all these paper mills and all these forests that were dedicated to trees they would make paper out of and so when they came out with his d√©cor Decatur you know I felt like well hemp as the new industry is like yet the fuck it is and so he this crazy asshole like literally is the reason why marijuana is so illegal and demonized not just in America but around the world and he let a bunch of fuckin wild pigs loose on his his his gigantic estate these fucking things are everywhere bro this ain't shit I mean these these look more like them it's like a nice little bit leads dessert these are domestic pigs bro Jamie these are not there's no wild pigs yeah shut down a freeway in Texas oh no that's a like a truck fell over yeah they were inside it yeah but those are like regular pigs like in boots on wild pigs would never be around a person like that they would fucking be out of there yeah in Bhutan they is at the Bataan about a country called Bhutan and I've heard that the the feed pigs cannabis the cannabis sure pro tastes good make them delicious bacon Canelo you go so you guys don't believe Canelo with the clenbuterol I don't know I just look GGG door Lord to us you gotta appreciate Canelo as well right yeah he's a great fighter but I just can't see I can't see past the gee-gees you win this time yeah well I think Jesus you won the first time yeah I do definitely I think you were three rounds first fight really first pay-per-view fight mmm at first you know big big big fight you could tell early dogs couldn't even see myself fairly tall he took himself free or fall to get going but when when he did and then found that steady pressure and got behind his job you yeah he's brilliant and we seen that little clip that he said he's gonna change something's gonna go to the body more yeah I think you should I think you should have done that in the first fight when he was up on the roads Canelo really good at evasion he's right and Ronny if he had gotten the money then I think I think there's gonna be a lot of that and I think there's gonna be a lot more jabs he just is so underrated like little David Lemieux yeah yeah smashed him a PCS job yeah see what Abel Sanchez said that when you when he turns to the right what happened was the referee was because he was turning to his it was his left to get away from the right hand he was exposing his back and if Yugi did hit in there he was worried about getting a point taken off so the referee would have called them on that yeah that's ridiculous yeah you should be on punch especially if the referee was as bad as the judge well there was one sweet lady very nice lady big fucker glasses like that like missing man's shoes responsible for some wacky ass fucking decisions you a lot and no one does anything about what worthy of a man boxing when she did it in Holyfield yeah yeah cousin she a part of the whole Pacquiao Tim the fox's name yeah wasn't she part of that I don't know I know I think she was part of the I think she's the one that give Canelo the draw against Mayweather when he goes yeah yeah I think she should be fired that was close very nice lady again very nicely Stevie Wonder world of that's just crazy that she gave Canela dragons Mayweather I mean he got fucking schooled in that fight masterful yeah big-time couldn't figure London London but not much that wasn't interesting well in his defense Mayweather drained him down to like what yeah down one fuck yes they caused that you know that no they said well we'll fight you at 152 Allen and ellaby weren't okay cuz he said we was gonna do it 154 and they says we don't care what Gill down to 152 and they went Thanks what a study mistake and he just left herself wide open themselves yeah he was seriously sluggish in there yeah well he makes anyone look sluggish don't it to be fair yeah he does man he's amazing like what Floyd is able to do like his control of distance and his his understanding of what you're gonna do next is so incredible yeah like you see him pop a jab and then before the guy even throws the right hand he's like done yeah it's like bitch I knew what you were gonna do it did not work Marchetti did that right a pop to midget Janee we've gone round back of him before I even realized some great things with a Robert Robert Robert Guerrero yes we've got a box for in England called Josh Kelly have you seen him yes yeah yeah you guys have a lot of great boxes over there now me obviously you have the world champion Anthony Josh yeah you hear the UFC is gonna offer him five hundred million dollars even if that's real weight I wonder if it's real Joshua versing in Gondo ism and Punjabis someone's going to sleep Jesus Christ I yeah I mean Francis is a great MMA fighter but he's been fighting for five years yeah he just hits fucking unbelievably I can't believe that you said he got hundred and twenty thousand she's like 120 something I think that's so crazy wow that's so crazy that's what I get with a kick you legs they carry her around all day guys up I'm only hundred behind him yeah well you know in his defense he's a hundred pounds heavier than me with just what in the fuck his hands are so big every time I shake his hands I'm like how is that a person I mean it's like it's like shaking hands with a brick like a giant brick they're just so big I've got a little baby on his belly probably crush my fucking huge dude man I mean and we were talking before about how his in his background he worked as a child in a sand mine digging selling all their just all day digging sand like what a what a great workout that is for your body tell stories ridiculous all that say we're almost fucking with five years ago five years ago my sign for UFC title yeah and came real close that's a great story if anybody else other than steep a steep a so fuckin tough and skilled and kept away from him but you saw what he did to Overeem k1 grand prix champion dream champion Strikeforce Heavyweight Champion Francis put him into orbit is that meta-chem off his shoulders - ridiculous and you could see the way over he was fighting him Tuesday yeah any moment is this it 129,000 161 I got 150 what was it 152 - that was today though the other day I got I was super fucking happy with Tyrone Spong what's the former previous record 114 you know he's got one 29,000 161 with a punch I got 152 today bitch but that's with his arms man I mean that is it's it's possible to really over emphasize how fucking crazy that kind of power is with you bigger than my legs or to be fair oh yeah no bigger than my like say my legs well a guy like that I believe Francis is 33 I mean imagine if it caught him when he was 25 yeah you know I mean imagine that guy it's like that's what you were saying before it's when you get a real champion what you're getting is the top genetics the top talent skill mindset and disappear and they've got that and the one I want in it that's the damn thing there's a lot a lot of Fighters they love and hard fighting get out I've seen this again in a gym they'll get out the loved one but the fight will have been hard and I remember saying we'll come back with a hard fucking fight it's gonna be nice to be out these men do you know what he's signing up for yeah you know what you doing yeah yeah you and then I've never seen him again yeah okay as well I mean certain amount of real sort of you was what to be world champion pretty much straight away didn't he who's died yeah of course he was 90 when you want you first of all so 19 in it's crazy Italy and first time I thought Sanjaya were 21 what's going on with Giorgio Petrosyan he's fighting on won championships always fighting tiny nice and open it got a stand up yeah sign like Fabio pink why they sign yeah last month when he won a couple weeks off fucking punch man for his high stop that guy starchy's people I don't know I remember when that Jordan for him in in Thailand are in the corner for Jordan and Jordan came back at the end around 2 and think he's gonna shield I went duh yeah I mean why I went on my t4 in it it's not Tony steel close fight with him yes he was here the first time I can yeah no I remember George yeah I mean it's a did the level of talent these days is just so fucking amazing and one is one Fc really huge in Asia I can't they've got yeah are they like UFC level yeah yeah yeah Michael shit Michaels you fellows doing that good girl Dhoni is now a fitting the slide live free different so got the MMA and then they've got the hybrid or is Muay Thai in little gloves in the cage like John Wayne parsley yeah and then they've got just stand-up Muay Thai with a ounce cloves and already k1 the thing I think it's Cathy with the eight ounce glove so they're gonna freeze separate things now there's certain guys that you just see a silhouette of them even if you didn't see their face you would know who it was yeah you know my favorite that is Sancho like if you saw a silhouette of him just moving around you'd be like oh yeah that's all in free times I'm used to him booting me all over the place what is that like fighting that guy if you know what it wants so much he's power or and he's accurate if he wants to hit you straight on the chin elitist around the chin she wants to kick you clean across the ribs he'll kick he clean across the ribs the first time I fought him I'm only 21 a real close fight I just showed him a little bit too much respect so again like I was saying about the UH noir fight earlier saying get me much get me much I can do about the Mac and do better and I honestly believed going in that fire I was gonna win and in the second fight we absolutely smashed each other to smithereens I cut him really bad I rocked him with punches hear me as well with a punch and wobbled my legs we absolutely buttered each other I remember in round four I won the fourth round and he went gray in the corner I went in sat down I went I'm fuckin out with a win here I'm gonna win by the time round five and up and again I'll call our backing skin I blinked and it kicked me about sixteen times another fuck did he do that end of round two my coach and my coach went because he's sunshine yeah it's his eyes and stuff that second fight even though a lost day he's one of my favorites because to be able to push the greatest of all time well or at least of the last 25 years into that deep water and y'all really proud of that anyone born our best moments in sport and even said afterward said one of my one of my toughest fights but we're good we're good friends now stuff and I probably go over to Thailand and train with him at some point what amazes me about him is his movement he's very unusual in the way he moves around a light on his feet in and out and switches stands constantly and is very creative with his approaches like he does all sorts of weird shit like there's one fight it's on his Sancho Thailand Instagram he he's got a guy up against the ropes and he steps hard to the right and throws a left high-context a that off it's like straight up in the air yeah I mean it's like this if you watch waiters first I think he sets it up by kicking the leg and and bringing me of one over yeah but he's he's a master wat stuff Lyla I remember the first time I saw him he jumped in the air and I looked up and I got kicked in the leg and I'm from the fuck with other we're not concerned oh look at him in the air but I mean like got kicked and I think you know how did he do that and then when I watched it back I realized and yeah some of the stuff he does when no one else can do that he's so creative artistry and that's what you get is a mr. lammott Uncle Mike right that's also the way he even he hits pads are different like the way you hit he's he's just tapping but he's not hitting it now a little asked but you don't want to get hit by any of it but he's like constantly moving when he wants to hit hard as well they can't like I said a few times evenly clean on chin and I remember thinking fucking hell I won't expecting that is like working the pads like when you see the way he throws kicks like he's not he's not like he could probably do that shit all day yeah just so loose um flexible but he's a fucking tremendous fighter man and he steals buffet seven faint now and he's still is he 38 my 37 faith yeah it's amazing yeah and he's still wiping the floor with most of the incredible people he five I mean in just constant movement and attack his his pressure and his the volume of strikes that he throws means he's a fucking unbelievable fighter man yeah definitely a probably the best about doubt over the last 20 years I mean he even did one fight in the stadiums in Thailand two-on-one and in this one that you won won won and this was this were only about five six years ago Pat Boone Chu Saget now so a San Choi ranked number one pet poon to number two so I got now probably number three and these weren't like lesser fighters a name he formed two on one Sagat now going don't you got him for the first two round four and he went at him and just try to wear him down and clinch him for the last three rounds Sagat now jumped in fresh yes and I want Wow southpaw pepper and she's a clincher yeah question you've just tried to wear him down that is fucking insane oh there we go so he fought one guy for two rounds and then a second graphic a me refresh yeah unbelievable man that is unbelie-- the size difference as well the smile is bigger than him he's like well he's always fighting bigger guys but you got to do a giveaway in the stadiums with all the betting works out there no one's gonna bet if sunshine comes in at 135 and boom shoe comes in at 135 no one's gonna bet because they're not essentialize gonna win right but if San Choi comes in at 130 I'm pet boot shoe comes in at 1 3 4 then it's even in the up a little bit then the gamblers will all get on it and he's gonna that's what's also interesting about Thailand's that the gambling is such a giant part of the sport influences it's so big and it influences the scoring in the decisions and stuff and what about like guy's fixing fights you worry about a lot you where about fighters throwing fights but then they'll get thrown out steady and there will be about five but can they do err about that a lot you all swear about people like dropping stuff in people's drinks to try and just like give them a little advantage when their gamble is yeah to me got poisoned when he fought rose you Petrosyan said to me well but it's true I don't know so no quote me on it but he told me that when he fought on a thump or promote he said that he gave they gave him a drink and he said he was dizzy yeah and that because they'll not fight I think they had about a million by outside but so it's about 20 grand side bet there Jimin is gym so you do it do it about stuff happening like wow that sucks that's a wild ass fucking place Thailand right yeah I'm sure great yeah I love it I love going to the food static you know especially close to me where I go yeah I loved - beautiful Costa Mesa followed but you know what you know Bangkok beautiful yeah that's right too much time in Bangkok I lived there for like 18 months to two years or so now yes whenever I go now I prefer to go to the island so I can train and then relax coz when I would I was living in the gym all time and I couldn't act oh fuck I could do that anymore now later now could go silk sheets baby yeah I can train hard and then I can yeah the other thing is I rocked in a room in the gym with nothing but a fan blowing hot air on me no aircon all ties that I like fast asleep snoring I'm sweating my head off and having two hours sleep and I and I couldn't do that anymore now right now I'd like I go to the island I can still train just as hard there's some great coaches that sober I can go it's a beach you can relax it's like okay is that where you go poke out some more yes mmm yeah yeah is uh that is Phuket a safe place to go to yeah you know you know Thailand safe yeah everywhere you go they used to like seeing drunken not that I ever drink over that drunken stumbling down the road for Ang's with like lady boys wait no more horror story is that our stories about a time I'm in the media stuff like this horror stories everywhere you go yeah yeah all the time I spent there I've never seen no one taught up and really no never that's amazing I even obviously it does up and what happens everywhere John Lee parts are the same things every was lovely yeah yes yeah I've been to his gym and spent time with him he's another one that if you saw his silhouette you'd absolutely knows yeah cause he's so he's got such an odd style movement yeah you know like there's a video of him go to John Wayne parts Instagram well he's change his style a lot now cuz obviously when he lived in Thailand he had to fight the thigh way mm-hmm but like since he's back in Australia now and he can adapt to the lab he's such a good puncher as well he's right both ways I'm sure if we have a 14-time which you don't need to anymore he's done all that but if we did I'm sure he'd notice I get this like really he moves it's a hundred percent John Wayne par you know I'm saying yeah I mean it's very fascinating like you if you watched him you would know for sure if you didn't see if you just saw the silhouette oh yes John Wayne Park yeah definitely for years well I'm he's got so many fighting again into weekend training like a fuckin Savage so knocking people out and one of the nicest guys you every one of me yeah this couldn't be nice yeah he's wife's nice and yeah and he's key son Jesse doing flips and shit yeah his daughter yeah me and her fought on the same show in August last year and as she came over she be a British girl yes she's she thought this might rain in my garage and just watching him kick the bag I was like holy fuck that guy kicked yeah it it comes down a lot away as well WP yeah yeah I think I've seen him before any my 84 kilos and then like to freewheel a boom 72.5 shredded big fan of Australia I'm a big fan of Australia they're just nice people never been it's fucking great everything can kill you though don't leave us shocked spider egg Squatch in Australia will kill ya and crocodiles it's a crazy fucking place but you know that's they're pretty close to Thailand right yeah six hour flyers yeah he's like that Spain isn't it I mean when I go abroad they you know and they go get drunk oh go and package holders go to Spain silence the bear Spain really is that what you guys do you go to Spain what are you gonna Spain yeah New York I love me okay me my wife goat milk Kamioka Majorca my oka ago before with all my friends we're a beaver our biza but it's Z hazardous varnish not sire bond yeah a weird one I've heard people say that I'm like this is a bezel what did you say I'm too old to go so B for now just but no you know younger that's a Spain thing right like the youth there's a lot of fun yes right yeah yeah no yeah true probably is yeah good fighters from Spain as well fuck yeah well Europe is always had like ridiculous Muay Thai Talent yeah the French thing outside Milan I think he's probably France then England who's that kind of went to jean-marc what is his name that boss yes yeah he were great fighter came into the MMA off the Tempe hit me with young kid you fucked him although it was up all night drinking had a bar like went to a club was drinking came in smelled like shit had a fucking like a glass with him of alcohol like and then put on the pads and I got put on the gloves and beat the shit outta ya we're dropping them all at everything around Ricky got ranked number one at Roger diamond Stadium when he were fighting to like top top level it means promoting now putting on like real good shows yeah really good show yes I crazy thing about him as he doesn't look like anything no never looked in great shape or anything but you like that when he fought no muscles little fox people didn't look like that but you could catch the legs and sweep your eyes put your sleeve yeah right and yeah John Wayne puppy Denise talked about well what will great about Scoob Oscar's I used to fight from 140 up to 165 in one no no way class for him when it said there's a fight at 165 you wanna do it go yeah and then he'd got fighting style you got fight two weeks 114 rock all the way down boys oh yeah that's why he was so so good now you see a lot of traditional karate style in MMA now where a lot of these guys are learning how to fight a different way and throws people off with like front leg side kicks wider stance is that hopping is it wouldn't a boy fight yeah but you don't see that in my time well talk about tension tension the kid from Japan the new kid yes brilliant a southpaw I love how do you say his last name not to come not soak our yeah and that's fucking amazing to actually these him and Sakura and the and they won't let him fight they're the same way Tucker is just won the k1 and thank you 60 kilo something he's gone yeah we showed a video of taco rue sparring the other day knocking oh yeah right yeah it's horrible but you know tension it came from originally from karate doing karate as a kid and the thing is he's been knocking out ties as well because unpredictable and you don't know what so fast as well if you can get that balance and in Muay Thai scoring that's gonna be a bit difficult for care one yeah yeah it's beautiful but it sees so many different kids he's Moroccan kids coming from infusion at the minute that I just you know I'm like wow he's amazing isn't that it's just the tensions only 18 right maybe 19 now yeah we have attack we have a fighter called Hurley from from Holland and he sparked you know like kid you seen 18 you know nobody else a Nabil Haru Lee and just knocking blokes parking them is just like there's some dangerous boys about I am so glad the old fella it's uh it is amazing how combat sports just like kind of any other sport they just the new talent just learns from the old ways and they get better and better I mean it's just there there's better talent today to the Vox evolved in an evolving all the time in MMA in particular because it's such a recent sport I mean MMA has really only been around like popular since the nineteen ninety-three somewhere on there so if you look at like nineteen ninety-three MMA versus 2018 so it's like fucking the light years difference but Muay Thai it's more incremental right and it's not it's better but not as much better know that the Westerners are that they're coming on for so much quicker out there now yeah and I just think it's the opportunities that are getting thrown on you now with like the likes of Yoko the likes of you know other promotions they're bringing him free I know we've just got some really good like Daniel McGowan and his last performance he fought he's gonna go live in patch Indy now he's sponsored by them he was absolutely super but we've got some I'm very proud of our country when it comes to my time I'm very very and proud of it because I've been in the days where even before Liam I've been at 34 years been involved in it and just seeing sighs come over and beat the shit out of people like like we like hooray no fucking the game drop beloved the likes of this man here and the likes of other people given us a better chance you know so he fights a more competitive and sighs are starting to train the train fully and like they trained for him like I know that my life at trains solidly fully and when he fought him on that yeah he never did never trained trains one week for a fight Donnie Airport he was telling me before I've trained two months for this if train two bumps would you fight him on what lion fight it was lying for me he won't be my point something yeah oh I saw that fight yeah that was fun yes fight yeah keep sweeping him yeah yeah that was good fine one judge give me fucking 5046 to him really yeah was a delay bird so lion fight hasn't had a fight in a long time I haven't heard anything that they wants to be with access TV but then I don't think they are anymore that working with our MC GP it's run by Karen kettle loose with the one that M ck yeah they have an American outlet or I actually don't know fuck they need something in America so what big one thing is they were you know like access TV is Mark Cuban's Network and it's they've got a lot of great fights on it it's they they've always had like a real good strong Muay Thai and combat ck yeah yeah and well they have Pat Miletich is doing commentary for MMA this weekend with that but it's just they're missing you know the wide distribution of like a fox or fs1 or things that have gotten the UFC so popular yeah they've got them they've got to stand out fighters as well really definitely need more stand-up fight is to get their fight is like on big show the brought they've got Kevin Ross mm-hmm obviously the shielding as well but he's more MMA and k1 and Onegin topic and they're like the two that says about you know Muay Thai in America rot topic they're the two that come straight chillin is there are fighting belt or mallet are champions about yeah it was great it's great I'm a big fan of Bellator kickboxing but again it's kickboxing and stumbled I prefer to watch Kevin fight Muay Thai because he likes to go a walk so he's exciting to watch him do that yeah okay won't let you say it limits what a Muay Thai fighter is yeah yeah got an English girl called Iman Barlow who's infusion champion as well and she's a lion fight Muay Thai champion she's that she's 110 World titles he's had 140 fights and she Viton since she was four what actually yeah yeah oh yeah she's from the assassins you mean Lester trained by the clip over offing koala yeah I'm seeing it well she kicked so she kicked ten tiger nine times in a row right left right right right what is her name Iman Iman pretty killer Barlow spell that Iman is a I am a and like I'm on Marlo yeah I'm on Bob yeah she's real battery if you seized when she sees me but yeah she's a great fighter you know where's your accent you guys is this Liverpool I live in Liverpool but I'm originally from Manchester so what is the difference in your accent and the live I talk very posh comfortable did you say Scout was talking like that he saw a wagon yeah like is this the one that's serious thank you I think it's marinas waiver there bowhead kick to the body and then to the head damn oh fuck yeah that's the thing about legs man I mean every woman that weighs 130 pounds is carrying 130 pounds around all day with her legs yeah try walking around your hands all day yeah women can knock you the fuck out she won 15 yeah yeah she's only small she sound the winch yeah it's really nice it's like oh no don't go for a girl 1200 and plus physis it's ridiculous really when you think about her Bush she's still smashing and she yeah she's won about 95 96 percent yeah she asks you ever well how old do you know Liam Fay - so you're still in your prime right now I think so yeah I mean my last 10 fights I've probably won eight the two losses have been on points one to Fabio Pinker top level operator and number one in front of a French boy were above on points but army fights in between now even knocked him out I'll stop to him and I've I feel when I'm training and when I'm fighting I feel like I'm in prime I feel like I'm stronger than ever I feel like I'm faster than ever a sharp whenever I've still got the hunger and I'm still really wanting to fight all the time we saw all I'm concentrating on as well as I'm training overs as well but my sole intention is still I've still got goals that's the thing like I know about a lot of ice and stuff I've still got goals I want to achieve and I want to do and then look what are they well I won the WBC title in 2015 and you can see I've got a metal plate in me I'm now brought my hand and they didn't even give me a chance to do stripped me on the belt straightaway didn't give me chance to say right where few moms defend we can defend it then just stripped me of it and now other people have won in stuff so I want to win that belt back and have little molasses surgery in your hand they just stripped you yet it took it off me here why did you that I don't know I think they wanted the French boy who I went to defend against or fight for it because it was in front so they let him fight for it in many he won it and stuff but now I think the titles vacant how well something I think the champions moved away it's become vacant again I probably should be saying this but I am fighting for it later on in the year against a real real strong fighter as well I'm and I don't think it's been released on ok but he's gonna be in probably biggest fights prints in in in a long time so obviously I've got that looking forward in July massive Mastiff I I'm defending my UK number-one spot I've been looking forward to this for ages I've been number one in UK for about 13 years and now has a lot of talk about a guy shall appear is number two in rankings climbed his way up had some big wins and he's shot he's got the old country divided it's not free South I'm from Leeds which is up north he's from London which is down south he's got the country divided he's earned a shot so I'm really looking forward to that that's a bit of a grudge match yeah you could say shit talking going on a little bit bit a little bit I'm fucking useless it shit talk that I like thrown in Seoul out there it don't even make no sense Connors got a gift yeah you know Conor McGregor yes Hills good as well Louie Leo I mentioned earlier he's good he's I'm not fucking useless I'll keep my mouth shut so where's the best way that most people can watch you fight like a lot of these fights you're gonna have to watch them after the fact in America right yeah most of do come straight on youtube so Manukau put some on they put them on their YouTube channels it is just yo cow yeah yok ka oh yeah yeah yeah I mean mainly that's that's the one liam fights on there's a lot I come and say on them a lot which are very privileged to the you quote yeah even these other outlets if you type in Liam in in YouTube whatever they can watch you I love the way you commentate cuz you always say something you say isn't he he's winning isn't he wasn't it yeah that's an English thing man you like you like you say something but then you also want everybody to agree with you I think thank you Scott I'm quarter Welsh and the last do that so maybe that's a DNA thing I say ah you were good in mourning why no what is that when I was in England just having conversations with people that sounds like a speech pattern that people do over there yeah I first heard you when you were doing It's Showtime when you doing commentary I remember hearing that like this guy always does that it says that some of the some of the things I mean there's one fight where Muhammad come out and Massa BAM Ronnie and I got fucking bananas and looking back at it now I'm thinking but they loved it the Dutch said yes we like you were screaming like bitch yeah squeaky voice it makes the fight exciting great thank you Bill so I spend that much time in Holland anyway but yeah thanks for that the real pioneers right when it comes to like expanding into muy Thai and kickboxing well how did that happen like the Dutch it was a key occasion bass originally right yeah I mean you gotta thank people like Johan Voss Tom herring and a young + Voss trained Ivan Hippolyta nesto host shakur iike dad badder from the beginning Peter Aerts etc and they the pioneers and then but now they've got so many good Jim's coming through and so many kids that yeah it's like they fight like you've stole something from them know that they just blitzkrieg each other in their like the Thai version of the tides in Thailand Moroccan touches their land k1 they're that version so out to be that week I know Liam Liam loves Muay Thai and you know trying to talk to Lee about kickbox and he just gets annoyed but you don't watch kickboxing I will if Vinny says watch his fights amazing now watch I won't go out I'm away to watch it I don't know I just like to stalk isn't that interesting he likes what he likes and that's it you know well that's all there's a big thing with a lot of Americans you know when it comes to like I've tried to show American fight fans Muay Thai even like good buddies of mine like yeah the fucking you not like this yeah it's what people like it I used to like watch boxing but now been watching her that movement specialists you know been doing all that movement and stuff I've I've started doing him especially you know I train with a guy called damn it and now and he's a student of Ito Fattah and I like watching that I myself just sat there watching Manning men swinging around and rings you know that Scarlets called menopause like I've worked with done not long back and some of the stuff he does he's amazing especially from Muay Thai obviously your hip flexor and stuff are working all the time someone like the different stuff that you're doing always I get really tight around me and stuff when I'm kickin all the time and that's some of the stuff that he showed me a moron believer but felt so much looser we love that guy yeah have you ever done any yoga no I did hot yoga once and I nearly died I'll do that one again I should do to be fair but I think now that I've found done and all the different stuff he showed me I think now that can replace any any soggy ogre I should be doing could this stuff is is amazing well yeah I think it would be a good complement to your style because your style fuck yeah you're so like tense and powerful that I would think that like maybe that would like open you up a little bit loose that stuff that dondo see it does he like he's open and using different joints and stuff pointing positions I'm not used to and three fairies it's odd but after you've done it and you after you've done the work outs of it joinha you just feel lucid yeah you feel amazing this is brilliant look I go every Wednesday morning and I don't want to go I'll fucking tell you the truth I'm driving down that's an hour away from me I'm thinking fuck this and then I get there and it's just a it's just a very very special how illegal is weed in England I mean I'm not in swimming listen bro take two solid hits and then go do it so I hate somebody hiding room backing myself or I'm telling it it's not for me American we get a hold some of this California show you an orbit serious paranoia's who hits and then go to a yoga class it's like you're on a journey you're like you get out of there our out of half it's perfect because an hour and a half into the sweating the pots worn off and you like can come back down and put in the middle of it you feel like the world's gonna end any second now in the middle of the class like there's no way this could be sustainable there's no way I'm not gonna survive did the whole way you just think about everything that's going to happen Tracey again would you like a house and not me I can't do it don't agree with me I love it for yoga Simone my favorite things ever take two hits and go to yoga I think you spent your stone you can't not be on stone quick he's just like oh shit wait fits wear off no there's no wearing off quick yeah caffeine helps a little bit hey remember Jordan give me a drop of cannabis oil before and I like melody no he saw her for about six hours and a company we're not thinking I'm dead he hired someone I had some cannabis oil and was sat there watching TV and then I was like fuck you know I was mine remote control from the TV and this guy was going to Laura and it turned him over and I went to me fucking self and then I knew for that's not for you this well it's just one of those things like anything else you gotta ease into it understand I like it for just relaxation reflection you know yeah I think it's also great for like pain management and just you know after you're done training everything sore your shoulders your elbows yeah well my mom and dad they both love it well I've just never been able to remember I tried to drive before I nearly had the fucking paranoia attack hour he had to go hide got a jiggly ass but those other guys I'm all on of India I mean I'm sure every aspect if you approach pop approach muy Thai that could be a real fuck yeah a child in pops room was all in pots from the adenosine Rogers just bang just just okay just bang it so you're trying to like get him to settle down yeah I mean I'm I'm no nowhere near the level of his coach I just all parts in the way that I can I'm more of a boxing holding pads for boxing because there's no way he's hit I've old pads for Jordan Watson and I'm not holding pads I'm not very experienced not again an old man and I'm not old impossible Jonica twice as hard as me as well he's kicks her absolutely rude probably break straight through me yes I'm in here nightmare Odom putt for him I'm sure I've seen him fine I saw him fight Giorgio - it was a fatal mistake that yeah you know Giorgio Petrosyan got such good eyesight that he's just humble about him I knew about years before than 50 years ago yeah this kid this kid this kid my boxer for him and we went in and we heard about this kid ha Giorgio Petrosyan like right whatever yes he's on beat and blah blah blah fat fuck off he's just trying to scare you don't worry my boxer went out he was a great fighter himself Rick barn a lovely kid got his own gym and uh for bamm-bamm slip got caught drops body shot then he caught up again body shot leg kick bank and he come back and he said I cut it on this little nasty fucking cotton I'll tell you what the most kids bashing pressive thing about him as well he was to watch the videos of innings to send me a finger looks alright comment aid with anyone's live on him and I just saw the soul stuff they does look closer on the little slips the little step off from southpaw and I just said to Vinny and I took the microwaving this is fucking unreal just the sort of stuff which is Mexia a level above anyone else the grass cable fighter of all time yeah and I mean it puts you what it does is negates you it negates your rhythm so yeah when the Dutch fight the Dutch mainly in combination the fire fight fast hands fast kicks they find him straight on but he negates that first shot and then you step off that's what we said again he puts that right palm yeah yeah he fight southpaw it's a right palm out and yeah he throws a lot of teep kicks off the right front leg is strong as well if he's deceptively strong is Armenian is not actually Italian this is real names give or he's really call him Giorgio Petrosyan but his real name's Gavroche they changed it because it's more palatable for the Italians but he's uh yeah it's a very very special individual so technical yeah there's a really interesting guy to watch them train - yeah I love I love watching him iPods not nothing's done over art or anything it's all just imperfect yeah every shot be perfect yeah I mean again like everybody's got their own style so that's one of the beautiful things about Muay Thai is that like the art is very straightforward you have your eight weapons but it's like how you apply those is all based on creativity your own personal preferences yeah that's the great thing about like we need watch the top ties in Thailand you lover a technician but then you'll have a big clincher and there might be getting the floor white with them outside the clinic but as soon as they grab old and they start backing in big nizina stuff it's gonna make the fight one more interesting it's then the technicians job to keep him off the team to move to Scotland cakes that's what the great thing about Mozart's that's why I love it so much but that's why I think it's the best striking style is because it incorporates so much grappling there's so much sweeps and and clinch and knee work and controlling the back and the neck and you know this it's just it's so effective it's to take that out like when I watch a boxing match and like break like why breaking yeah go back and watch old Jack Johnson watch old Jack Johnson fights issue that was a heavyweight from England knee Easter Easter clinch well it was since been working with Liam and doing the seminars that we've been doing I've been doing it a long time and I'm watching him and I'm gonna know and it's been brilliant for me to fall in love with my tie again because you see what he doesn't know I don't know well there's so much to boxing right mean when you see a guy like a Floyd Mayweather or a real technician like lomachenko just is so much to learn now leg kicks knees head kicks elbows clinch all this other stuff mean Muay Thai is almost never ending yeah I say all the time I've been training Lee 20 years and I learn every day every day i will learn just somewhat new whether it's some up from someone in the gym of inspiring whether it's from my calculated memories from a youtube video watching a fight in thailand some I'm still learning every single day and I remember my trainer from Thailand Jeb when I would live in there he was saying I'm 50 years old I've been doing this for years he said I learn every day as well that's never a yeah it's never-ending that's why I'm in love of it so much Jesus is very much an MMA being exactly the same with the rest in the jujitsu yeah it's one of those things on the outside you don't see it but the closer you get to it the more you realize like wow this thing is like never-ending yeah and you know what I'll be honest I've not met anyone that I'd really dislike in it they're all pretty decent hunting nice people did not fuck up each other than the like just talk about a character developer yeah I mean what develops your character more than combat sport yeah I mean you find out who the fuck you are yeah exactly and that's why we'll come back and work to what where I was saying earlier you find out who you are some people think fuck this lighting me other people said fuck yeah let's do that again that you matter me yeah and that's that all the best fighters are all the most best people you're gonna be as well I think like look at how much of a gentleman Petrosian is yeah I mean absolutely you know what's funny about the fight with Jordan patrolling they're very similar characters are very very nice people I mean Jordan is an absolute you won't think Jordan was a fire you know when I'm at him super sweet heart lovely guy alright but you know you know and then you then at the end of the fight which I was your Petrosyan so she runs on what he's had on him yes he hugs him yeah because I think like a truck like and I think he understood that it was a fight once it's over the bells ring you know I said to him because I message Georgie I'm sure she said you you know punched another one of my friends whatever congratulations don't hit another one of my friends I love me to deal with as if he's fucking scared like it matters and he said oh no he kick hard he kicked really hard it kicked very very hard so he was still respectful you know you know as a good guy listen let's wrap this up Liam thank you so much for being here thank you very much my honor and thank you for training with me - that was not a
