oh shit here we go Ian Edwards back from Montreal back from another country what up man did you see my consumer yeah man was in Montreal at the comedy festival first of all Canada is right there yeah but it's such a hard country to get into it's very hard to get into it's crazy yeah they don't want any douchebags they have a zero douchebag policy but but listen I saw the ex-mayor of Montreal right in walking down sunset in front of the Comedy Store the one that was on crack right is that the Toronto guy the Toronto Board you saw that guy yeah so I got one day walking by The Comedy Store and everybody took pictures with him and he was the mayor and he did crack there's a tape of it right right so how the fuck did he get here but Canada won't even take a drunk driver from us that's true well I think crack you're probably better driver when you're on crack just more expeditious to get things done yeah that's uh like if you commit a crime you can't get into Canada if you have a DUI like Patrice had a DUI on not yet well not patrice but I know people have duis that can get into Canada oh yeah it's super common like were common you can't work there you can't get in there des can't get up there say again yeah you can't get up there right but you got like some real shit right that's one real shit armed kidnapping that's why I say DUI because even though DUI is a serious the ones where you you get convicted but you do your probation period and you you know you you get your license back you know you you even when you get your license back you can't get into Canada but somebody who was the mayor and sold crack and I know other Canadians that probably committed crimes can be in here yeah well why the fuck is it so tough for me to get in the counter when I got to the airport they uh I've been to Canada before so when I got to the airport they had me to try to fill out some migration form and it's three hours I was like two and a half hours early thank God then they want me to fill out this form on my phone online it's like 40 something questions online online it's the new way to do it it's a new way to do it well again I got a British passport so uh everybody that was just had a straight American passport went in how does that work you have like a Jamaica passport is that what it is no I got a British one because I was from England from England yeah and so now when you're in America from England like how does it work they give you like have a green card so you're not a full American citizen no I'm like a perfect about certain shit with you why not because then it's like treasonous be careful odd I mean that's really odd like here here's a perfect example perfect example I didn't know that you were born England they're fried if you told me I forgot right you probably forgot I probably and people forget we forgot yes about each other well especially that kind of fact is it doesn't mean anything right it doesn't mean anything but like automatically like in the grand scheme of things I'm supposed to look at you like oh you're on the other team one of those people I just read about these Russians man these Russians in New Jersey did you hear about this I'm not Russian anymore dude I'm not trust in English people either anymore the Russians were in I wanna say Montclair like a nice area of Jersey and they were a regular family this the Russian film but they weren't really this regular family they were actually embedded Soviet spies well that sounds like the America look at that shit Russian spies New Jersey home heading for sale damn don't buy that house fuck watch my fuck my fine money and shit in it there's gonna be cameras that watch the shit come out of your asshole there's public cameras everywhere watch this shit you can't get a Russian house from some Russian spies you gotta be like a crazy person I don't might find some hidden spaces with money and shit yeah maybe feel like a total voyeur what does he said he said that he doesn't expect the Russian spy connection to help or hurt the sale bitch you're out of your fucking mind I mean that's not the worst thing that can happen to a house it's just a bunch of you know spies nobodies hopefully nobody's murdered in the house but when someone's murdered in the house good luck selling that house they can get the part you get price down you're better off just burn it to the ground smashing that thing and then rebuilding a new house and even then people don't want to live there because that's where the old house where the dude got killed used to be the master how old is your house it's a brand new that you know person in there no no no a thing was made in the 70s 70s yeah do you know if anybody was murdered there or died there uh-uh I've never seen a ghost I think they have to inform you but there's a moratorium what's that website you can look it up I just heard about it I'm not sure doesn't ask you if you heard if you knew about it a website what'd you find out somebody died in your house yeah it's a good yeah like do you remember that that this one always got to me man that uh those brothers that shot there there premiered the Menendez brothers so one of them had a wig on remembering it likes glorious fake head of hair they may have take it off when he went to jail it was a really crazy story cuz they shotgun their own parents right whoa man how the fuck does that happen the you know the one on the left to one of the has a total way I mean I get it now the one on the right was just blessed if just straight-up blessed with some curly locks what the fuck man those those those sons shotgun their fucking parents man you know Kirk Fox used to teach them tennis oh that's right that's right I do somehow vaguely remember that so he has a whole story about teaching them Taron tennis dude that scares the shit out of me that people could do that it doesn't scare the shit out of me nearly as much that people can get so angry at someone they could shoot them but it scares the shit out of me that someone could do that to their dad was their mom - why didn't they shoot the mom - they are adopted right were they yeah I think the Menendez brothers were adopted oh really yeah and I think I think they're just trying to get money Oh what is that sexual and psychological abuse they'd suffered at the hands of their parents oh well there you go I know it's like you always want to immediately blame it on the kids right they killed their parents but the parents could have been fuckin monsters yeah you never know oh well it's God they have to be monsters I mean if you think about it how do you make a kid that is capable of shooting you in your sleep you got to be you got to raise that kid horribly unless you just by dumb luck have to complete genetic psychopathy from birth that you could have done nothing to fix you've got two guys that are willing to shoot you while you're sleeping and you raise them for them time work they were babies that's crazy yeah anyway I was gonna say their house yeah I wonder what happened to their house burnt that fucking thing to the ground probably I wonder what happened to it like Nicole Simpson's house Oh somebody lived there wasn't Nicole Simpson's was that a house or was at an outside an apartment building that's a weird one because that's like it's a public building you got to just deal with it people just deal with it is that apartment like still empty her is that he killed them on the street all right he killed them outside but every time you go home you have to step over a crime scene to walk into your house and you've seen the pictures yeah you know the history every time Oh Jay documentary comes out or every time they have an old Jay series on TV or when his parole hearing comes up you're like walking over the doorway into that house so I wonder like I want to talk to the person who's like doesn't give a fuck Springwood yeah listen she should have been nicer normally did you ever see the autopsy photos did I don't know if you haven't don't it's not worth it you get it I saw the murder seeing photos it's just so hard to believe that someone could do that to someone yeah it's pretty thick haired about it they had babies with right just people but just rarely that's what it is it's like every week it's the game of Thrones normal on the game of Thrones which I just started watching in you did yeah I didn't know what the fuck was going on man I started watching this new season I was like I forgot everything I've started watching it like a few months ago I started watching it over from the beginning oh that's what you should do watch it yeah from season 1 you see how much stuff you didn't know or didn't understand right I didn't realize and because Game of Thrones they don't give a fuck like they'll introduce a new character and have him talking to a regular character like they've been talking for a while yeah and you're like did I miss something exactly but then if you go back you know another guy is new I'm not supposed to know him yeah it's like homework you have to research to understand that show well this these kind of shows have kind of stopped my interest in movies yeah like movies are okay mm-hmm but a movies 90 minutes that's it or two hours it's over when it's over I don't you know I'm done right but these goddamn things get you infested yeah like I'm not like what is this a nerd HBO hacked upcoming episodes Game of Thrones data leaked online so the results like the scripts that they mean by data and I like the show oh no actual oh nothing hack recently some other shows got taken too they should just edit offline oh my goodness monsters you monsters how dare you yeah some whiz kid right probably from China something like that yeah we can't compete anymore Russia's kicking everybody out of Russia hear about that shit they are all the people there working at the Embassy 75 American delegates or whatever they would be called I'm sure they're happy to go home yeah once they say Russia out of here unless they got something going on yeah got some crazy fake Russian life over there just like the people in Montclair 755 diplomats what does that mean we're gonna war with Russia no come on man they've got mung in montclair right they got a house people just live in there what happened to those people in their house did they kick him out put him in jail I think they put him in jail go back to that story like how they find out they were spies that's a good question man that's a real good question just went to the house sale like well give me some give me some explanation here y'all it says their story partially inspired the FX drama the Americans about two undercover Russian spies live in the u.s. with two young children that's a fucking amazing show is it really the Americans is so fucking amazing really yeah man what's it on Vladimir in Libya how do you say that name gory girl you have yes lad Amira in Libya good yeah lived in the home in Montclair under the names of Richard and Cynthia Murphy hi were rich in Cynthia Murphy hi I wonder what they talked like before they arrested in 2010 along with eight other spies accused of leading double lives complete with false passports secret code words fake names invisible ink and encrypted radio Inc dude what kind of weird-ass life is that it's weird to think that there's someone that could be a spy in your neighborhood and that he thinks that you're the enemy because you were born over here and he was born over there you know just like what we were talking about with you having a passport from England no but what's in Jersey that they live in in Jersey hmm and doing this shit right who are they close to well Jersey is close to New York first of all and there's a lot of very wealthy people that live in Montclair I mean I believe Montclair is a very nice area Google that should be my uncle used to have a pottery studio a pottery studio in Montclair that isn't that is some rich white shit it's more like hippie artists stuff he's an art teacher used to teach art in in in school I don't think it was not I think high school what's up Montclair new Jerzy what's that word they use median medium income yeah look up that I think it's a baller place I think it's like Beverly Hills it's like the Beverly Hills of New Jersey maybe I'm exaggerating that's a lot of money yeah for the average that probably means someone's people raishin yeah there's probably a lot of rich that's just one poor rich person that brought that price down why do you think they do it okay let's let's take a guess do you think they sneak in they become spies they get tight with rich people and then you know like look I know a family that had Ted fucking Cruz over their house for some event they were holding I was like like a year or so before the election maybe two years before the election like these people were so baller they had Ted Cruz give like one of those stupid stump speeches in their house so ammonia is ready to raise money to raise money they're like big Pro is real supporters then Ted Cruz in their house talking about Israel very trippy shit like very trippy shit like you're you're literally hanging out in your house with a guy that might be running the nukes right yeah like so if you're a Russian spy and you can get tight with that dude you can hang with that dude Frank yes Ted Cruz really coming over you what it makes a lot of sense a lot of his policies that are real Amelia green and you just call up the Russian embassy send me some money so I can donate to pay and get closer Ted Cruz and just bring in a truckload of Vietnamese hookers just get Ted all fucked up on that same method Rob Ford had solos right just get the party wrong start filming we need to know it started start having black male info on Ted Cruz we need to know we can count on you everybody keeps getting fired from the White House does anybody understand what the fuck is going on over there it was anybody fired today yes there's a meme that scarab Moochie guy whoever you say his name there's a meme of him where he's gone like that like with his mouth I'm like uh-uh and it said if you if you get this job where do you see yourself in ten days it's like like how do how do you hire a guy who clearly looks like he's done coke mmm does he he looks like a wolf of Wall Street he looks like a wolf of Wall Street yeah I played him like this is this is the guy yeah this on looks alone like this cocky he's a he's a hedge fund jock you know he follows everybody online he probably followed you hilarious follows me he does yep yeah that makes sense I think he follows everybody which I was like a hundred fifty thousand would you ever have him on the show of course yeah that's a great guess I would love to talk to one of those dudes find out what it's like in there especially guys in there for like ten days this guy will talk well I have had a hedge fund guy I know that Peter Schiff guy on before that financial wizard he's coming on again he's in an interesting cat he's a big-time Wall Street guy I mean he's got some gigantic firm that employs who knows how many fucking people mm-hmm but he's he's also always on television breaking down what's wrong with like financial bubbles right at the real-estate bubble he called all that shit the subprime mortgage bubble he called all that shit years ago I'm calling the Netflix bubble right now ooh I'm calling it cannot sustain itself you're not the only one but that's alright cool you know there was an article that was out and just yesterday about debt there was something about Netflix being in debt mmm like 20 does think of us said it was Google times did an investigation and it was just like they found out there 20 billion dollars in debt how's it possible because they spending so much money on these shows man and promoting them and it's like listen they just celebrated a few months ago they're hundred million customer like whatever they called it 100 million yeah look at that Facebook will be laughing because face price how many subscribers right but there's a big difference Facebook doesn't get $9 a month from you right but each one of those hundred million people are giving $9 a month that's 900 million dollars a month good that's math most a billion dollars a month that's 12 billion dollars a year maybe 10 10 billion dollars a year you know what an insane money you know what it is what is what it is human man man is so valuable right I know even when something can work like they make systems at work right but the problem with those systems is that humans run those systems right and they are so valuable that they fuck shit up is that the right way to say that we're valuable probably not it sounds perfect but yes people fallible I always thought is fallible I'm a British accent makes things sounds different but there's always those words that you never say mm-hmm but you see written and you know the word be like how am I saying this like I know what this is but I can't I don't say it I can't come up with a good example that is one but you know what it's funny I don't remember ever saying that word Oh Roy sometimes we writers must one like I never say Reuters like the Reuters news source but when I look at it I'd okay I know what that is I've read it up thousand times but how do I say that routers Reuters Reuters boy that sounds right it is the right way to say it that's what everybody says it okay but when left to my own devices I pronounce this yeah I have way too much totally useless information going around inside my head I got to do some spring cleaning I gotta throw away some tamari I throw away some childhood memories that are not serving me we're just taking up space in my head I just you run out of hard drive space man yeah you do every day you're looking at some news story every day there's a new thing going on you know and especially if you're trying to follow Game of Thrones and maybe house of cards - and maybe stranger things mm-hmm I remember when I so remember everything like I could remember every movie every part of every movie every part of my childhood and then now somebody said ma'am at a time we did this and I'm like you were there like I remember the time but I don't remember that you were there but I guess you were yeah I now states my memories full I need to go to the MAC store and have some shit added yeah but if you were like an all Farmar mm-hmm you remember all that shit it was just every day getting our milking the cows picking the eggs and killing a sheep or something for dinner right you would you would only you would have those memories right because you're in that same spot every day thinking about your childhood your way from all the distractions yeah and you know coming yeah and no books no books no I'll just read one book like over yeah this written in storybook form well it's what it was yeah the Bible is you know a fascinating book in that it's you start off with someone telling stories for like a thousand years mm-hmm before you write it down and then you got a bunch of really old versions of the story no one's sure which ones to use right like they got the version that's in the Dead Sea Scrolls that's the oldest versions of some of those stories and it's it's one of the only like I think maybe the only one that's written in Aramaic no they found it in these clay pots in Qumran and Qumran is an area in Israel so they have these like little caves and they would find these clay pots and in these clay pots they got these scrolls that are made out of animal skins a lot of them so they take these Scrolls out it's so crazy it takes like I think it took them like 14 to 15 years just to piece it together damn dude they're all broken up and shit and they couldn't figure out what goes with what so they had to take DNA tests on the actual pieces of animal skin so they could tell okay well this is some skin from this animal so let's concentrate on this all these pieces have been genetically tested to be from this animal so let's put these together probably the same scroll then they have to like figure out I take these crumbs and chunks that are just thousands of years old I'm supposed to trust this well not only that it's also you're reading it in in an ancient ancient language you're reading it in the also like the references and the way people thought back then yeah then they have like the oldest version of the the Hebrew Bible is like the the very oldest versions were written in ancient Hebrew and ancient Hebrew is crazy because it has numbers as well as letters so like like if you have the letter A it's also the number one it's all the same it's all linked in so like when you have a word like words have like a numerical value and if I'm butchering this if anyone's an ancient Hebrew represented but Ari and I discussed this for a couple times because Ari you know went to what is it called like that thing that they send him off to that religious camp when he was like a serious serious Orthodox Jew oh so that's why he's such a serious atheist now oh you're such a freak now that's exactly why but so like their words had numerical values like the word God and the word love they have the same numerical value all right so you know like with you know the letter A the letter O and they all have like numbers like we can't even think like that because none of our words have numerical value right but like the the actual meaning of a word has more value with more numbers to it it's really interesting all that stuff's lost on our stupid goofy language is when they train translated to Latin and it translated to Greek or to English it's all kind of lost and then who was translating this shit and what was everything is based off like what your goal is or what your perception of the world is in where you're from and how you were raised and what you want this thing to mean to people right so like like you can't get away from that you know so if you're the person putting this stuff together and translating it's like how do you not let your influence influence this thing you do right we get a little you take it yeah you want it to mean the things that it means to you even if you just want people to believe this is an ancient scroll that you found yeah you know and this goes back to you finding it and it goes to your name and to your legacy yeah like well there's also massive amounts evidence of people looking at something and then having a distorted perception of what that some thing means and having that bend in their favor right exactly there's a dislike so many points of evidence I do that would all my relationship I mean how many people think that they're the victim how many people are just running around thing in the world's against the total victim in violation service yeah so that's just evidence of bias thinking if you have bias thinking in regards to the way that the God of gods wants to govern humanity right and our behavior and how we should behave with each other and treat each other if you like gonna let your own personal ego and biases getting the way which it absolutely did there's two shit writ in the Bible that treats women as second-class citizens they condone slavery there's no there's no like talking about slavery as if it's some horrible thing that has to be like banished tonight this candid like there's in the ancient Hebrew Bible they condone slavery they just there's really nothing bad about being about having slaves it's like God doesn't come and kill you but God will kill you if you wear two different types of cloth I know like like they'll burn which is like you know what you're which why cuz I said you're a witch but you know what's not evil slaves yeah the intractable the Inquisition the during the Inquisition they weren't torturing people because they had slaves right because they thought that we're witches they were torturing people because they just didn't believe enough we believed in a way yeah yeah you know if you wanted to get rid of somebody that say somebody had a job that you wanted a position that you wanted if you could prove that that person like slandered God or blaspheme or anything yeah then you're out that's the standard maneuver right yeah oh yeah you get a government to get rid of this person for you that's how you get shit like North Korea and that's how you get shit like Isis you know you you just everybody turning on everybody everybody trying to figure out a way that they can use their power but that's what's kind of happening in America to a little bit yeah yeah there's an article and the neat thing was in New Yorker just like too ago the senator was a senator wrote it is where the article last night is a Republican senator and he said when Obama was president the Republicans made a concerted effort to just push the Republican agenda and make Obama a one-term president and now that trump has hijacked their party they're kind of turning a blind eye to things that they wouldn't have if Obama was president just because Trump is the Republican candidate huh and he's like where are our loyalties to our party or to this country because we're kind of like fucking up the country you know and it's kind it's kind of like like when Obama was president you know no matter what you think of him like if if he if he was a good president right say he's a good president because he's not your person you're gonna shut down the things that he's doing to get your party in power like you don't give a fuck right because all you care about is your party winning like like and now that Trump is president the Democrats are taken the same thing from the same book and I'm not even saying Trump is a good president but I'm just saying everybody's turning on everybody yeah they're all trying to figure out a way to win so they get their agenda forward and that's not the country's agenda no at all so we're destroying but destroying each other well it's there's definitely like a battle between the two sides right now you know I mean there's a lot of people that are getting excited by it they take they have not just a vested interest in it but it becomes like a part of their identity to be a part of the resistance all right fighting fighting against this evil empire but at the detriment of like saying it maybe not I mean it really depends cuz like when you put a tremendous amount of pressure on someone like they're putting on Trump whether you agree with it or not it forces that person to realize that there's people like that out there and you adjust accordingly it moves the tide a couple of degrees one way or the other it just does like did the idea that we're not called truly malleable that our cultures and shift back and forth it certainly does things that used to be acceptable our now completely taboo and that's just over the course of like the last decade or so so I think that even the far left it's all necessary it just doesn't seem necessary because we're caught up in it and we can see if we just meet in the middle somewhere can all be them but if you just looked at this thing objectively like not not like a human being even right look at it like a mathematic problem right like if you could see human culture you would say oh well there's this complete constant shift of energy that goes left and right and left and right like some crazy ping-pong game occasionally goes right and right again very rarely like Reagan and then Bush senior but then it bounces itself out and goes left again it's this weird battle and along the way if you look at like if you really step away from it along the way there are incremental changes that are moving in a good direction it's just hard to see them yeah I get that and then we only hear about the stuff the bad stuff because I'm like each side is just trying to get points from the other side but up but others I'm just saying this is that when one party no matter what parties is trying to do something good even if it's something good then the people from the other party are gonna be against it because they don't want that party to score that good point then they knock that off the table and that thing that could help people is never gonna help people the thing is also a part of having two teams if think if there was way more teams if there's like 20 or 30 different parties we'd be way better on think you're better off yeah politicians are spread across 20 or 30 different parties instead of jammed into one or the other or the the freaks that are independent or a green party like you're the fuck out of here with your green party it's goofy right that's no one's gonna elect a green party president all the bankers are gonna put a stop to that this guy's just kind of steal money from us fuck this he's gonna give it to penguins and shit you know I mean that's gonna give up money to Penn yeah so you got really three choices you got independent which is so rare the only person I could think ever winning as an independent right now honestly would be someone like rump or like Elon Musk he's basically Mark Cuban Trump is basically an independent who hijacked ya the publican party well he's he voted Democrat like his whole life he was pro-choice like his whole life you know it's like he's he's been on the side of Democratic issues forever right I mean I saw the video where he said I saw the video right the day before I saw it twice the last time I saw it was the day before the election where he said if I was gonna run I would run as a Republican because Republicans are stupid and I saw that video like him being interviewed I'll tell you the next day that shit was scrubbed from the internet and then if I tell people I saw that video they said now you're crazy it was just like so he really had it taken down yeah man dude that's like some l ron hubbard type shit l ron hubbard was quoted as saying if you really want to make money should start a religion and he started scientology wasn't bullshit coming yeah he's a fascinating character man i mean obviously there's a tremendous amount use with him not telling the truth that might be the biggest problem the number one biggest problem might be the line that we can't trust them that is so crazy that you're president that just lies all the time but if you step away from the lying part and you look like what he's doing what's interesting is this is i don't know too much about the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare but I do know that a whole lot of people who voted against it are now voting against repealing it all right so it either means one or two things that means Trump's plan is so bad that the people who hated Obamacare like this is even worse right or it's a bunch of people that just don't like Trump and even though they didn't want Obamacare in the first place no no matter what Trump comes up what they're gonna be like fuck you alright we're gonna fight against that which maybe there's a few other it could be this or could be that but those two to me are pretty fascinating that's like childish shit yeah the whole shit is child it's like I just feel like everybody's just going after everybody when you spend your time going after people to remove them from their position yeah what are you doing for the people when you're going after like your own selfish gain you're spending your entire time in office trying to get one step up well he's got a lot of stuff that's not just him but everybody else under him plus him trying now he's trying to stay up he has to spend his day fighting shit right right instead of solving shit yeah he's well he fights people on Twitter and he fights people on Twitter he's the president of the world right president United States kind of the president of the world like you you might not be running these other countries but everybody knows is the country that has all the fucking bombs and it's crazy enough to use him right so this is the president of the are arguably the greatest army the world's ever known that's the commander-in-chief right there it talks shit about people on Twitter it's actually about people having plastic surgery scars hilarious like bleeding badly from a facelift I see so you're he's so crazy so so crazy it's so crazy and people are so angry and I get it I get it I get everybody being angry I get it it's not what I'm saying I'm just saying it is the whole thing is so surreal it's like everybody wanted change and then when change came you're like no no this change is making money right no no we don't want that it's guys stealing money like he's gonna make billions of dollars like what the fuck is he doing where's his tax returns show me the tax returns but I think what's gonna come out of it is that there's so many people now that are politically motivated there's so many people that are looking at this whole thing going whoa whoa whoa whoa you can't just sit back and just let this happen then you get someone who doesn't tell the truth as the president you know and that you know how bad that fucks up kids right when you're looking at like the highest level of human being in the country like every kid says Billy what do you want to be when you grow up I want to be the president yeah that's the issue yeah like damn you want to be the president you don't want to be the vice president you want to be the command you want to be the number-one guy that's an ambush right so possible yeah but it's also like if the guy who's the guy at the top of the list isn't better than people that you know like his mari is petty petty he goofs on people they just don't like his policy right he'll talk shit about like their plastic surgery right a guy with fake hair is talking about people believing those are in surgery oh but it's just like the whole hurt your feelings thing the lash out and hurt your feelings things like that he's trying to do trying to hurt their feelings like someone just needs to like sit him down and just I think they tried here he ain't listening he's doing this his way I know he is cuz he won but he won that way so he's like that's how I won my base likes that gotta let go when doing it in you gotta let that go cuz you have a you have a broader responsibility as the the head guy I think he's getting feedback that enough that he has the amazing ability to ignore to ignore things that I wouldn't ignore and I think most people would ignore like like low back like like I remember so this is what happened one one time I went to see a movie screening with Kevin Hart was in it with Usher it's a long time ago and being careful friends we used to hang out so we went to the screening and we sat there and we watched a movie and the movie was terrible so then after the movie I'm gonna see cab so my worries like what the fuck am I gonna tell this guy cuz I can't lie to about this movie and before I said anything he looked at me and said man a movie was bad but I was great and you know what he was right he was so he brushed off like how bad the move how bad and found something this motherfucker got trauma can find something like he could heal here what he needs to hear from whatever he's done there probably enough people if it's even one or a few million that likes his tweets like we only see the people that hate his tweets right oh there's a lot of people who like us we don't have American flags in their avatars yes so he's gonna go for that like eagles and Dobermans and American flags and guns what is uh the reason he gave some recent speech right I thought was really on the chopping no no no that was good one too but I think it was today where he was talking about unemployment being down how the economy is up and all these different factors and they were talking about how no one mentions it and then I went to CNN and I was like yeah they're not even mentioning that he's given the speech and he's saying oh like how much how much should that be the number-one story like what's the number in one store when you go to CNN go to the front page of CNN what do we got here what does it say high stock market ever best economic numbers in years unemployment lowest in seventeen years wages rising border secure yeah but when is that true well no that's true III don't know it's probably true right but these were the same things that will happen in when Obama was president and he used to shit on it he used to say it's not rising enough the unemployed the unemployment level should still be lower or like when they put out the job gains or whatever they call that shit technically he would say that's not enough growth so there's a way to shit on everything but look at all this like look at what they show on CNN like right away you see on the top Trump weighed in on Suns misleading claim breaking news so you got a negative Trump ad no inaccuracy in Donald Trump's jr. statements about 2016 meeting with Russians White House says White House comments on Donald Trump jr. statements timeline of duck so none of that has anything to do with unemployment being down of the economy being up and this is like the front page of CNN it's all negative yeah they're going to have to run for sure but this is not good it's not good to do that like you're not giving all the news you got to give the news like he does plenty of stupid shit that you can cover right you're not a short of stupid shit but when good shit happens like when the economy is up when unemployment is down you probably should be reporting that it seems like that's news but I so if it's true so if it's true right okay you're you're you know you have a powerful Twitter your name is Trump right and you know listen you know the game by now all right so you know if you tweet about some woman's plastic surgery mm-hmm they're gonna go in on you yeah and that's what's gonna be on scene at CNN but that's not CNN oh he was MSNBC right but it's gonna be on every news all the media outlets that are not in favor of you are gonna put that right so everyone except Fox everyone except Fox so it's like stop putting shit that people can use to cover up and use instead of the employment unemployment stuff being down you know what I mean we're like stop giving people ammo against you right you know let me stop giving them information negative stuff that they can put on the front of their website instead of unemployment numbers going down yeah but there's no way they're gonna stop that is he if as long as they're stories like that like Donald Jr secretly meeting with the Russians and not telling people and then releasing the emails and then saying that you know all that stuff and then he turns out that Trump doesn't want to coordinated a statement about it and I said all that's really it's never gonna stop he's fucking up yeah he's fucking on but here's the thing you got to write the good stuff too yeah yeah you have to have right news there I mean I feel like if I'm gonna trust you for the news I want I would like to think as a person who leans very left I would like to think that CNN is going to be better than right-wing Koenig and a weapon nuts well how can they not be that's that's very disappointing is very didn't have both things I don't trust none of them I don't trust the the left news or the right cuz you know why because when Obama was president or just empresas before like a lot of shit was phony and false right you know what I mean right like they just did it here's a funny thing so they just did a study of like body cams on cops right instead a study and they said from the study they see that cops treat black people that they pull over worse than they treat white people and say well fuck what we've been trying to tell you that but now it's only official when white people did the study they're like you know what this thing is true but slope I've been trying to tell you that shit is true for a long time but that's just a part of it's like you're not covering anything that doesn't serve you you know what I mean you know you're not covering anything that doesn't serve you anyway yeah but their news they're not cops I can understand like cops being racist that I get that but if you're if you're the news source like you have to just distribute the news you can't selectively decide canon can't hear ya you wanna focus on you have to and you should they never have well they should they never they should but they just never have well you know just obvious now what's really fucked up that it wasn't really getting nearly as much press as I think it should get or people have really been talking about that much is how many people were concentrating on that white lady from Australia who got shot unnecessarily by the cop right because she was a white lady from Australia all right that look no matter what you say what that is is an I mean obviously it's a tragic accident she was the one to call the cops and then they shot her but you know many times they've done that to other people but that's my whole point it's like like the news serves it members talk about the scrolls and how you can't if you found a skull the scrolls you can't help but make a story right that is in your favor right like I forgot the exact words you use but it's just because like your perception is gonna come through in this thing to me that's how the news has been all my life like whoever owns the news makes news in their faith it's always has been since William Randolph Hearst used to have Hearst publications yeah so that's that to me the news has always been even if it was like slightly inaccurate before it's just being growingly not accurate yeah but that drives people fucking crazy you mean that it does because he should because like when I was a kid like a stupid little kid and I was watching a new just stupid enough to think like when somebody's telling me what's going on in the world I'm like the news is God like cuz I thought it was all real like just like not just like a kid that's like you don't know any better right but how do these people know everything they're telling you everything so you're kind of getting programmed to believe this shit so people are getting programmed to believe Fox MSNBC CNN and they don't know any better and they're getting angry based on what they're being told and we're not being told everything we're not being told everything like you're saying they're not showing both sides right or everything they're not there's no reason for the people who own the news to be fair that's true they just have to get people to pay attention there's one good people get so their that their thing is how do I make money right that'll be outrageous we got to be outrageous we got a we got a even now we got to follow this Russia story and we got to make money this is a sole proper this is Game of Thrones going on on fucking TV this is like when Katrina they milked the shit out of Katrina and any tragedy and they're just milking this that's like every like why is everything coming out like alright so there was a meeting so then it was email so then like like it's almost as if somebody wrote a script and today we're going to give you this part of it today we're gonna give you this part of it like it's like it's unfolding like a TV show keeping people's interest in a lot of ways it is like that house of cards show yeah it's like house of cards yeah yeah I mean almost even less believable like everybody was like in the house of cards spoiler alert I can't even say I don't want to say what happens but there's there's some moments on the show where people go well that would never happen that's not it who would get elect like look at the what the fuck is happening the president's daughter is always behind him with a giant smile on his front her face every time he says anything and she's clapping today it's like he's got his kids in there right kids running shit and supposed to be running his company he's supposed to be away from his company but that's not you won't even show his tax returns the whole thing is so gangster it's so Putin esque it's really fascinating and now with this thing that's going on with Russia I mean who knows I might be just nonsense they might just be posturing with each other meanwhile they're doing deals behind the scenes like I'll tell you what I'm gonna do bro dude bro I'm gonna kick the delicates out I'm gonna get pissed and meanwhile they're making some crazy deal to like tap into the oil in the art Antarctica so I'm sure like they're kicking the delegates out maybe maybe maybe to look like maths to look like hey I'm not on if I was a friend of Trump I wouldn't kick your delegates out exact maybe right why would I keep the diplomats out yeah if I'm working with them yeah come on man Yeah right yeah they'd just going back and forth yeah it's all so strange it's just so strange that people can still rock it like that like you still could be a dictator in 2017 there that is one of the last remaining like archaic jobs like the one dude running everything guy with a giant army everybody keep it together keep it together good have a safe life all right keep it together don't fucking push me just give me a little money all right let's it hurt you to give me a little money you can't give me 30% of your money yeah come on man give me 50% come on it's not that big a deal I mean that's that's what a lot of countries are stuck in right now you know and in in Russia the crazy thing is if it doesn't go well for you they just take your company they have these multi billionaire oligarchs they just locked these dudes up lock him up take the company it's confiscated just throw in a jail cell keep him there for four Thrones until that amount dude I was watching this one documentary about this Russian guy who was and he was at first he loves working with Trump and somehow another he disagreed with Trump rather Boonton dude that's like okay that's a Freud shit he was working with I'm trying to remember the full story but he had some sort of a business arrangement with Putin and then he tried to change it or he didn't want to accept new terms or whatever they just locked his ass up he opposed something that Putin wanted to do okay yeah sorry dude he complained he protested sorry dude they put some charges on him yeah they put some charges on him threw him in jail and who knows man they might look if you get to be some crazy multi billionaire dude in Russia they probably don't even let you in there unless you've done some fucked-up shit with them they probably listen dude like you know you got good to drink vodka f40 with us come on I mean even on the lowest level you have to get jumped into a gang and you gotta commit a crime to be a part of the gang so if they got to see you do some dirt to see you get it if a gang will do that why when a bunch of billionaires who have way more to protect yeah make you do some dirt with them do some dirt and also show that you're crazy enough right to be down with them yeah like yeah I like you but I need to know if you're loyal you know what Ari told me they made his dad do in the Israeli army what you've raised a kitten you raise it you take care of it by yourself you pet it and then when it gets to be like a year old you gotta kill it in front of them with your bare hands sure grab it snap its neck just to show that you can do that I was like whoa part of the game is that I was like whoa just to show that you could shut it off like you've got that ability to just shut it off like you have this cat you love it you're and you're gonna kill that thing with your hands well if you could do that they make you do it I know I mean Y if Y you you have to get Cole signed to get into billionaire club yeah you got to kill people you think what do they do with like guys like Jeff Bezos that Amazon guy you ever see the photos of him Solaris the photo of him like when he first started out like 12 years Ian's dorky and then you look at him now he looks like a fucking assassin he's got sunglasses on he's walking aggressive TRT TRT lizards but he's got like a girl on each side of him or something like that I mean how much is he worth now he's look at him it looks like a killer oh sure he literally looks like a guy man I just hired that was like a former Navy SEAL that's coming over to give you advice on how to secure your corporation you know I he would show up at Apple and hire a bunch of hitman that's him now is that what that is he's pretty fit guy yeah but he seems like a fit guy like he works out see well there was an but there was a before and after oh man goofy goofy town okay yeah I use a little goofy but look man you figured out how to dominate online sales I use amazon.com all the time there's Kim and

sitting at home and feeling like a lazy bitch like I just want to chill today I don't feel like working and you go see the rock he's got chains wrapped around his neck chin ups the entire evening yeah hitting tires with missiles yeah it's weird he's a crazy man but those are the dudes like you need to know that like as hard as you think your work and drop one down from there that one was the other one I thought I wanted J yeah well look at that right there you need to know as hard as you think you're working you know working down hard I know is look at that guys so if you if you think you've done everything you can to be prosperous in this wife and you go to the rocks Instagram and then shut your fucking hippie mouth and they'll fuck your day up fuck it there this is what you didn't do today and I know people like well hey man I read a book today okay hey man I've been writing poetry all day a man's been writing songs ok ok but have you put the same amount of effort into being whatever you want as the rock has done in being the ultimate meathead whenever our Solaris bar has got to change do you know why you have chains makes the end of the rap harder says as you lift the chains up off the ground less of the chains being supported by the ground so it gets heavier and heavier as you lift your hands up higher that's called hardcore bro I don't know if you boys are aware hardcore hardcore can get that's so hardcore that's how hardcore listen when I want to feel bad about my day I just go to the rocks Instagram it's a good movie like shit what's going on with this guy gorilla oh wow he's got like one of those suits on that Max's own video game suits isn't that weird that they still can't completely just fake it they have to have a dude move around and clothes I mean I'm at that hololens stuff that we were talking about yesterday there's gonna be able to wear those and see pretty much what they're gonna like the final CGI rendering like they can just act with that stuff soon it's amazing what you know like I watched Game of Thrones first episode and you know that that boats not real they don't really have that giant massive crazy looking boat cutting through the ocean that's not a real boat but goddamn it looks like a real boat that's it was crazy that attack it's fucking yeah but you're looking at these boats I mean the just the CGI it's just for a television show yeah it's been millions I guess it's like worth it for spend film money on those episodes oh yeah each one is Millions yeah yeah but I guess it's worth it right cuz that thing will sell forever yeah I like it if it goes down today like it's also timeless like Game of Thrones is timeless like that me worth of shitload of money ten years from now you know like it's Sopranos as timeless - alright you know Sopranos is timeless I give the Sopranos like if you wanted to start watching The Sopranos today it would be a great show yeah it's like The Godfather of TV timeless but it's better than The Godfather yeah Italians all country screaming at me shit the Godfather's the greatest fucking movie The Godfather is an amazing movie don't get me wrong but it's limited by its format it's limited by the fact that it's a movie even though you got the Godfather one and two Sopranos was on for like what five years five years of episodes the depth that they can get into all the crazy shit that they could do it's just so different than any other movie or than any other form of yeah they could go up and talk about the gay member you out there goddamn gang yeah do anything they could do anything is a fare with its psychiatrist yeah anything anything yeah remember they killed that dude with a pool cue shot a pool cue up his ass reggae guy yeah that was the whole thing was weird you know it was like you're you're getting deep into the lives of these strange characters and the sociopaths and you kind of understand there your angst cuz you start rooting for them yeah like even in the Americans they're Russian but you start root for him you don't want anything to get caught you know you want him to and it's now I know you really are from another country maybe maybe but if you watch it watch a few episodes and see if you don't like start room for the Russians this is how this is how our picture of the show hey no don't in perfect you find out five minutes into the show that they're Russian spies FBI kicks the door down a bunch of white guys guns blazing pointed at them they immediately ship them to Guantanamo Bay and then put the house for sale ya know how are those for sale and they make a profit off the house the spy house I wonder if they did a scan to the spy house find out they scan the spy house to find out what kind of spy shit they got cuz you know Russia's not gonna just let you have a spy house by yourself and you have a party's and we've called the other day to check in we saw a barbecue you having barbecue are you working a spy which one which one friend people turn in American is it barbecue time or spy time you thought get the spine yeah so they probably they got to be spying on the spies and for sure yeah don't trust some spider just moved New Jersey have a good time start doing coke they know you could get turned oh for sure why wouldn't you get turned over here you'd like do whatever the fuck you want and most people most people not gonna kill you alright yeah you'd have to but then you're they know you're there so they'll send somebody you won't even know who the person is it'll be like some La Femme Nikita chick comes over your house selling vacuums or something you open the door she shoots you in the dick right could be I just don't understand why they would use that strategy like they hire someone to pretend to be American fly them across the world set them up go get information in Montclair yeah the watch the Americans man it works yeah well that's information yeah that's my BAE uh so I know what there's this so Syd said there's the FBI alright so the husband puts on a disguise and starts dating the the Secretary of the Director of the FBI whoa so the husband mm-hmm is your real husband they are married right they were pair together right they had two kids together and they were real well not in in the show in the show in the show they had together in America they run a travel agency and then on top of that they're both spies on top of that they both spices the travelers just hang other checks like baby she gets the bang other dudes like hams like if there's a target like it there's a station that they can get to emotionally then they just do what they got to do and then sometimes they come home and he's like did you fuck him whoa and just to say I did do before Russia yeah I do duty I mean while the both of them are falling in and out of love oh my god and then sometimes they like the people that they have to kill or like dispose off good fucking show yeah man it's so intricate damn and then one of the neighbor just moved in and he works at the FBI so then their kids go over to his house and his kids come over to their house and he doesn't know that they're Russian spies he's had hunches before whoa so it's just it's a crazy fucking show man damn good as good better or not as good as house of cards I say better than house of cards now I know you are a foreigner you're some kind of agent yourself I've told you I was a foreign yeah but now I know that American foreign as He pours his tea everything's a crime for tea who are you you don't even drink coffee you barely American bro I know I know you loved you look you have the full foreign package man you're in a soccer yeah yeah do you ever call soccer football and no no Americans around uh do you do you like that's it when they're around sometimes do you really but I just say soccer just so people know what I'm talking about right yeah that's what I was thinking you probably say football when you're around other people yeah if I'm talking somebody from sometimes I'll talk a friend from England and I'll say soccer did not get mad at you now I mean some people have pointed they'll correct it but but it won't it won't be a sticking point in the conversation it's a sticking point in America right so you just stick with saw yeah yeah you've never said football to me but I always so into that game I know who uses the proper terminology when I'm not around yeah yeah like someone will say you want to play billiards I'll let it slide okay all right and that's pool right yeah not really not really got pocket buildings in the pool right billiards is a game that you play with no there's no holes in the table never see that game I think so there's like there's like things in the table no there's well there's an Italian version of it where they play they have these little pins you're thinking a bumper pool I think but three-cushion billiards is a very strange game where and that used to be the premier game by the way back like in the willy hoppy days like way way way back in the you know I guess probably the turn of the century the turn of the 20th century they had thousands of pool halls and billiard halls in New York City but pool halls like where there's a hole in the table and the ball has to fall into the hole those were thought to be the that's the game of ruffians and like dirtbags gentlemen played billiards they played 3-cushion billiards that was actually a part of the scene in the movie the hustler with Paul Newman Jackie Gleason and Paul Newman goes over this dude's house I forget the gentleman's name but he's a very famous actor it's great great scene and they're supposed to gamble because this guy's a big fish dance this big mansion and Paul Newman is this hustler he goes over the guys mansion and the guy doesn't have a pool table he has a billiards table and the the mob guy who's backing Paul Newman on the bet doesn't believe that he could beat this guy and so they have to figure out like what to do because it's totally different game but it was the game of gentlemen 3-cushion billiards is a game where it's you have to hit a ball and then your ball has to go three cushions it means bounce into three rails and then come back and hit the other ball it's really crazy it's a it's a it's an interesting game because it's all about angles you ever played it yeah I've played it it's it's hard to do you have to really understand there's a lot of like factors that come into play mm-hmm here it is right here this is this is the actual game I've seen you do shit like that when you play pool yeah no I do I mean I definitely move the ball around and I understand some angles but like this stuff like what this guy's doing right here this this is like super complicated stuff to be able to have you win this thing you just get a point every time you get three cushions like see how he's doing this right here he's doing that it bounced off the rail it hits that and it's gonna hit the other one like doing stuff like that on purpose I mean the dude on purpose is very difficult to do like you to really understand how I mean sometimes you're going four and five and even six rails to make something do what you wanted to do because that was the only option you had with the position of the ball and the table relative to the position the ball you're trying to hit if you have to go three rails so you see like these crazy tricky shots that these guys do where they're calculating the ball going three rails hitting another ball and then going to rails and then hitting a third ball it's like crazy it's like the way they do it is amazing it's really amazing how many balls are on the table it eats three balls people three balls yeah it's really it's it's fascinating I never got into it because I would imagine that it would become addictive just like pools addictive and I don't have the time I just can't be fucking with some new thing to get addicted to yeah especially when you're gonna start you know check out some soccer I feel yeah isn't it weird though how they do this see he's gonna hit that and it's going to bounce up and hit the other one and they're playing in this out that's what's interesting and the guys who are real good at it a lot of times it translates very good into pool too it seems like it would yeah well they figure out how to move the ball better than other people like there's a guy named Aaron Reyes and he's widely considered to be probably the best pool player of all time and he plays this game really good he plays this game really good any place another game that the Filipinos like to play called rotation and rotation is a game like you know how you play nine ball and shoot one through nine you got shoot the balls an order and rotation they do that with 15 balls what yeah Filipinos are some of the best players in the world oh and it's interesting because the the the game of billiards pocket billiards I should say I guess regular billiards too got brought to them during World War two when they had American GIs would be in the Philippines apparently during the war when people would go over there they would set up pool tables and you know GIS would go to bars and they figured out how to play pool and it became a great thing for the Filipinos who love gambling love gambling so they would just play pool and gamble all the time so some of the best players in the world have come out of the Philippines like Manila has like some of the best players ever like like the top guys like that guy Efrain Reyes he's from the Philippines Francisco Bustamante where the best of all time he's from the Philippines there's like you keep going on and on and on there's a there's a whole gang of these dudes little tiny killers so I never play pool against the Filipino that's what I'm learning they're real quiet real friendly they'll smash you damn yeah some of the best players in the world it's just a huge sport over there all right it's Jay it's on television all the time over there pool is like the first video game mmm because because it's it's a pool and billiards just like a table and you go into a bar and it's there you put money in there and you start playing it before they were graphics or programs or anything it's just it's just a games like the first game you could play without before video games mmhmm yeah I mean I know what you're saying yeah it was like an arcade game like darkus yeah and dogs here they would play it I think I think they started calling it pool I know actually they started calling a pool because it was a gambling thing the thing was they would pool their money together don't bet on stuff and that's how that's how pool got its bad name versus billiards right but like darts they must bet on darts right people bet on darts yeah dart is a big sport in England huge it's on TV I saw it on TV was there I saw snooker a snooker snooker they call it is snooker is pool or dominoes snooker is a totally different game and it's on a giant table no yeah the pool a pool table is 9 by 4 and a half which means four and a half foot wide nine foot long that's a real legit pool table there's also ten by fives ten by five pool tables are just starting to make a comeback there's a company called diamond and they make a ten by five now it's a big deal because like the real high-end players like the extra space the ten by father thing it makes you play a better game but Snookers twelve feet yeah it's twelve by six it's a giant fucking table and these dudes have a cricket ball it's a tiny ass little ball it's way smaller than a pool ball and the holes are really tiny and the cut of the rails is very different like you can kind of rattle a ball into a pool table hole it'll kind of drop in but you have to hit like this is a snooker table soccer field size of this fucking table now this is Ronnie O'Sullivan who's one of the greatest of all time and he's a fucking wizard and this is the greatest game of snooker ever it's because he's just he does everything perfect and he shoots his whole rack perfect but Snickers a totally different game like see how the snooker rather that goes in there a snooker no he shot the ball in and then the ball comes back up again comes back up yeah yeah the black ball Oh every time he shoots the black there's no scratching I don't know you can scratch I just don't I don't know the game I don't understand the game but there's a bunch of points and all these different things that you you're doing but see how he knocks that black ball in and after the black ball goes in the guy pulls it out and he puts it back in the spot and then he has to shoot one of the Reds again and then after he shoots the red then he goes and shoots the black again and every time he's doing it see that stack of balls he's trying to collide into those balls to open him up and if he can open him up then he can get it to a place where he can separate those balls and make them all so watch he's gonna make this red ball and then he's gonna pound up now he's in an angle with that black ball so as he shoots that black ball in he's gonna smack into those other balls Bing see that see now again I don't know this game very well but I understand pool so I what he's doing with those balls I knew he was gonna do that and so now he's just gonna pocket these balls in the side but you're dealing with the tiniest little fucking hole and they have tiny little tips on their pool cues it's like you know it's sort of like a pool cue mhm but it's all they're all made of ash which is very different than ash yeah ash wood whereas um most American pool cues that at least the shafts are made out of maple like there's a lot of weird variables like ash is very stiff but also very light mm-hmm so their game is very different but he's also very similar he's also thinking very fast oh he's a wizard yeah this guy's a super genius but I wouldn't have taken my second shot yet I know he's like clearing the table he's doing this every day yeah I realize but you got to think he's also extremely wealthy because of this game this is not a game like American pool this is a game like more akin to like golf in terms of like purses and how much money these guys can make at least it was at one point time I think somehow or another it's dried up I think like snooker doesn't doesn't have the same respect that it used to have there's been also a few controversies in England our guys got busted talking to people about fixing games oh yeah that gets ugly that old man is like the ball boy in tennis exactly I grabbing the ball at the hole and putting it on the table but he does it with gloves on like a gentleman actually the gloves have a purpose the gloves are so your hand oils don't get on the ball because the balls are made out of what's called phenolic it's like a type of I think it's like a composite plastic and they're super hard like if you touch those balls that are out there on that table they look super hard and they used to make them with either clay more ivory back there way back in the day yeah dude a lot of times they made the cue ball with ivory and then the other balls would be made out of clay or sometimes the whole everything would be made of clay but they were like these dead balls that were really tough to move around and then when they figured out this phenolic stuff you're dealing with these things that get super slick so the the grease is from your hands if you touch a ball the oils on your hands will actually put a residue on the ball and it'll affect the way the ball move game off yeah so if you see dudes touching cue balls and balls and you're playing pool like anybody who really knows how to play is gonna go that's gonna fuck everything up put your gloves on yeah or put a towel on and wipe them down yeah there's some like serious games to wipe every ball down after every rack in regular pool yeah guys guys are gambling they want that ball to respond a very particular way right like cuz you get this when you think about what pool is right you're taking a cue the average way to accuse about 19 ounces and some very light things a little over a pound and you're taking this thing and just by how hard you're hitting you're trying to control the revolutions of a ball mm-hmm and also those revolutions after it collides with a ball and knocks it into a hole and then you're trying to control the revolutions to like literally within inches and you get a feel after you do it for a while you play for hours and hours especially after years and years of playing you get this feel where like the guy like like that guy Ephraim Rey has it I was talking about he could just put that ball wherever the fuck he wants it it goes wherever he wants it he makes the ball the ball goes goes wherever he wants it like and you watch him play it's like you're watching an art form like it's if you know how hard it is to play well that guy plays I know I suck so bad I know it's hard to play see the thing about sucking so bad though is maybe you don't even appreciate how crazy it is what he's doing I'm thinking play a little bit then you watch him you just go god like the people that really appreciate a guy like ever Andreas or Earl Strickland for that matter I mean he's like world champion players the people will really appreciate them are people that have played for a while right you know how you said you don't have the time to learn billiards yeah it's like I up the times I play pool or you play against somebody good or you watch somebody play you're like yeah that takes a lot of practice I don't have the time to get that good yeah yeah there's only so many hours in the day man yeah you want to play golf go play golf you crazy yeah no God if you want to start golf today you must you must have like just extra time coming out of your ass right that's like a nine-hour commitment yeah you got to join a country club I know a dude who just joined a country above the Kazakh order of a million dollars a year I was going that's what I'm saying what it costs a quarter of a million dollars a year it costs that and then you have to pay money when you go I'm sure they weren't there you have to get equipment unless everything's free other than that you just go there and it's all free but that doesn't make sense I'm gonna open up a Country Club I think they just that's what we're talking about like the billionaire ballers crying if you're a billionaire baller quarter million bucks ain't shit it's like if someone says hey Ian we want you to join the comedian's Union it's $25 a year you like what's 25 bucks yeah here you go 25 bucks and if you're a super baller $250,000 a year's like you're going there you're gonna run into other billionaires you're gonna do business you're gonna make that money back and you can write it related cuz everybody there's a baller all right right you're only around people could afford a $250,000 a year membership right shit all and the people that work there they just want to keep their job they probably probably pays good so they're just hey what do you what do you want hey here's your order yeah leave you alone you know what I don't get people that want to live on golf courses that don't play golf Oh for real yeah like hold on you don't play golf and you want to live on a golf course does look beautiful it sounds like beautiful until some drunk assholes are playing golf right outside your bedroom there are people that live on golf courses oh yeah oh yeah dude everywhere there's a lot of these places they're like gated communities that are on golf courses it's super common it's like the ultimate I'm a baller statement you have a gated community that's a golf course and you're a member of it there's a place out here it's called Lake Sherwood oh yeah Lake Sherwood Country Club it's amazing you go there these beautiful houses it's amazing Golf Course just everyone so wide Solaris and it's they actually have their own lake there's a lake out there you can go bass fishing in it yeah largemouth bass in this lake yeah and it's um it's a beautiful community and these people have these houses that are like on a golf course if it cost just a quarter of a mil to a part of a golf club how much does it cost I have a house probably place you live in orbit an amount on the golf course millions millions of dollars for sure I mean it's a wealthy community mm-hmm but I think that's when you get those sort of CEO dudes they start moving into that like upper echelon of Finance and cash they they want to be surrounded by people just like them and just get hot it's like us want to be around other comedians yeah cuz I don't have any civilian friends really all all comedians Yeah right now I've been in it so long like not funny we call it civilians who get mad at that by the way they are they but people get mad at at like that you like use military terms yeah sorry that's funny thing that term like I've seen you say to a comic they know what it is even if you've never used it around them before and they get it but yeah yeah they don't understand true Dibakar ii yeah like do you think you got it you need to hang out with atheists Ari Shaffir yeah in Amsterdam for a week yeah like we like run around like a friend from high school and I say something even if the person that they just introduced me to laughed they said yeah gotta excuse him he's a comedian like none of my comedian friends would ever say no shit like that right like charter like I like make an excuse for something that they feel uncomfortable about that I said you know what that comes from where human resources that comes from like office rules yeah yeah job you got to keep your behavior check you can't be yourself all right I mean how many people just live out there under a vice just a vice of just repression right can't laugh around can't joke around about shit yeah and I take that for granted because what I do I can say whatever I want sometimes I think I'm not saying enough based on the other people that are saying shit to me yeah I mean imagine if you're in an office with 50 people and you hate 10 of them and one of them is your boss right oh and there's a bunch of attention so you can dip shits in the staff taking credit for other people's work you can't say anything oh please your wife even how your husband or whatever so many people live in hell how many people live in hell like that just stuck all day with dip shits saying dumb things but that's why people listen to your podcast like it's there it's like when you watch a like somebody on TV you watch a James Bond movie and he's doing things that you can't do like just having a podcast where you say whatever the fuck you want right and just live in like people live in an office you get to live through you you know I mean through your podcast it's a lot of pressure no I just did keep doing what you regularly doing so no pressure yeah that's why you know that's why it's partly why Trump is so popular because he's the first president to just talk shit like it's truly a powerful thing like first when you put a powerful man most powerful man in the world you're censored but this is the first uncensored most powerful man in the world he's truly exuding his power your honor don't give a fuck level well here's a little bit of a fuck but not enough of a fuck to change yeah he only gives a fuck if he gets dinged a little bit but he's enough he doesn't pull back he just he swats back defensively yeah in a way that a listener would want to swap back defensively at work yeah but still can't because they had Trump seems so less worried about his job and more like I'm just gonna be me and that's an or when Chappelle quit the Chappelle show like a lot of people found freedom in that that's why he's so mythical oh for sure yeah yeah yeah like a lot of people make 50 million dollars but how many people you know turned down fifty million dollars there's fewer of those yeah you know just one just one yeah and he also didn't do stand-up in any scheduled performance for yours he just would show up places yeah and he still does like so he just uses that imma show up this place yeah and then they put out an email however he just shows myself about when I was in Denver oh yeah you just showed up yeah I go to the green room Dave's in there I go what are you doing man hey joe rogan yeah he that's his way I guess of just being free free yeah doing what everyone the only thing that he has scheduled is the Radio City thing and that's because I guess it's Radio City you have to schedule what does he do he's like does a regular show there he's gonna do he did it a few years ago now he's gonna do like maybe a week and a half or two weeks of shows there and he's gonna guest on it like musical guest comic some days like is that's amazing to have a comics ball party that's a great idea yeah that's a great idea Wow yeah I mean he does represent what we all consider to be like the highest standard of a real comic artist right you know and when you get together with a group of comedians mm-hmm and you look at like who's like doing it the right way all right I mean there's other ways to do it that I really like more commercially successful like Mary Louis is more commercially successful in terms of like constantly chasing it down but Dave is just also has that mythical quality to it as well look you're talking about turning down the 50 million there's that has a big factor in how we look at it - that's his biggest TV credit it's turning down yeah and also like walking away from the greatest sketch show the world's ever known right that is still to me in my eyes the greatest sketch show of all time you know I had a lot of fun you don't there oh as far as like hit or miss right it's the best ever right like you can't compare like Saturday Night Live has some great sketches but there's a lot of turds in there - they're mostly turns yeah just over the accumulation of years it got a lot of bullshit and that's also because of the format I mean they're trying to come up with a new show every week brutal it's you know it's also it's like when I was talking to Phil Hartman when he had just come from Saturday Night Live mm-hmm and he was on Newsradio he was talking about how competitive it is there it is back stabby yeah dislike infighting and all this and everyone's fighting to get their stuff on the air yeah I was like that I don't move and they don't care if it's the best or funny like a backstab somebody with a good sketch to get my okay sketch on so I get some some time some shine fuck it that's well listen if you look at all the people that have been on silent live right how many of them you like that guy was on sorry life there's a lot there's a lot there's a lot of center in life used to be holy shit it's Dan Aykroyd right it's Gilda Radner it's John Belushi it was people that were Josh Evie chase people that were giant because they were on Saturday Night Live if you were on sorry live you fucking made it right now it's maybe what 1 out of 10 that you even know who the fuck they are they leave yeah there's a lot of like exile hive people how about Darrell Hammond Darrell Hammond was on son are alive for a long long time fucking time but if you come up to the average person and say he's a funny comic I do you remember Darrell from New York I remember Darrell there's a funny guy man before Saturday Night Live but it didn't translate into like big movies or a lot of stuff you know and that guy was really good all right I mean he was in some really good sketches Tim Meadows what ever happened to Tim Meadows he's doing stand-up and he gets jobs but he's not big like he was when he's on SNL like I'm right I know there was a time when him and Farrah were kind of like neck-and-neck like like they both leave SNL and what happened here is in like a couple of duds yeah was that one cool movie who was in oh yeah ladies man ladies man they've killed it yeah like it SNL is like a record deal it's like when you get out you drop your first album if it doesn't hit it's a rap right show business be stone-cold look at a man ladies man and that was his character Lawrence SNL right yeah which means it's not even his movie like Lauren gets the she gets all the mop the movies hmm like you create a character on SNL it's like oh bitch that's my movie like you can't just do it on your own and then you get cut loose and then it's like well good luck I mean how many of them are there how many how many like really successful comedians have come from SM SNL versus how many have been on all right probably crazy numbers right everyone that's ever been on I think whoa oh well there's probably hundreds of people ever tan he's doing stand-up now yeah I forgot how Franken was on it oh shit yeah he's a he's a senator now yeah and he want people wanted to run for president Joe Piscopo that's right he was the jersey guy I'm from Jersey are you from Jersey I know where's Rachel Dratch she was down to quit hitting it Garrett Morris yeah yeah there's a lot of a man you forget Janeane Garofalo was on SNL oh shit I didn't know that I totally forgot that that's right Gilbert Godfried Dennis Miller okay booked on fish Molly Shannon whatever happened to Molly she was huge on there she was huge off of there remember she had a bunch of movies yeah what happened to her I think one of the movies bombed she had like two and they bombed it salt eggs and if they're done with death I didn't know Sara silver roles on SNL yeah she was for a little bit I don't know anything I really very barely barely pay attention but yeah that's uh I mean if you look at like all-time sketch shows I mean SNL had to do a live one every week got to do all-new material every week doing from studio audience do it live on television a lot of impediments but as far as overall quality best one ever Chappelle show Japan you know what number two might be in living color yeah people forgot about in living color yeah that was hilarious and also came up a big swinging yeah handyman there's a handicapped superhero what you couldn't do that today never you can do that fire marshal bill get the fuck out of here you can't do that oh that's that's that's just time it when I think about that time it's just timing inside Keane is gonna do a sketch show he's at the Comedy Store his brothers their fuckin Jim Carrey's there yeah david alan grier around free killers you just killers like just waiting for a shot now maybe that together David what's his name uh well got skinny guy Tommy Davidson Tommy Davidson yeah like this all this talent just just needing a shot and a fly girl Jennifer Lawrence Jennifer Lopez Wow and the other Puerto Rican leader the fly girls I forgot a name right now Rosie Perez Rosie Perez like look how much shit came out of that show crazy even afterwards Jamie Foxx came on just yeah careers that are still going man and then there was MADtv where you'd watch MADtv would be on like season to anybody that shows - yeah what the fuck but MADtv had a bunch of great skin to do people just forgot yeah they had really good innovative sketches - and that was like when people were comparing inside Amy Schumer like a lot of the shows they were saying a lot of the episodes they were saying we were ripped off were ripped off from MADtv but part of that is because you've run out of premises like didn't Simpsons like South Park always used to joke around about like Simpsons lately had episodes called Simpsons already did it yeah cuz it everything yeah you're stealing from yourself because you got new writers yeah there's like since it's been on what 20 years maybe longer the east so somebody's who's been writing I think the Simpsons are on the eighties yeah they might have been too close to 30 years yeah so somebody who's been writing on The Simpsons five years just five years which is a long time can come up with a premise that was did in year ten or the Simpsons and not know yeah and everybody there they might have forgotten just it's fuck it let's do it yeah it doesn't matter as long as you could do it yeah right it's like yes yeah no one's I mean there's got to be someone but no one can probably recall every episode of The Simpsons all right that's what I'm probably wrong that's probably some real super fans out there they can do it I'm sure you do there you go Jamie's like ah ah that can ya know for sure yeah it seems like you get to a certain number of episodes of things for sure they've covered virtually at least close to every subject but maybe not you know but the thing about cartoons though is that you could just do anything this it's so much more beautiful in terms of like what you can get away with or kill people they come back to life next week enough to explain it right you know like South Park can do anything you can do any and their animation is so crude and simple they go back together a show in a matter of minutes yeah they can something happen today they can put a show up tomorrow they literally good yeah I mean I'm sure there's such a well-oiled machine and then I those guys work ethic is just insane yeah yeah they Trey Parker guys off the charts hey they got Rock work I think yeah like doing the other brain yeah they're bringing yeah I wonder what that's about like what keeps a person going that hard for so long I know like cuz it can't be the money I wonder me it's got to be the creativity it's just got to be so like that just seeing the finished product but they're also like very socially responsible you know like they'll they'll shit on people and things go bad in the news right and they'll they'll come after people right now I like that about them I do too mmm well that Carlos Mencia Kanye West fish sticks episode Jesus Christ knows when he was on Comedy Central there was like whoa they went hard and Team America world please they do that on the side like Wyatt and Book of Mormon you know yeah just just super creative guys hey man makes you feel lazy yeah there's a lot of people out there parently make me feel lazy I said your your schedule yeah you keep going like how the fuck is he doing this shit coffee coffee gonna have coffee some deep-seated desire to figure things out I don't know I wonder I'd like to do a lot of shit that's not work related to leaning more towards doing more of that yeah I think that after a certain a certain point time I can't keep doing three things can't keep working for the UFC doing a podcast and doing stand-up I'm gonna have to chop it down at two or one someday let me just stand up occasionally just and occasional Stan yeah you mean you get to a certain point you mean do you want to just I don't know I guess stand up I don't really have a burnout feeling because I always create new stuff every couple of years and it's always about putting it together but I mean how many more years you're gonna want to do that okay like so what's like what's your ultimate like later on future goal they say even five years from now like what what do you think would make you happy doing that's the part of the problem I don't have any goals okay zero goals yeah this is my goal do the best stand-up I could do try to do the best podcast I can do do the best job when I'm doing commentary just do the best I could do while I'm doing it joy it that's simple enough yeah that's it I don't really have like you know I want to make X amount of money or I don't I just don't want it to suck all right my whole motivation is don't put anything that sucks put out things that people enjoy figure out a way to make it enjoyable do put all your effort into it do it because I know that if I don't do that I will feel like shit right I know if I like have a show that's not so good and we've all had those or podcasts not so good and I've definitely had those I just don't fit does not feel good right you know I always come out perfect there's no way around that especially like when we're doing these live shows man mm-hm live shows up so many variables the time of the show how tired the audience is how tired you are how you been traveling are you sick no you know there's so many things that can affect like how your performance comes out even if you like consciously try to pump yourself up I've had some bad shows when I when I wasn't feeling good that's hard right when you just don't have the energy or the feeling in the bits the same cuz you're feeling sick well you know bad shows help you get better shows always what they're for you know they're like oh you didn't do think this next time didn't do the work on that you know it is also the sick feeling of like I don't like like a really good show I don't even like a show that's like that's pretty good oh yeah I don't even like that like if it's like I was pretty good I was like oh are we talking Stan doesn't it better yeah I'm always like why isn't it better why isn't it like my best show ever my last show might have been my best whatever and why isn't this one my new best one ever a different audience different place venue I know but I mean that's I think that's my motivation that's what keeps me going like trying to figure out how to wait and then also trying to figure out what to do with my material like should I be writing more stuff here so I just be honing this down like how do I approach should I toss them in this aside and throw some new stuff in there and then bring it back and you know it's constantly trying to you know like when you're creating something like when you created your CD don't you get that feeling sort of will you like okay I got to kind of engineer this a little but I also got to kind of like let it be itself mm-hmm like I just I'm like that kind of before I start doing a joke like if I'm doing a joke and I'm like or if I think of a joke like my elimination process of what I should or shouldn't do starts before I start doing the joke so the joke fits into my criteria then I start doing it so then I'm not wasting time I don't feel like I'm wasting time from the beginning like I think creatively like I try to do the things that I really like to talk about so then I don't have to worry about later on looking at the whole thing as much and saying I gotta lose this and I gotta lose that right so I start early so then the things that I'm talking about I'm already feeling them well it's just sometimes when you hold on to things a long time and you're doing them for a long time you don't feel it then you don't feel it anymore and the audience tells you you're not feeling it anymore based on the reaction you're getting now and from when the reaction you used to get and you could feel that thing getting tired that's why I always say that stand-up is in some of a mass hypnosis it's very similar it's not like know someone's tricking you or telling you what to do or gonna get you to quit smoking not in that way but when the guys on stage like if I'm in the back of the room and I'm watching you and you're killing mm-hmm one of the things that's really funny is I start thinking the way you're thinking when you know you could joke about something it's like I I'm in your groove I'm letting you do all the thinking for me right like if you watch a really good comic like like if I'm watching you if I'm in the back of the room and I'm watching you I don't have any I just let you do all the thinking I know you know I know you know what you're doing I know you're gonna take it down a funny place it's gonna be great here we go and just let it happen but the moment that you don't trust that person anymore moment they fuck up or something goes weird and the spell gets broken you know alright any like oh that guy just fucked up that joke this joke sucks now this jokes not good I'm not gonna let him think for me anymore oh this this subjects terrible all the subjects just gross no I'm just trying to get noises out of me now you know you gotta earn the audience's trust to let you copilot the evening 100% and take over yeah and just relax and listen to you and you could tank it and you bring it back yeah it's possible to as long as you're like real honest about what's happening yeah yeah like was just when Montreal we did a show before so we have a you know your warm-up show so we're going to tape the lol thing and so they give you a warm-up show so I started so do you have eight minutes and there's other comics on the show so in the first I don't even know what jokes I'm gonna do for the lol thing cuz everybody's like what is the lol thing it's like Kevin Hart's new network oh okay and then you're gonna do it eight minute segments on it and the network yeah it's a network what's he gonna put it on I think it's on the Internet okay yeah says hello it says a whole like internet channel and it's all comedy so he's doing scripted he's taping mic stand-up shows with a hole sending things people who have half an hour's on it so I just want to do like an 8 minute segment and during the warm-up show some chick was just talking in the beginning of my set and talking to you or just talking talking to her girlfriends ooh so then the first joke went well but then I had to stop and say are you gonna shut the fuck up oooh and we should you know what I'm gonna have you kicked out and nobody in the club moved and she's I know you're not Wow yeah she said no you know I said alright we'll see we don't have to kicked out I said who's running this shit and this is the 8th missus though I only have 8 minutes right and I got to get back on track she said no you're not Wow so she could thought she just talked yeah she could that's all you know what the club did not kick her out you see us do your whole set with her sitting there yeah but I got them back on track because they did want her to shut up and she did shut up but that defiance I've never and then some common Canadian comic later I was like you know what you should write the club because we have this problem in the club every time but if you write a letter to their own and tell him they never have security here in purple club as us it was a comedy nest Oh in montreal montreal yeah I've been in that spot before does the comedy work still there a little tiny spot I think is still there that place is amazing yes the place upstairs yeah it's like a little fucking room a hot box do it it's like 80 people yeah like maybe I did a one-man show in there like two years ago did like an hour near it was fucking amazing yeah my Charles is an interesting place you know it's a funny thing too like during the festival and he's like it becomes like this really intense environment for comedians a lot of pressure people go there to be seen go there to make deals we get development deals and shit for Montreal it's a weird weird thing we gotta go to another country go into a country that doesn't even speak English I mean in Quebec they were English French French at refuses to speak English yeah well that one section one production yeah but it is kind of like visiting another land it doesn't feel like like if you go to Toronto it might as well be Detroit or something I mean it's a nice city but I mean a little nicer than Detroit sorry Detroit people get mad what Detroit's amazing come on bro okay let's say Chicago might as well be Chicago might as well be I mean it's just another big city mm-hm it doesn't feel like you're in another world right if you go to Montreal you feel like you might as well be in Europe yeah cuz people start instantly talking to you in French yeah and then then they realize you don't know any French and then start talking English without a French accent yeah like how do you know another language how do you know I get you know in another language but how do you do it without an accent yeah how do you do it how do you sound straight up English speaking English you how do you sound straight up French without the English interruption in your French accents criteria yeah how do you good switch yeah I don't haven't been to Montreal in a while man was there like for a UFC maybe a year ago or so I need to get back up there yeah the women are beautiful there man it's an amazing place it's an amazing place cold as fuck in the winter yeah I don't fuck with it in the winter ice two winters up there yeah I can headline I've done shows up there in the winter but it's like in and out like they said two shows that black shows at this club called club soda yeah I know clubs I used to work there yeah is dope yeah that was a nice does a nice room there's a nice spot yeah that's whenever I used to do the festival I used to club soda sorry no sure yeah club soda is great man I did I did the comedy from the danger zone but Damai rarer therefore timing from club soda to taped it way back in the day yeah way back in the day Dom our era and I met in Montreal Charles a great festival man it's like we call it like a comedy summer camp no comics like yeah talk about just all the comics pretty much in the same hotel or spread out pour out a few hotels and you're just hanging out yeah laughing having fun in the lobby everybody goes off to their shows some people come to your shows yeah you just you just having fun man you're working how many does it go it starts at two weeks for second yeah it's almost like two weeks as they start like the ethnic show and some other shows a week ahead then last week was like last week was like the last like the full full-on like regular week the last week is yeah yeah it's um there's not another one they tried to do a couple other ones they used to have an aspen one which is really good I shut down yeah you know why cuz those fucking executives they would just go skiing all day they didn't really want to watch the shows there you go the show's would be tired fuck cuz there's no air and they've been skiing all day yeah I know you've been asked another man yeah and I caught the flu up there the worst flu ever had at the festival yeah cuz it was going around and I was sick and I had to take the TV show and I mustered up enough energy to do the taping and then I just slept in bed for like two days and then I had to check out the I thought out of my hotel at 11:00 but my flight wasn't till like 7:00 oh so I'm like I'm like the worst flu ever that I've ever had and you got to fly with it I had to fly with it and when I checked out this how bad I was when I checked out at 11:00 the guy looked at me and I told him it my flight was that 70s like I'm gonna give you a room so you could sleep in oh wow until your flight that saved my life Wow let's lay down for like maybe three hours no it helped it helped me enough to have enough energy to this and then you at the airport I think the flight got delayed so now I'm like in the airport worst flu ever for like two hours when your immune system is compromised like that to you it's amazing how little energy you have yeah I go people don't that's like a cliche that health is the most important thing mm-hmm you're like fuck up bitch money is the most important right fuck out here with your health I mean coughing counting my cash feeling great not true like hell does everything if you just feel a little shitty just a little shitty it markedly changes the way you look at life if you cut your thumb alright that changes your whole day it could right especially if it gets infected yeah that changed your whole if you start your toe and that shit hurts it changed like any little thing could change your whole day like health without stubbing your toe don't be a bitch bro now but you know like like you know like like some type of hurt or you yeah or just something in any injury I got a headache yeah changes everything yep yeah yeah and surgery yeah my buddy's wife got rotator cuff surgery just fucked up for weeks apparently just can't put your shirt on agony I was like oh no that doesn't sound good yeah anytime something goes wrong but I think like overall health and wellness is so fucking important yeah for sure it's so important it's like there's so many people out there that just don't take care of their meat wagon you gotta you gotta take care of your meat vehicle you have to do you just you know what's really crazy to me like people that I know that don't take care of their body then they talk about being depressed it's like what what did you think you think you just like poor shit down your hole and you would feel good right like just no sleeping tons of cigarettes tons of booze and you thought you'd feel good right you shot right I don't know why I feel sick you don't I just been feeling like shit lately doing the same thing over and over again you take a drugs Wow did you see what the health I watched a doctor's response to what the hell I watched this because I heard it was like some crazy vegan propaganda it's not based on science at all I think they're trying to say that fat causes diabetes and it's clogged up and doctors that have looked at it there's been a ton of debunkers online that have where they said this is pseudoscience this is not real like it definitely a vegan diet can be healthy definitely taking a lot of vegetables can be really good for you and definitely it's good to have nutrient-rich foods right whether it's fresh vegetables or whatever you want to eat and you could absolutely if you if you're careful and you're smart about your saturated fats and unsaturated fats and you know especially essential fatty acids and things like that you could live a very healthy life as a vegan and just do it right but these guys lie not overboard they didn't you don't document what it is is a vegan proselytizing like docu it's like you what you're trying to do is get people to sign for veganism but scaring the shit out of lies and you're saying things like saturated fats and all these these things clogged up in your arteries and that causes diabetes mm-hmm that's not true like in that in this what the health what is the same guys that made cowspiracy yes exactly and they were wrong about that too when they came in here they were talking about how many acres it takes for a cow to graze and all the negative aspects there's absolutely negative aspects mm-hmm when it comes to animal agriculture and I think it's super important to be honest about those aspects even when criticizing it you can't exaggerate it to make a case look better because the actual facts are disturbing enough okay especially factory farming when it comes to like cows and shit and and and pigs it's disturbing to see them all stacked up in there like that sterben see those rivers of shit where where people run these pig farms and they're the shit comes I mean they filmed it with a drone one of these giant commercial places fucking disturbing right and that is straight-up that's enough that's enough there's a ton of actual facts that are disturbing and as soon as you you have these doctors that are just bullshit artists that are saying all these things that aren't supported by science and when this one doctor goes over all the different things and what the health that are incorrect you kind understand what it is they mean well I'm sure they mean well yeah they're trying to get people to quit eating processed meat which is a very good idea processed food is fucking terrible whether it's food with a lot of preservatives meats with a lot of preservatives all that stuff is definitely 100% not good for you but that doesn't mean that grass-fed beef is bad for you because it's not right it doesn't mean that you can't have a healthy diet with salmon and fish you know like different kinds of ocean fish scallops and use that as your primary protein source and then vegetables and have like a super healthy diet because you will you will have a super healthy diet and you know there's a lot of arguments to avoid dairy I think a lot of it depends on the individual a lot of good arguments right a lot of really good arguments really good arguments in terms of your immune system inflammation there's a lot of really good arguments to avoid processed sugar there's a lot really good arguments but I think it's like we were talking about earlier when you were talking about if you found those those scrolls in Qumran you would kind of like wow this is what it's science and I get all the bitches right you know you figure out a way to lean it towards you with these people are clearly on Team vegan which is great and it's fine way to be on Team vegan and do it right is be healthy be nice and be honest yeah that's it be honest good yeah and you're gonna get plenty of those there's a lot of those out there no no I don't want to discredit them and there's a lot of there's a lot of crazy vegans too that are just gonna get it at you and they just decided now they're vegan to just attack everyone who's not vegan I've seen those two that's like that's just humans right that's just that's as human shit human shit so I mean I know a ton of people that are very happy being vegan and you're one of them all right you know and I fuck with you all the time about it but you're a healthy dude you've always been healthy you know you but you do it right yeah I mean I've done it wrong like I've been unhealthy vegan but right now I gotta stop fucking with sodium what's wrong with sodium like this high blood pressure why's that doesn't really happen that's not no no see that's another misconception the misconception about sodium is that sodium is somehow another the cause of high blood pressure there was all put together by some bullshit as doctor one doctor pull it pull up the myth of sodium this is crazy this story because so many people believe causes high blood pressure a lot of it's genetic genetic yeah genetic it could be you know sedentary lifestyle there's a lot of factors it's at sedentary lifestyle yeah you don't really work out shaking up the salt meth here you go Chris crasher was actually been on the podcast before and all the age of salt has been invested with a significance for exceeding that inherent in its natural properties I don't okay that's a little little birdie there single most harmful okay here we go it's been referred to as the single most harmful substance in the food supply but it's salt really dangerous new new news taking up the salt myth actually this is not what I'm looking for what I want you to do is just pull up the conspiracy about how one doctor wrote some bullshit paper about sodium you got that okay time to end the war on salt from scientific America the zealous drive by politicians to limit our salt intake has little basis in science it's all bullshit make that larger please missus so many are like how do we yeah but this is we know what's real and what's not given this is like it started with there's like a very clear beginning for this there was a bullshit study that someone passed and you know there's also been a ton of bullshit is 1904 French doctors reported that six of their subjects who had high blood pressure a known risk factor for heart disease were salt fiends worries escalated in the 1970s when Brookhaven National Laboratories Lewis Lewis Dahl claimed that he had unequivocal unequivocal evidence that salt causes hypertension he induced high blood pressure in rats by feeding them the human equivalent of five hundred grams of sodium today which is an insane amount today the average American consumes 3.4 grams of sodium or 8.4 grams of salt a day scroll up a little ear doll also discovered that the population tends to continue to be cited a strong evidence of a link between salt intake and high blood pressure people living in countries with high salt consumption such as Japan also tend to have high blood pressure and more strokes but as a paper pointed out several years later in American Journal of hypertension scientists had little luck finding such associations when they compared sodium intakes within populations which suggested that genetics or other cultural factors might be the culprit anyway this 1977 study affected the US Senate Select Committee on nutrition and human needs and they released a report recommending that Americans cut their salt intake by 50 to 85 percent based largely on dolls work so there's one dick fuck ruined it for everybody the ones put salt on your fries like you can get off that but this is a salt is a mineral and it's a natural part of like being a human being it's an essential mineral essential mineral it's like when you have endurance athletes and they go on these crazy runs and they do like a hundred miles they take salt right it's one of things they said yeah they put salt in their body and Gatorade it isn't Gatorade a little bit we know what the best version of it apparently health-wise is that Himalayan salt right because Himalayan salt has a bunch of like natural base minerals in it yeah they recommend you take a little bit of Himalayan so I'll just just drop a little bit in your water in the morning put some lemon in there right so so I use that a little bit but I think with vegan food like probably based on my genetics like because they try to make it taste a certain way they might put a lot of fucking salt in there okay so I think so but I could feel something like towards December like in my body whenever I ate so now that I've cut back and I like out cook more mm-hmm and I'll just eat places that have less salt because it's salt and shit but that some people over salt shit it also could be sugar I mean what you should do honestly is I could send you to a guy should get some blood work done all right I did some it was it was it was the guy's had salt when I took too much salt but that's guys a fucking idiot Jesus Christ you went to an idiot doctor you say you have too much salt but these don't find sodium in your blood like what is he saying like my blood pressure was getting hot what a fucking asshole there's not a connection this idiot is telling us to cut back the salt how the fuck are you supposed to trust doctors when they're going to present shit the degree in school even I trust anyone that's my point you can't trust anybody everybody's session doctors your age that motherfucker was in college in the 80s right so what the fuck that's a long goddamn time ago today and he was taught the shit you know 10 years after the 70s people were idiots there were monkeys they had fucking bell-bottoms on the people were barely out of the caves listening in the 1970s yeah have you committed to be a doctor right and you learned everything that you learned you you're your whole identity is bein based on what you know right so if some new shit comes up or you find out that something that you were taught that's embedded in you is not true yeah then you're gonna fight that new truth and you stick to the to the old way because that fucks with your identity right and who you are and how people perceive you to be there's also like peripheral knowledge that people have but I'm guilty of this too everybody is I guess but I'm guilty of it especially like you get a little peripheral knowledge of something and you think you know you understand what it is all right like I was talking to a scientist an actual scientist mm-hm and I was talking about eggs you know we're talking about oh that's got to be fun growing your own chickens and he goes well what about the cholesterol doesn't that uh you know lead to high blood pressure you taking in all that cholesterol like Jesus Christ you're a fucking scientist don't you understand like that dietary cholesterol doesn't even it barely even moves the needle on blood lipids like there's a lot of a sedentary lifestyle but genetics there's all sorts of factors but like chickens like an eggs from chicken they're not bad for you at all in fact one of the most healthy Isuzu can eat if you're saying that chicken eggs are bad for you you're essentially saying that food is bad for you you don't want to see white house bad because they they they shit all over eggs they're idiots they shit all over healthy grass-fed chicken or a free-range chicken it's wandering around look go go leg might be the perfect food there's an article about eggs it might be the perfect food because eggs have a ton of nutrients in them and they're also essentially pretty ethical like ethically free of any reservation said chickens just lay eggs right you don't have to hurt them our eggs really nature's perfect food rotten eggs how a perfect food can go bad what is this this is this the same article I don't think it is there's there's an article it doesn't matter there's an article that I read on how an egg is the perfect food if you can find that it explains like all the nutritional properties of an egg there's just so much it from so many different science all I learned to do is just trust myself so the doctor telling me this thing about salt right fucking it was was kind of like alright I could feel something wrong right I could feel something wrong so that that I honestly felt so when he said too much salt and then I know out a lot let me stop you when you said you could feel something wrong like what are you talking about like what do you what are you experiencing it's just a feeling like like in my veins or a lot jerk I could just feel I got pay attention to my body a lot you know a lonely naked now you just after I ate okay I could feel something it wasn't in it and it was just just like this is no I'm not supposed to feel this way and this was just from eating food mostly when I'm mostly after I ate I'm gonna feel it just carve up a fat snake I want some elk I want some elk call me would you eat it though yeah told you I would because because it's go koi because it's free-range that's truly free-range that's as free-range again the new place when we having a new place setup I'm gonna have one of these Yoder grills mm-hmm like I want those pellet grills oh yeah I'm gonna be able to grill on a spot we will document document Ian Edwards first meat consumption and how many years will be over ten for sure Wow over 10 for sure over 10 dude you might go crazy you might become a hunter Ian's gonna be like shooting shit off the roof yeah it's all rearranged people is that it whole eggs are most that is it whole eggs are amongst the most above the most nutritious foods on earth and so I've made that a little larger there so you could say one egg contains vitamin b12 nine percent of the RDA vitamin b2 riboflavin 15 percent of the RDA vitamin a six percent vitamin b5 seven percent selenium which is an important mineral 22 percent of the RDA eggs also contains small amounts of almost every vitamin and mineral required by the human body including calcium iron potassium zinc maghen a I don't know what that is manganese vitamin E folate and many more a large egg contains 77 calories with 6 grams of quality protein 5 grams of fat and trace amounts of carbohydrates it's very important to realize that almost all the nutrients are contained the yoke while the white contains only protein it's a fantastic food source and here's the thing about eggs man it doesn't hurt the chickens you're not hurting anything you're not harming anything if you have free-range chickens you could just and I know a lot of people can't live you know what if people buy actual free-range chickens or buy free-range chicken eggs you're buying eggs from an animal that's just gonna lay eggs every day or every other day it's not it's they don't get hurt and if you could figure out a way like the ideal thing would be like communities having like coops we grow your own vegetables and you guys have like a chicken coop that everybody kind of helps take care of and these chickens roam around and eat bugs and worms and all the stuff they're supposed to do all right and then you eat those chicken eggs and it's like you get animal protein but you don't have to hurt anything nothing has to die and if you're getting a free-range a truly free-range chicken egg it's super healthy and to say anything otherwise I have to stop and now I can't watch your show I can't watch your movie I can't listen to you talk because you're not being honest like no one's saying vegetables aren't honest there are healthy rather vegetables are super sorry beets are fantastic for you kale is amazing for you carrots onions all these different things that come out of the ground yams sweet potatoes also fantastic for you nutrients it's all important that's worth what's that's real food but so is eggs nothing wrong with eating eggs like my issue was I was just being a bad vegan because you can be vegan and still eat a lot of crap yeah so and in like years of just eating crap is definitely gonna affect you no matter like like when somebody says they're vegan like what are you eating cuz you could eat bad shit oh yeah so I just needed to cut back on the bad shit you know what I mean yeah like stuff with sugar like you know you know the vegan ice creams and just a bunch of shit and so now I could I feel better it's like like the feeling that you were asking me about before it's almost like when you have a headache but your headache is in your body and and most of the time I could correlate it with when I was eating and what I was eating so then now just like alright you've been eating some crap likes I think sodium is good salt is good for you but if you probably take too much it is bad but maybe you wouldn't let me stop you again because when you're sent tell me you're getting blood work done you're getting your blood work done to protect to see if you have high blood pressure you're not getting your blood work done where your check your nutritional levels I think they were checking for everything but do they tell you you need more vitamin B or my vitamin D or b12 or anything like that did some niacin they never said I got to call them I gotta call them okay yeah real a doctor that's going to do a real nutritional profile of you it's going to concentrate on your nutrient intake he's gonna look at like tell you to eat normal and then come in and do some blood work and then maybe they do it again in like six weeks or something like that right and they're gonna check a bunch of different things didn't check your your hormone levels active usable testosterone bunch of different things but real it's really important is checking your vitamin levels alright making sure that you really like there's just people this weird idea that you get everything you need from your diet you might you might get everything you need from your diet depends on your diet and also it depends on whether or not you've checked mm-hmm most people haven't checked huh you don't go to a doctor and check go get yourself checked out find out like your nutrient levels find out what maybe you need some vitamin D maybe you need some b12 or b6 maybe they can find that your body is a low on niacin or maybe they think that you know consuming more essential fatty acids to be very good for you but you can go to a really good doctor a legit doctor that goes over that stuff and is on the cutting edge of today's modern science and they can greatly enhance your ability to understand what impact your diet is having on your body because if you think you're eating healthy and then they do like a triglyceride count on you and they do your your blood sugar count like Sam Harris friend of mine just started he tried to be vegan for a little while right and he got his blood work done like on a regular basis cuz he's smart guy and wants to check his body out and he's like did it's not good alright there's too much sugar the glucose level is a bunch of different factors I forget like what particular it was but he had to switch to eating wild fish alright so wild fish and then mostly vegan of them that cut out the dairy cut out the factory farming you figured it out yeah I mean I just think that there's a lot of bad in modern diets there's a lot of bad in food consumption we don't need to make stuff up we need to find out who's telling the truth and the doctor telling you the you need to cut your salt back and that's what's giving you a high blood pressure that guy is an asshole he's an asshole whether he realizes he's an asshole or not he's not paying attention to the latest shit right he's some dude it's probably just me I don't trust our funders or doctors per se you know saying yeah because a lot of them you know don't like everything else yeah they like everything else it's like trusting a comedian to be funny yeah we all know someone some of them that just there's never gonna happen exactly they call themselves Camille or you don't they off on either being hacky and audience doesn't know they got that shit from somewhere else that's true too yeah there's a lot of hacky doctors out there it's just a bad doctor's man there's a lot of really good ones twos good ones - yeah it's really good ones yeah you just have to find out how old you doctor uh he must've been like maybe around 50 file cam doesn't Google no I don't think yeah look like just drink some hot meals no what is this if you have high blood pressure salt still matters new research examines the sodium hypertension mystery what does it say so if you have high blood pressure salt matters receptor the 81 are mmm okay what does it say 80 are Markel's and your cells and kidneys can continuously where is this coming from first of all Cleveland Clinic and this is an actual study space recently discovered a possible explanation team study the hormone angiotensin angiotensin helps regulate your blood pressure when it binds to receptor called a t1r and turns it on the 81 are molecules in your in the cells of your kidneys continuously regulate the levels of sodium and the blood this relationship can be overactive in some people which leads to high blood pressure there's hope in the forms of a drug called 81 our blockers true to the name these drugs block NGOs angiotensin from binding with 81 are thereby keeping blood pressure lower to make these drugs even more effective researchers want to understand the molecular structure of eighty one arm it's not the number one thing so it's not giving it to you but if you have it it may be a factor so if you I wonder what their levels are they're talking about though so we talking about the levels they did in that test when they were giving in to rats and give him five hundred grams a lot of selling rap yeah you definitely died from eating that much salt I think that we just need more transparency and honesty and it comes to what people actually know versus which like what they're claiming to know right you know when you're talking to a doctor it's giving you shit advice I've talked to a ton I've talked to a ton of doctors and say like you can get everything you want from the average American diet there's no need to take vitamins your p.m. out that's straight up take less shit I'll take B I take K take b12 if you take b12 you know you're probably not really vegan fuck it I'm trying to be I'm trying to be healthy so I don't care where it comes from just as long as a good source and I feel good baby eyelids amen babies should have defended themselves better those babies are here for a purpose what are you like what do you have like a main staple like that you like say if you're at home and you're cooking is there like a main thing you eat a lot like wild rice wild rice or quinoa pasta quinoa is great and uh quinoa quinoa is one of those rare plants that has like a full amino acid profile right yeah it's like camp and a few other ones yeah there's there's a few of those like protein rich plants like like some plants that have good amount of protein in them I play hemp seeds in my that's great my and my smoothies that's good okay and chia seeds chia seeds great too yeah it also cleans your pipes out if you don't man whoa put kale in them you know it's alright you know do you much coconut oil at all yeah cook with it or use it for other shit it's good to add like if you make smoothies and shit like that it's good to add cuz the fat should put some in it helps the absorption of the vitamins all right I had to learn that one the hard way Mead is just adding MCT oil to shakes makes it just makes it more nutritious but I'm gonna be careful long as you will shit yourself you have to be careful you can't you can't go too hard with the MCT oil alright you can get like a few tablespoons in a big glass of but anything more than that it's just something about it your body's like just release the house it's like Lube in your your intestines a little bit it's our but I think it feels like more than that it almost feels it's not just like Lube it's almost like your body's like what are you like too much shot am I'm not comfortable with this let go yeah there's nothing like diarrhea to change your mind on things like if you got all the money in the world but constant diarrhea diarrhea forever you could live like P Diddy like two bottles of champagne one on each hand on a yacht but at any moment you could shoot yourself it's not no nobody can accept that there yeah if you're on that yacht you pay some friends in Sicily and you're like listen I'm rich we can hang out but occasionally I guess I might shit myself yeah and no snickering yeah you can't Matt laugh at me Matt running down this Miami Vice shoes he's get those shoes with no socks almost white loafers dudes wearing she shit dribbling down this is or you have to wear those diapers yeah you have to wear the diapers but then everybody smells it I would keep I would dismount but baby around me like what come on baby yes now go change this baby yeah if you have like constant diarrhea that feeling the only thing that makes diarrhea okay is that you know it's eventually gonna go away right cuz if you just had to live forever knowing at any moment you could just shit yourself there's a lot of people that that's there reality right here people with like Crohn's disease and shit like that they like constantly shitting themselves that's where like butt wipes are very important so yeah you can't be using like some cheap ass Costco toilet paper what's the thing where you just fall asleep automatically narcolepsy it's like narcolepsy of the ass yeah yeah actually yeah what if you had bolt [Laughter] fall sleep wake up cover and shit what the fuck it's like your body's trying to protect you from the fact it knows you're gonna shit yourself knows you can't handle it it's like some drunks become blackout drunks I think it drunks so hard so often their body's like look we can't handle this and still be conscious if you're gonna continue to do this we're just gonna start blocking so when you wake up everybody's gone and you could just get up and crawl home yeah just covered and shot being embarrassed every day you look like you're in the middle your kitchen Greg invited us over to put dinner but uh he shits himself a lot do you want to go to Greg's house to eat Greg he sits down if you're a narcoleptic like what's to stop you from banging your fucking head off the ground yeah that's a problem that's a scary part right yeah you've seen someone faint yeah yeah I've known people that like have epileptic seizures you don't know when those are gonna happen ooh and you have to like stop him from hurting himself I've seen that a lot of planes oh yeah lady behind us just locked up she was just locked up like her body just was like it wasn't working damn and she was trying to fight it off and then they tried to like calm her down and and and I think they try to get her to stop from swallowing your tongue I don't know how they did they have to be that move there was a bunch of people that's around she was like a couple of rows behind me a bunch of people jumped on to stop them from biting their tongue or swallowing yeah and then uh it was like she locked up like like you could see like what she turned around people started like there's a commotion and turned around I was like almost like she was like wrestling with something mm-hmm which is like probably what they used to think right back in the day when someone they thought you possessed by the devil yeah yeah right like if you believe in the devil you saw someone have a seizure all right like Satan is upon her yeah what have they even bothered fixing people back then they might have just killed them kill them or throw them in a dungeon right if you're having a fucking lockup seizure mm-hmm and during the Inquisition they'd be sure there's the devil yeah the devil is taking over you dude that's the line that people don't like to cross the believe in the devil line right right what do you mean believing in it talking about it you talk about God all day right as soon as you talk about the devil like oh boy yeah look II cross the line people are afraid of that yeah yeah but people talk about God people are about God but you usually can't have one without the other the devil is in the Bible so yeah but it shows this the slow cultural evolution that we were talking about we've realized how ridiculous it is to think that some dude in a fiery pit with a pitchfork unless you have one of the people that listens to this and still believed in that that's fine I'm not telling you right you might be right but for most people that's pretty ridiculous right circle did yeah this he's gonna torch you in the fires of hell forever but there's a lot of us believe me believe that shit yeah but it's a package deal see that's what I'm saying it is it's a weird thing that will allow people to not follow the package like no you don't have to buy the wax you could just get the armor all and tires and you don't have to get the the wax part but this is where the devil comes in the devil comes in to help scare people into Christianity so if you're a preacher or jail was witness well it's somebody like if I'm gonna scare you into being it's like scare Street if I'm gonna scare you into being good I gotta take you to prison so you can see what prison is like right if I'm gonna the part of being a Christian is not just being good it's not you don't want to go to hell right so I got to give you these stories of people in hell and paint this picture so that you make this choice and I want you to make so the devil is a very important thing in making people Christians used to be but now things are getting more and more slippery because it's more and more ridiculous because more and more people are making fun of Christianity so now it's like you don't bring up the devil right so I give the president could go on television say god bless america we are a nation governed by God and everybody goes yeah but if he says we have located the devil he's in Afghanistan we're sending troops to that area people like what mm-hmm what the fuck are you talking about man you can't say the devil's a real thing I know I know it's like the problem is the devil if Trump got on TV mm-hmm started saying when I said grabbed him by the pussy that was not me that was the devil speaking through me and now I understand and everybody would clap the devil is in our heart and in our soul and we need to stop him from ruining life on earth before Jesus returns and offers us eternal salvation right you could you could almost imagine someone saying like that but not someone saying something like that but not quite they would like I always think like you ever seen those court cases where somebody said they heard voices yes and then they killed somebody right right Santa frenita schizophrenia so that person's on trial that person's on trial and then everybody's looking at that person like they're crazy right right right but before that the people who testify against that guy testify they have to put their hand on the Bible and swear to a God that they can't see to give testimony that this person is crazy what is the difference yeah he said he heard voices you're swearing to something you can't see so help me God so help me God so yeah what what's the difference yeah you're you're swearing to an imaginary make-believe person right that may or may not have created the entire universe last days yeah they might not this guy's crazy but this guy's crazy yeah this guy's hearing voices of Tom to kill so it's all off from this guy are you yeah who have you talked to God I have a personal relationship with God I talked to God every night that was the thing about Busch T's to drive me crazy when used to say talk to God like listen motherfucker you might be talking to Adam unless God's talk it back you're not really having a conversation because people could be telling me I talked to Joe Rogan every night because you just you listening to Paula let's go shut the fuck up goddamn you can tell that story again you're not really talking to me man right okay you're talking at me I'm not there the last thing George bit did was talk to God every night I talked the last thing he did every evening I talked to God he gives me my plans no I talked to Ian Edwards every evening I listened to his podcast about soccer excuse me I mean football and I fucking start screaming out of it so there is yeah you don't you don't hear too many people saying they actually heard from God cuz that's where it gets slippery like if you talk to God all sound crazy yeah you sound like I'm nut yeah well I got a bit that I've been doing lately about like how no one likes new miracles yeah yeah you know that but I don't even know if I heard that bit but you're right it's like we like old we only believe the ones that happen in the Bible if somebody says this miracle happened to them they're crazy but don't you believe in God well we get to like Joseph Smith Joseph Smith's the that's the the bounds of incredulity because that's the 1800s I think it was 1820 was it 1820 even the golden tablets that contained the work of the last work of Jesus and only he could read them because he had a magic seer stone that he would look through if the angels came and took away like all of it was like crazy miracle stuff but it's like all just long enough just long enough ago well people go well maybe I was still going on back then right yeah yeah 20 maybe but not in 2017 no you can't come no can't come with that no unless you got some super proof but now people not gonna believe that super proof anymore because of all this 3d rendering software and Adobe Photoshop and have you seen that thing we're talking about it yesterday they're able to you could talk for 20 minutes and they'll take your voice and essentially in over 20 minutes they find everything you've ever said all the noises that you can make in 20 minutes or 40 minutes 40 minutes actually they could do it in 20 but they prefer 40 so they can make you say words you've never said before like you could say hey Joe and Jamie let's do a podcast and they could say hey John Jamie and Mike and Steve and Debbie let's do a podcast and you'd be like what the fuck I never said Mike and Steve and Debbie they can make your voice say those things with with new computer software and they can't so what evidence is evidence now in court that's the point the point is it's getting so close to being impossible to tell if something's fake like right now they can still kind of tell it's still a little clunky but it's a few years away from being indiscernible you're not gonna be able to tell make it manufacture anything yeah it's crazy it's it's really it's gonna be really interesting because they're also gonna be able to have people like you won't have to like bring john wayne back to life to have a John Wayne movie you know you could have a fake John Wayne you have hours and hours of John Wayne talking you take that you throw it into a computer and it can you could write a script mm-hmm like you could write a script where John Wayne is in some new high-tech western movie that real-ass star wars the rogue one didn't they do some shit like that after she was dead she made her younger than she already was was it good yes alert by the way son of a bitch I haven't seen that movie when they have bad since Christmas have you guys been paying attention to all that shit Stern that William Shatner has been doing online William Shatner is is at war with social justice warriors on Twitter William Shatner is like shit posting online and getting these people mad at him and they're mad and they're saying that your whole show Star Trek was about social justice and here you are mocking social justice warriors there was an article in Huff Post you know which is like the super liberal like should William Shatner's like aberrant behavior or something like that or a race aberrant erases star Trak legacy like that like litter is bad behavior online find that article because it's so ridiculous but he's essentially just fucking with people call him snowflakes and shit and people going nuts but how bad is he what's he saying nothing that bad no no better I just wanted to toe the line they also want him to be like humble and grateful for being on Star Trek but he's like hey folks it was just a TV show lighten the fuck up and they're like it's just a TV show with social justice as its primary values and here you are we expect you with the comedy so with that TV show they're not yeah he's Canadian too by the way no shit yeah no they're not far now he's wrong yeah but uh I don't know like what they're arguing about sorry I can't scroll back far enough to find I just want to argue oh yeah for sure I think he's awful remember when you didn't know that William Shatner was so awful I guess I'm we got like these weird social justice warriors women like relax hey I waste your time those got shit to do people eighty year old man alone I get you think he's all he's got all these marbles there yeah eighty yeah isn't he is it William Shaq no we should be about what the fight was about came from some show called Outlander okay Outlander fans the actor calling them snowflakes and social justice warriors is intricate and fascinating in a way that only fandom beef involving an internationally famous cultural icon can be but to get the full picture we have to take a trip back in time Victor de Shack mare who acquitted with this guy Hugin Hugh in HEU this is the pair okay it believed that two stars the show Sam Hugin Hugh Kane and Catriona Balfe should date in real life huh there's a group of fans people that love the show that thing of shippers they call themselves fans of a show who want to see the two characters in a relationship they believe the two stars show Sam and cat Rihanna should date in real life and a particularly hardline group of fandom Bolsheviks that believe that they already are dating in secret and Shatner who's acquainted with one of the guys waited into the fray labeling those shippers those people as bullies and calling them out on Twitter it was a move that many fans also saw as its own kind of bullying with Shatner trying to kick a group out of fandom for more nuanced walkthrough there's an explanation blah blah blah fast-forward okay he got in a fucking goofy war with trolls gage yeah oh it's just weird so he's what does it hold itself back up funny how an actress with an impressive resume its belittled by same feminists who say that an 86 year old man telling the truth is a misogynist cat6 I could believe that he's 86 google it take a guess how old you think he is I bet that's right that's a he's in his 80s that's great it's gotta be when you're that close to death do you really give a fuck enough to argue with people on Twitter about who's dating who that seems where he says 86 Wow he's pretty good for 86 yeah it is but like what is that like why are and why are they going back and forth like that seems like such a waste of time you're 86 don't you want to how much time do you have when you're 86 if you're super lucky you got 10 years sometimes old people like to argue get some strength and energy it's like a vitamins mmm yeah yeah just fucking something a fight you know yes stir them up a game yeah like a fucking sport yeah yeah they get tired I just need that adrenaline rush need anger fueled fueled by anger and goes energy it's an adrenaline rush you don't you don't dive into the fray with dorks though that's where like that whole gamergate went crazy you know like when women were trying to there was a bunch of women that were trying to they wanted there was a bunch of stuff going on with video games but they were concerned with sexism and video games and they were trying to censor video games than the you know they're bullying people that believed one way and bullying people that believed another way and then it became a dispute a nerd fight as soon as you get involved in any sort of nerd fight no matter what side you're on it's gonna be some chaos there's a lot of angry people those don't I can't even waste time doing that shit do you fuck with video games I used to but I put that shit away like ten years ago what happened when you quit was a video game just taking up a lot of my time all this fun stuff fuck of video games fuck me fuck blowjobs - I was taking up a lot of my time but then but then porn became accessible and then took that took that video gained time away damn really yeah how much video games and jerking off are you doing that seems like can't do it both man how could you have got to choose one how could you swap them though I feel like your dick I don't I just think it's just time wasted yeah time wasted in and your hands are involved eyes that's Jam coordination have you ever fucked with virtual reality have you ever tried out any of those those points no this point I mean just like trying those those headsets mm-hmm like oculus rift or any of that stuff HTC vive tried those like I don't remember the games up in the places where they have the samples and you could put it on and then try it out a long time ago no I was recently like try to I tried a game at South by Southwest I was trying to like the helicopter was over there and I had the thing on and I was like flying it and try to move it but I don't know what the name of the game was what did you do at South by Southwest I did a show there and then I went to the to the you know the main convention center let me ask you this why should they pay you to perform at South by Southwest yeah yeah they did they have to pay now yeah dude they were not paying nobody weren't for the longest time oh sure you would just go and it would be like he'd perform there I went there I went there twice I went there last year but then that was I was taping a show for Showtime on Showtime paid you show time paid and then I went this year and it was just a show at a club and they paid for that they flew out flew me out put me up and paid for that I got an offer once and what they offered me is if I came down there and did their thing I would get a free pass that allowed me to go to all the shows it was worth like 1,500 bucks I was like are you out of your fucking mind I guess they do it but they don't pay for your hotel they didn't pay for your flight they just offered I was like maybe this is just like one faction of this organization that thinks it's a good idea to offer that to people you know who's doing that bumper shoot what's bumper shoot it's a music festival like I've done Bonnaroo they pay you they fly you out and they put your bumper shoot it's in Seattle it's at the end of August going into so the August 31st going into September 3rd and basically what they're paying me covers my hotel room I have to pay to pretty much fly there and but I go to this music festival it is ridiculous you gonna do it I'm just doing it for the fun of going to the music festival well how would you do that you're going to front you're gonna be in Seattle this Friday night with me hey all right that's right you have to go back for that bullshit yeah Friday night Paramount Theater two shows no don't some tickets available for the second show Joe Rogan dotnet foreign statutory yeah Seattle's the shit though it's an odd place to perform but I'm not going there for free right that's stupid because you know someone's making money they wouldn't ask you to go if it wasn't bad somebody's making money that's just gross that's what they were doing with South by Southwest Duncan did a video explaining it when they offered it to him hilarious did a video with you know that Hitler video where Hitler is like yelling out a bunch of German subtitles mm-hmm and Duncan subtitles were all about like South by Southwest link oh there get people to work for free it's just it's a fucking Airlines it's run by a giant corporation yeah like you can't pretend that's like some hippy sort of no they're making billions I mean he must be this giant right and bumper shoes make it money so what are they doing I don't know they're not giving it to the comics yes yeah we need to come up with our own festival I've been thinking about this oh yeah yeah come up with something to do out here that would kill ya ya know what they're for you kill like run it through the ice house two shows every night both both rooms little room in the big room do it for like a week yeah you know there were definitely some crazy yeah yeah any but do it intimate a small small venue mm-hmm think about it I wouldn't want to organize that though and I wouldn't want to like say no to someone who sucks you know like hey yeah so here's a schedule I'm like why that guy yeah that's the problem yeah there's a problem like I was talking to how magical about that talking about putting together that Comedy Network mm-hmm it's a couple people on its comedy network he's like hmm the fuck no you got to be careful yeah you know gotta be careful putting together a network of people yeah because some people are either unaware or just belligerently don't care they just want to get on yeah and they'll try to force their way in try to force their way in yeah do you uh that's an issue with podcasts people try to force their way on your podcast that morning you they asked you I get that shit all the time people that just there's no way I would have them on right and that corner me right and want to get on the podcast I'm like Jesus what do you think works you just get if I wanted you to be on and ask you they have nothing that they have nothing to lose yeah sure act I want to I want you to watch act with me let's go over together sit down there with a yellow legal pad okay what the fuck is that so there is it's just just a personality conflict is a real problems don't even like the material as much as like who they are right you know some people you just don't some people just not that aware they don't make good conversationalist right you don't want to be around them right especially some people like based on the material like you're not a good conversationalist yeah if you talk about that yeah it's just I don't know I get it I get it people want to promote themselves they want things to go ahead but like sometimes there's like how much be promoting yourself how much you should be working on improving yourself and there's there was always those people that like really good promoters but they didn't have a really good product but they have enough of a good product that the promotion sort of carry their product and the enthusiasm behind it got people into it I call it the hustle gene oh I wish I had more of the hustle gene right you know I mean but then I wonder how much of my creativity would have to sacrifice for the hustle gene and there's a conundrum you know it seems like the people who really hustle aren't as good as the most creative you know that's what it feels like yeah that's what it really feels that does feel like that so that's the scary thing especially the promotional gene yeah the promotional genes and weird one all right you know those dudes that like early on open mic nights they were starting their own open mic and putting up fliers yeah like what how are you so confident you know I'm not inviting anybody for open mic and out of here he showed up at an open mic and did a set oh shit I went back to I didn't do a set we went to Madison Wisconsin to do the weekend at comedy on state and then there's this piece of shop that has an open mic so after the show on I think Thursday night we went to the pizza shop and we put our names on a list but then they ended the show before so it was like I wanted to do it was it too many people that signed up is that what it is everything it was like we got there because we just did a show we got there towards the end and then you know what the few audience members were leaving that's the thing about open mics like some comics are new and they're not that good so how much is our audience gonna sit through you know they might have sat through five bad comics is like to sit through and you might have sat through more oh yeah so then they don't know who's coming up next well that's what's weird about the store these days even the open mic night is packed yeah have you noticed mm-hmm it's crazy gonna open mic night there's a hundred people in the audience hey man you're like whoa but they're putting some of the store comics on those shows - yes Mart there's it is smart but there's some about a like a real regular open mic night mm-hmm it's just who I was like that this is the first sparks from a piece of metal and a rock when you start a fire oh yeah let's take that thing where people trying to make fire kill you back in comedy yeah that's like the first sparks and you see it no I won't it makes me nervous yeah this is kind of nerve-racking I used to do them a lot when I first moved out here just to get stage time because I kind of refused to like audition to get in the Comedy Store at first I was like I've already done TV spot so I got to audition to get in the store until til I really got it and I said you know what you need to get into the store into the Laugh Factory and then I was writing a lot so as I but then when I realized it the night I got into the store was like one of the best nights in show business for me oh yeah right it's like validation yeah you're paid regular yeah and I was like I can work out in 15 minute chunks right material I call my manager has to have just gotten to stories like I've never heard you excited about anything what's the big deal don't you understand I could work out yeah it's the store you get it you're in Mecca yeah that's what it is you know when you pull into that parking lot and you get out and you go say hi to everybody you wander through those hallways you see bars killing you go into the main room act someone's crushing you go upstairs the bedrooms someone's upstairs smashing it's like you just stepped into the comedy Mecca right you know and to be a part of that to be allowed to be a part of that and it's funny is like there's so many up-and-coming young comics that want to get in there and look up to it you know now I know it's like it's just just bananas it's interesting seeing it again right we're talking about the other day what it used to be like yeah that's what it's like now there's the Golden Age yeah I got in there when it used to be like and I was still excited because I just knew I'd be able to develop there right you know so that was that was useful like when I started because before I kind of wasn't taking comedy serious and then like I kind of this got tired of it and kind of fell out of love with it were you doing a lot of writing - yeah I'm gonna do so much staff writing no you're showing up at that job every day writing it's like sometimes it just takes away your motivation for sure it did it did and then then I like some reason I said he's trying to get back get into these clothes The Laugh Factory and the store and started my desire started increasing I stand up you gotta put on a special Sun yeah I know what are you gonna do on I had to just shoot it myself like you've been telling me yeah yeah hopefully by the end of the year a few months yeah do it but definitely yeah these needs to happen people here see you're set and then you need to throw it out and write new shit - you know it's like you're sure you're too good yeah I'm sitting on stuff because I haven't used it yeah so but the only way to write new shit like I have new shit but I would have morning shit if I had a special and got rid of the oldest shit well you know what I want to do man after I do my next Netflix special I want to do like a Rodney Dangerfield type thing where I bring up a bunch of what I think are the best up-and-coming comics and I'm like a special like Rodney Dangerfield used to have those whole HBO yeah I want to do something like that all right well I'll just host it all right just throwing people up that's my next move yeah exactly yeah doing all that the ice house cuz Rodney Dangerfield used to Dangerfield's in New York City yeah yeah yeah man you ever worked that place yeah it's a shithole yes it's not what it used to be nice one though it's a great old place yeah dad great cheeseburgers they're the best cheese in New York City man when you used to work there used to be able to get a cheat I was excited to eat a cheeseburger there they're amazing cheeseburgers you do like ground filet mignon or something like that then stuff with simple like when I need to do a spot at the strip like on a Monday night after you pick the number out of the Hat on a Friday and you get one Monday out of the month to perform and then me and the open Mica's were like let's go to Jackson Hole and eat a burger like a midnight yeah and just like you just felt so pushed you know just just doing this artist thing or this comedy thing and you eaten like you heard about Jackson Hole or just some
