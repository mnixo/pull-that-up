- one young bill burr paper tiger coming out tonight on net exciting are you pumped yes I am I'm very excited I think more just to see you know just to people see how good it looks it was Mike binder directed it and uh you know I I just I don't know I just had this idea for how a special I wanted it to look and none of it really had to do with other like necessarily comedy specialist more like rock concerts that I saw and that's saying it's all like super jumpy and stuff but just sort of like I don't know that's weird how the way they shot shit back in the day where they held shots longer so it sucked you in so you kind of felt not necessarily that you were there but the presence of being there and I really have a disbelief that if you fucking go edit really quick quick quick quick quick it's like flipping through the channels and each time like your brain resets yeah and like when you go to a show you're just sitting there looking at the band or looking at the comedian like that it's not like I'm here now I'm in the balcony now I'm behind you now I'm up here and all that so we tried to make sure like the pacing of it I explained it to him he was just like I get it he's a comic so yeah that certainly helps yeah so the way he did it I hope that people see that as opposed to the shit that they normally do like how can I get offended well they definitely get offended it's a it's a sport now to get offended by comedy seems like people get excited to be offended I know a lot of the questions I've gotten out from people non comedians that have been about you know well within the light of Dave special is this like once you guys are mad at Sebastien like a week ago now it's Dave were they mad at him for the mvh one thing no they weren't one person got mad and wrote something and then everybody oh yeah oh yeah I didn't realize I didn't like that I don't like that what was it I didn't hear a peep out of that did you hear what your to start it back up for me try to get him get him all going again it was just like I don't know why he did that anyway I was like those things are never fun you're you're you're basically you know you're the host of what's a commercial for a bunch of bands it's just he's a great comic he sells out Madison Square Garden and he did a great job - yeah he did a great job somebody was talking about four times in two nights yeah which is crazy turned over Madison Square Garden like a comedy club yeah like he's doing an improv show Saturday come see me square it said uh oh yeah Madison Square Park in the round there was no other way 18,000 people yeah 18 times well I say cookie could have done giant stadium he could have he really could have but it's like why why bother why bother doing the vh1 Music Awards it's just it's not a good venue for comedy it's not a good like people see him it's not you know why because Eddie did it Chris did it I'm gonna talk too much to keep this fucking thing going and it's like Al it's a legendary old-school stand-up gig you know you know it's one Music Awards now is MTV was it MTV Music Awards oh they're all the same to me does vh1 have their own Music Awards they don't get me I might've else I would own you know what I'm talking about doesn't making CDs sellin CDs after the show I know I still remember that MTV was cooler than vh1 does your via Jaguar have a CD player no didn't like my car doesn't have one either all right my Tesla doesn't know a fuck let's try and do the math is he subtly insulting me no you got a cassette tape anymore I'm a VCR in the trunk somewhere along the line they just stopped making them well that's the thing you know what and I was in New York all summer and all those all those the up-and-coming rappers are like trying to hand you a CD it's like what am I gonna do with that they still have CDs well then they do something then they just click on this to scan this and it goes to like a Vimeo page and then I'm like because this guy in my phone now like what just happened does he have my contacts yes so I just kind of steer clear to them I can't weirded out by those little Q stand things is that what they call them was a cute Q what was it QR code QR code I get weirded out by those things because your camera goes on it and then boom it opens up a website I'm like what has happened here I'll tell you what's a weird one is they have home security systems now where I was reading an ad for this on my podcast and I was thinking like afterwards like like a lot of times home I guess I know alarm goes off because your window blows open and then everybody fucking shows up and it's like oh sorry the window blew open this actually has video cameras so they can confirm that somebody is in your house but then I'm thinking like well what's to stop them from just turn that on and start watching your life like a show nothing like a hey they're fighting again well for sure if there's a stream it's possible for someone to do that for sure if there's a stream no no and the contract it says we would never do that oh okay it's not like some people don't do that doorbell camera from ring has partnered with 400 police forces extending surveillance concerns yeah yeah yeah I mean as long as they're just using it to catch the bad guys which is gonna be what they're saying but there's gotta be somebody somebody has their dick in their hand right now get through that doorbell it's an act and the way people get obsessed like and then then you're jerking off just to the woman walking up to the door to go into her house and it's not enough man I can see what's up I got to see what's behind the door calls up hey would you be interested in furthering your security no I think the doorbells enough interesting you say that we just had a case the other day where unfortunately she thought it was enough and it wasn't really and then tells him that now he's watching her eating corn flakes it's a slow creep into your life how much time before it's everywhere before everyone can see everyone everywhere yeah I don't know well what's weird is younger people that have a much different idea of privacy yeah because they shit has kind of been out there I would not want to be young right now they have a real tough time we're through when I was younger when I got my ass kicked it was over it wasn't video documentation for the rest of my life this is the kid from Rocky Point he's all grown up now and you're trying to get laid in a bar like 20 years later you like gas that happened I was I was eight sorry I was just thinking of that I watched this kid tried to throw a triangle up in a street fight and the guy slammed him on his head and punched him unconscious and kept punching him while he was out and the kid just climbed off of him and walked towards his friends and everybody's like oh oh this guy's lying on the ground pulling up his arms like probably experiencing severe brain damage and I'm thinking what if that was my son you know what does your son you want some some guys slam I'm on his head and then as he's unconscious punched him five six seven times in the face yeah that's fucked it's fucked that's why I stopped fighting that's why yeah I wanna hurt anybody no no I didn't want to be that guy I was like baby fat tough until like fucking sixth grade and then I sort of leaned out and I was like I better get funny and then that's when people started to learn how to fight and there was blood and shit and I remember there was his dude I think I talked to all this stuff I got up the kid got off the bus he was fucking jack the other kid was kind of baby Huey big guy but the other kid got off the bus first he just jumped him and then just sat on his chest and it was it was like oh those fucking fights the kid didn't come to school for a week they came back to my time he came back to school most of the swelling come down but I almost looked like he was a cousin it wasn't him yeah and I was just like yeah I'm not I don't I don't want that to happen to me so that's one of the darkest things that ever heard anybody say about a fight khabib never going off said about Conor McGregor he was I want to change his face yeah see there's people out there like that that are like yeah there's this that okay I should stop now is missing and you don't want to be underneath all of that they just kept getting worse the older I got that sound of somebody's head hitting the floor the worst and Sam WorldStarHipHop videos where well the worst one I ever saw was this guy was drunk and he was talking shit and one guy knocked him out and then when he's out called lying down everybody took shots at him I mean everybody in the street people were kicking him in the hand were running up to him and kicking him like a soccer ball punched him in the face I mean like 10 15 people doing it just running up to a boom running up punching them oh yeah horrific how did we get on this I don't know I got a great special code yeah you're telling me special is nothing to do with brain damage or random acts of violence why'd you decide to do in England um cuz I'm a Zeppelin fan and it really it was about doing it at that I didn't I just wanted to perform at that venue Royal Albert Hall yeah so then I performed there and I had a great time although I was in my head for a long time like during the show I was like I'm standing where Robert Plant was standing and John Bonham's drums were fuckin right there and I really had a hard time because while you were doing stand-up yeah how many shows you do I just did I just did the one I was in June of last year wow you only film one show no no no no that that's the first time I did it so then you know some of my reps came over I was just like wow this place is amazing I mean it was it was incredible and we just started talking just going thinking maybe could shoot especially I was I don't know I was like huh it's my shit gonna work over here would be different you each special I try to make it be a little different a different vibe you know Southern crowd northern crowd West Coast east coast or whatever so we just kept talking about it and then I talked to binder about it and it all just became about me and him smoking a cigar in London I was like I fuck it let's do it and then the whole way up I was questioning going did I fuck up was this fucking stupid I should have just shot it in the States and then I'd be like no no not was a good idea it's good idea wait a minute what I would have what if I don't fucking and just you know which probably ended up being a good thing for it but um you know I did a run of dates leading up to it before I shot over there and I kind of knew what was gonna work and I knew what wasn't gonna work and then you know people who are showing up there listening to your podcast so they get like the references and stuff because I was talking to somebody go surprise you know they got a lot of those references it's like well that's a specific crowd coming to see me if I did all of those jokes in front of just a random London crowd I think of people you know right the fuck's this guy talking about where'd you do gigs before you did London when you did a run at gigs did you do him in yeah I did a Liverpool Manchester Glasgow I can't remember and then I did one other one beginning with a B I forget you know it was just literally Bam Bam Bam and I got sick when I was in Liverpool I don't know what happened they ate something before I got there or whatever and I had like this stomach virus I had it the night too when I was shooting it I was like getting over it and so that was like this always and I was thinking is there always something or might just that age that there always is something but I just don't notice until the night there's cameras here you know what I mean when everything's heightened yeah oh my god fucking threw my back out never fucking fails special bah bah bah bah it's just like well I throw my back out a couple times a year except I'm just not shooting that night so I don't give a shit and I just joke about it so why don't I just do that when I go to do it so how many shows did you film we did two and it wasn't the same night either so it's kind of weird rather than make bam bam so you're warmed up I can't even get going both times so and like most times it was the set that I liked better it was probably I think the second night so most of its from the second night and then there's just a couple just because it went a little too long I just I just wanted to get in kick the shit out of him and get out leave him wanting more the old school thing so there was just a couple I didn't we just took just a couple things just to kind of splice one section out of there and splice the things and then get it going so how many seats I don't I don't remember I don't think please I don't remember but I do know the night of the special like I I did this thing I was making fun of that whole support the troops sing and everything and what had happened was it wasn't working and it was killing the whole time like you got to be fucking kidding me finally go to record this shit I'm above bla bla and it turned out that some terrorist group had made a bunch of fucking threats or something that day oh yeah and nobody told me oh you know well don't tell him I don't get any fucking hits now if they're going like why isn't this working I suddenly not funny well like it didn't work but it there was just this thing hanging in the fucking air had I known that I would have addressed it and then it would have been fine so we just we just spliced that little you know six seven minutes out of there that's a great bit though I love that it is but I recorded at Madison Square Garden for just like a double vinyl I'm gonna do oh real yeah yeah I'm into all those old school rock pieces like I lose my ass I'm gonna lose my shirt on it but it has that bit on it didn't you do that before like at Radio City or somewhere you did another album in the past was at Radio City I did one at a Carnegie Hall and then the last time I did Madison Square Garden I didn't explain it to them correctly that I was trying to record to do an album there and they just took the audio from the board so I'm just like super loud and it sounds like I'm trying to eat people lesson learned Arius yeah so I like doing that like nerd out comedy shit like I love all that stuff like I just saw Tarantino for the second time I cells once upon a time in America and I went down to his theater that he bought that Beverly cinema and they had all this cool merch from the movie like you know buttons and posters and t-shirts and shit I didn't buy anything cuz I'm trying not the Hat because then I get sentimental when I can't fucking throw it out it's like hoarding yeah yeah does your wife get mad at you for shit like that what hoarders she go why did you bring this home did you not the one who says that oh I'm the one who goes like okay now what are we throwing out not throwing out because then it ends up in the fucking ocean where are you gonna bring that where someone can actually use it yeah so now like whenever I do whenever I do like comedy festivals or anything and they have that whole merch bag I just say I don't want it yeah good for you yeah well we got a phone charger faggot yeah that's not gonna work in a couple years cuz I'll have a new phone and then I just have that thing do people send you a lot of shit like no does the podcast you don't get t-shirts or stuff like that occasionally but I kind of put it out there like I just need you to listen that's enough I don't need you to because then what something 1/2 what sucks is when people really take time to make something right and now it's like I can't leave this behind and it's always big and awkward and I kind of fuck am I gonna get that my back and then you show up at the airport with some big stupid thing with your face on it like the fuck is with this guy that's always weird with someone's wears their own shirt when a comic or a musician or something yeah I had a guy who I really like zubi he was here the other day rapper from England he had his own shirt and his own hat on it wasn't such a great guy I would have given him a hard time I just you have quite a few listeners so he's getting a free free advertisement out of it I would imagine I don't know well he was getting advertisement of the whole podcast I would imagine right you don't have to I guess me everybody's got their own fine way of doing shit so I don't know but I've been having fun I got to tell you I was so envious of you earlier this year because you put out your killer special and just watching you getting to do my favorite thing you know dump the shit I'm sick of and try like the new stuff so that's where I am in my act and I you know I follow you on all the stuff and I was well I think around May or something June you said alright it's ready to go and I was doing an acting gig and I couldn't get the sets that I wanted I was like fuck man that's what I want by getting it I got to get going on this ship because people watching I gotta fucking follow you sometimes down the store which is never fun well we're doing gigs together this Thursday we're doing the improv and the store I'm very excited about that yeah I've been doing a lot of these kids my lightsaber goes up about this far right now where my act is I go to turn it on things how old is your act now like the actor working with um I look I can I can go down I can I can murder with 20 and then the rest of it it gets a little we get a little lost at sea and a piece of plywood you know yeah it is it with people haven't paid to come see you so what I will do is I'll stay adrift a little bit and then I'll just do shit from my special but now as of you know today at midnight I feel I won't be able to do it so so now that's gone so then you still be able to do the troops bit because it's all in there I won't do it because I did it already and it's coming out on something and I also feel like most places I'm gonna go to I already did it in that city right and I have this paranoia that this exact same people show up have never had fans come and sit in the front row two nights in a row and you see them I've had people back-to-back shows an eight and then a 10:30 and then I sitting there it's just like and they're just sitting there the rabbits already in the Hat it's a body double they they know everywhere where it's going Teddy Bergeron bit he's wearing a wire he's wearing a wire Santa Clauses it really is wearing a wire how good was that guy people don't know he was one of the greatest of all time he really was I saw him when I was an open mic and I almost quit he keep one up on an open mic night oh yeah and Bill McDonald was those his name yeah that's funny those early on guys can make you want to quit oh my god yeah he was so good he was so polished I felt like such a slob no the thing about him a shoe was it was effortless and he made it look effortless it was just effortless he just went uh John Pinette was a guy I saw well I was just like it didn't make me want to quit but I was just like I was just like what the fuck was that yeah he went up on a Tuesday at Nick's yes and it was like fucking you know there was like maybe 30 people this place held 400 people is just like a lull it was like when I started was the 80s hangover and just stand up was dead there was like 30 people as a bunch of you know bitter comics ago this place used to be packed he'd be lying around the block you should quit all these fuck so fucking Pinet just dropped by rest his soul he just dropped by and he went up and did 12 minutes and got a Stella jet it wasn't oh yeah John Pinette thank you for stopping by you're famous it was he fucking murdered I think that was the first time he was kind of it was that era when he was doing that you go now buff a bit yes where it just keeps every time you think it got to the height of how funny it could be it went to another level and then another another the only time I ever saw a guy maybe I got like Regan or something with a just had that he just repeat that thing I I was doing a tour with Norton Attell and Jim Breuer and Jim Breuer had a bit never cursed about his dad shouldn't spend his dad shit his pants and the thing he kept going back to other than you go now was the like he was gonna puke dude I remember the first time I saw him do that I was in Atlantic City and I was standing there was a wall behind me and I slowed I was laughing so hard I started sliding down the wall I was holding my stomach going fuck what is that bro is an animal he's one of the most underrated comedians of all time the worst I ever ate it coming up ever following Jim Breuer in like 91 Boston no no we were at a comedy loft I think in Nanuet New York and I should not have been headlining I've been doing comedy I Bobby Kelly about those gigs those gigs are you shouldn't have been hand are you worried I've been doing comedy maybe three years four years maybe maybe four I just wasn't ready no way but my manager was good and he got me a gig as a headliner he's just decent Milo and Breuer was meddling mmm-hmm we were fine I was fine until late show Saturday night when I tell you he went up like just like a man possessed and he used to have this bit about coming home drunk and his mother was a demon you know do you remember the bit no but I know his talent so he's already doing drunken and that demon voice he's gonna do it so his facial expressions and and he just caught it he just caught it where it was like I mean he had murdered all week he had murdered all week but I'd gotten by like I did not have as good as that as him all week but I got by it was good good enough no not embarrassing Saturday night Late Show let me on fire championship round let me on fire I walked on stage early I'll supposed to 45 minutes I think I did 35 it was death 35 of death nervous feeling like an asshole wedding haribol terrible turn like shaking it took me forever to recover it took me weeks weeks I had one one time I just did Vegas whenever I go there I always go by the the Trump right that's what is yeah yeah I got I was contracted to be the headliner and I got bumped down to the middle act oh I got demoted who was the middle I don't remember but he was great and it was Frank del Pizzo was the was the host and he was like a seasoned headliner the other guy was a seasoned headliner and I just said I don't know what that was some young guy they were giving a fucking shot to so I went out there this is like the late 90s and I had my shiny black button-down I'm playing Vegas shirt you know and my manager at the time gave me shit about the shirt on you're gonna wear that okay yes fucking Vegas you wear whatever you want so I walked into the club and it was just where the Trop was then it was like an older crowd because they hadn't redone it or whatever so it was just like they're dying off crowd so dude I went up there and I I did sort of okay I just did okay but they both had better sets to me and then that was the Tuesday or the other Wednesday and then the Wednesday I came up and by then I started to have another not good set and then I got in my head like like I'm not gonna be able make these people laugh and I remember just seeing like there was just this lady back towards the kitchen and like her old lady you know that hair that looks like it's flammable funny it was just backlit and that's all I could see dude and I just went in and out of like like bombing and so then was at Thursday morning comes I'm flying my girlfriend out at the time so she could see my big headlining set in Vegas my name is out on this sign right and I remember she caught I don't remember her name but she called me up she's just like bailet so-and-so from the the Trop how you doing I'm like good good she goes yes so how do you think it's going I said she said I was like you know things go pretty gang of crows little old last night a little bit she just goes yeah you know I don't I don't think it's happening and you know I I think it'd be better if you just midweek he's still gonna pay the same money she was real that was the worst part she was really nice about it and uh then I had to go down there that night my girlfriend was coming in the next night I had to go down there and uh you know I just never coming in and Frank was looking at me and I he was sort of looking at me like how is he gonna handle this and I just was this I I guess I sucker what am I just real and then they were they were both they would never mean to me they would never mean to me a both really really cool guys and we had like a great weekend but then my girlfriend came down and it was just like I to explain to her why there was another person going and me did it go better with you as a middle oh yeah you know you know what it was yeah it went better and then by the end of the weekend I figured it out but I was never funnier than the headliner or Frank I just wasn't I just I wasn't seasoned I didn't know how to do it and it was my first weekend in Vegas and is that true I think it was it was my first weekend in Vegas because then in the next few years I would middle at The Improv at Harris so that was the thing you know it's funny was I was really depressed about it and my girlfriend didn't care you know we still here we gonna have a good time whatever and then I was almost getting like upset with her that she didn't understand who instead of being like oh wow you're really cool that the reason you came out here was because you just wanted to hang with me I was too young and angry and self-involved yeah it's hard when your girl sees you bomb - well fortunately she didn't see that she just saw me middle-middle that's not bad it could have been worse yeah she could have been there while the whole thing went down I guess I don't know one of the worst bombings in my life I was working with jb smooth who's fucking phenomenal and i was supposed to be the headliner but it was a weird college gig in the middle of nowhere in Jersey and it was hard to get to and there was no GPS back then so you had to follow directions right remember those give you a piece of paper yeah they'd call you okay you gonna take a right out here and the left there and then you take the one on one so I said about the person doing the bad directions where they would go okay and then you're gonna see a farmhouse on the right it has a red door and there's cows out front they all right am I gonna take it right there no you're gonna keep going and they just kept bringing up shit that you were gonna see it's just like fine you just like just tell me the fucking thing that I'm gonna see when I turn is it grassy hill and there's there's there's a scarecrow white right now you're gonna keep going it was just like all right sorry no words noise so I miraculously got there on time but JB did not and so they go well we're gonna wait for Jay because he's not here yet so I go okay they go well we have a lounge you can go sit there and watch TV so I watch TV and it's a special a new special on the Malibu fires so this is probably like whatever 93 or something like that some gigantic fires now as before 93 it's like 91 92 and there was a fireman the fireman was weeping because he had saved his house but his neighbor lost his house and he had saved up all his money to help build this house this guy you know it was like his life's work to build his house but he was devastated because he was a fireman and his neighbors lost their house this guy's weeping he's weeping about his house and then they had this fucking kid calling out for his dog they couldn't find the dog they lost the dog and they were hoping the dog got away to safety so there's kids walking around rusty rusty just walking on the street rusty rusty then lady opens up the door JB's not here so we're gonna have you go on first I'm like oh no so I went onstage thinking of that kid calling for the dog and the fireman crying and I just ate shit I mean I just went I had nothing all right there was nothing to do an hour no I wound up doing I want to do I think I'm supposed to be 45 minutes I wound up doing the 45 minutes and I mean I ate shit I did not I did not get any laughs I don't remember I mean I was depressed I remember thinking I could never do this again I did it one other time too though I could never do this again it's fucking terrible to make matters worse jb eventually got there halfway into my said he goes on after me and and murders I mean murdered nuke the room flattened it these kids were so tired of me there was and I was like look I fucked up i watch this to pray and they were so excited to see me because you know they have those college conference things where you go like nafta or whatever it is and you go is that what it's called what are those things called NACA those no you just maybe forget it you know then a yeah so there's something college campuses whatever the fuck it is he's never forgot that my life - you just said NAFTA after it's over now I'll never remember it someone screaming it there's a comic out there screaming it into their their Kaka NACA that's right so um I did NACA and murdered I mean murdered they told me look you can do it slow infrastructures forms Hut sets they they said look mmm I remember having a conversation my agent she said look I know you're you're not clean but if you're clean you can get a lot of gigs you can get a lot of gigs that was the big I mean it's just people are eating shit they were eating shared the conference because all these comics were like nervous and I said you know I'm doing my club set I don't give a fuck I'm not I'm not a clean comic I can't do this I've already done this before I tried and I went up and I did all sex material and fucking murders so these kids were so excited to see me and I got there and just a shit oh no they and they they were blunt way to this guy oh wow he's gonna be huge someday oh my god H it so hard I'm just picturing you doing all your sex material compress bah-bah me ever not just bombing like banging a girl doggystyle day old but it's this is how you do it not this scoliosis thing I know that bit would fucking murder not that night I remember that and then every chick in the room wanted to fuck you and then I would go on stage with my orange afro Hey anybody hi yeah mmm yeah that I ate yet and one other time I ate shit real bad I was headlining as well this is like just this one is not nearly as bad as the other to eat shits the Jim Breuer one was devastating but in all fairness it was good for me because it changed my act it made me realize like you got to respect people's fuckin attention span you can't go up there thinking about yourself and trying you gonna respect these people paid money work hard but you got to be ready and you can't fucking take headliner gigs when you're not ready to headline yeah I remember I did the same place a year and a half later and fucking murdered and I was so happy I was so the guy said Wow you fuckin got better am I thank you thank you saying all this one out the other time where I ate shit I acted a conspiracy theory book about JFK then I've fucking loved this was called best evidence by David liftin this buddy of mine who's in a band to hold the pale horse that's great rating before you go up we kind of came here well I read this and I was like oh my god they shot JFK it's the fucking the government he said the casket was empty the fucking they did they changed the autopsy I had all this shit in my head and I was you know 25 so I was by some guy who wasn't there well I was written by a very credible guy who was actually paid he was at count n't and he was they hired he was so inside they let him look in the casket they said listen I'm just gonna show this to you there's nobody in here yeah we did it the hired mouth shut to go over the Warren Commission report but they never expected anybody to read the entire report cuz they're poorly fucking nine hundred volumes or some shit just an incredible amount of pages but this guy went over it with a fine-tooth comb and he's like this whole thing was horseshit like the whole Warren Commission report was horseshit they concocted all these different things so I went on stage with this this thing in my head like oh my god there's evil people running the government they killed Kennedy and I'm the guy who's gonna save everybody so I ate shit on Thursday night and and then I you know they were very they're a little uneasy with me because they knew I was like I was a re was doing well at like I was a comic they were looking forward to seeing right and then the next night I apologize I said listen I fucked up yesterday I read this conspiracy theory book it'll never happen again and I went up and killed the next night but I knew I knew I'd fucked up I knew it was a mistake I was just listening to ac/dc only time you as funny I listen to them on the way over here then I'll never get over cuz I got the new tool album and it's fucking unbelievable and but I always end up just I can't get out of that fucking orbit I just ended up going back well it's such good shit man it's such good when out when I need a really pick-me-up I listened a whole lot of Rosie oh yeah yeah that'll get you how fucking good is Dean Del Rey's voice how fucking good is his voice when he was singing that oh yeah

these matches from the that's how easily like accidents you should just do heroin fuck these cigars okay Joe the from his motorcycle accident well that's a serious flame you got going there buddy oh yeah something like that it's kind of his story so I'm not really sure I know I was joking with him I go you realize yes unbolting distancing left from his motorcycle accident oh so you realize half of that is the motorcycle and the other half is you being a frontman of a fucking rock band banging your head for fucking two and a half decades he laughs yeah I worked with them this weekend out in Vegas he fucking killed but I noticed I'm trying to sit up and kind of be a little straight but he's definitely getting through it and we hung out or next day and we saw Elton John cuz he's on the farewell toast fucking unreal was it good three hours no opener starts with a hit play it was like closing bits for three hours and then watching how he moves he stays pretty much at the piano but watching how he moves its shit and then they show like the old highlights where he was like in these fucking platform shoes just slamming the piano and pushing himself up like you know almost bending over backwards coming down he do like three four times in a fucking row look at him there yeah oh there you go yeah and like when he walked look you just I just respected the shit out of him when I saw him walking looking like an NFL running back going this fucking guy now he realized people paid money oh you mean looking like a current NFL running back no no no I want him like like when you see those guys uh not the guy was getting elected into the Hall of Fame the guys who've been in the Hall of Fame for ten years when they come walking up to hug the other guy and all this shit kind of settled off yeah but like those piano rotates and everything smoke fire oh yeah just jam and on that things like wow I actually missed that part I was at the Steak and Shake or something speaking of tool and rock related injuries you know Maynard when he's on stage he stomps his foot on the ground like stomps like you know he's always like stomped when he sings well he's a jujitsu guy and he was having a hard time like working on certain moves he's like my fucking hip it's like something wrong with my hip mm-hmm one of how many get a hip replacement from stomping on the ground he stuck his hip out do you know how Kogan would he back when we doing the Opie anthe show he came in I was like I thought this guy was like six seven yeah yeah and his buddy he was like six four in his arms hung down to his knees though yeah and he ended up saying that because of that finishing move II did what he would leap up in the air and just land on his ass night after night after night week after week he lost three inches in height yeah all these discs yeah I got so compacted yeah all your discs deteriorate from from wrestling like almost every wrestler I know including me I have a bunch of disks they're all fucked up but they're there okay enough or I can get by and I use machines like if there's a machine called a reverse hyper or it sort of decompresses your spine I do all this spinal decompression shit actually and I get Regina keen once a year which is like this it's like an advanced form of platelet-rich plasma actually got it today I've got like little band-aids I'm gonna fucking outlive all of us listen I've got the cash to pay for this shit I fucking take everything what do you got what do you got that works your body's like a restomod it's like you look at him and he's 50 51 but underneath it's 20 19 he's got a little ipod jacket is fucking chest people don't even know what we're talking about we take an old car like my Corvette that's not out there but my Corvette that's what it is so I got 1965 on the outside but the inside is all mm it's all the suspension is all brand-new modern chassis I like it the underneath I don't like the interior also to look right like me too yeah it has to look like like yeah speaking of that that's another reason why I had to go see the that Tarantino movie twice effect for that was fucking amazing was I was so busy looking at all the cars and it has one of my favorite cars of all fucking time I'm not a speed guy I like cruising and there's a 67 Cadillac Eldorado in the color that I want and that's one of the meanest looking fucking cars what color was it in the movie it's like this I don't know what I got yellow or something Dean asked me he's like what's the factory color you know he knows it you know he knows all of it but he knows it right it's like a it's like this no no that that's that's that's uh that's a hard car doesn't he have a soft top in there no no you know what I'm thinking of I'm not sure Sharon Tate's friends just look up Cadillac Eldorado because they're just gonna have yet the car Brad Pitt was driving through lien this is Leonardo DiCaprio's best work oh it's amazing and it fuck you got a seat again he's a man I'm actually gonna see it for a third time to catch all this shit and I don't want to ruin it for anybody but you why I'm not gonna say anything put so Leonardo DiCaprio has a different one than Brad Pitt does well Brad Pitt's character driving Leo's car Oh is the yellow one that he's in that not sure what he's well no no but the the Eldorado which I think is this 67 is it when a Sharon Tate's friends pulls up to our house in it oh okay okay - scene yeah those old Cadillacs are fucking phenomenal good luck get one of those into the comedy store parking lot though there's no room for anything else I would like to do yeah just have the under everything be brand new underneath and then just yeah I just driving the fucking right lane smoked a cigar you can get it done I know no I can't but I that's a slippery slope oh I'm already down it I know you are hey you want a warehouse that's the slippery slope so I have my old truck and like I like going fast if I was like at a track like Dean went out and drove a bunch of fast cars out in Vegas and he was just like a posted until he goes was shown how fucking cool was and it's like the next time that that time I went out there I took my lovely wife with me so we were doing you know couples shit I was gonna be like hey thanks for coming to Vegas I'm gonna go drive some fast cars they have a CVS that's all lit up the Vegas style you should check that out howdy you know like where the fuck would that get me but uh that was a good trip for us too by the way a good family Vegas trip yeah it's a good thing to do as a married person to just sort of like my mother-in-law watched our kid and we came out there and it's fun it's hilarious that's nice like there yes and we know but we immediately go right back to like me my wife I've like ridiculous chemistry laughs and like just totally on the same wavelength and it just fucking resets and I'm learning now like you got it just with the day-to-day and deal and you know but you guys do date nights do you do a lot of date nights yeah probably not enough it's like everything do you work out yeah not enough to eat well yeah not enough and then your relationship becomes like the same way and I've I finally gotten out of my stupid fucking you know died on every he'll fucking argue everything you know I'm getting out of that and I'm starting to understand you know how to how to do it the you not in competition with your wife that's what you got to understand yeah yeah but then there's also that she's also humans everything she says isn't right you just have to pick yeah you got a pic cuz I'm not gonna be that guy where's your happy wife happy life all those guys are get done I watch whatever TV she wants to watch I'm envious of them are you those because they have the smoothest fucking life never lose their house they just like to stay like a fucking you know as big doorman buildings where I got a package for you mister like you become that in the relationship you should just say we're like the Bell cap and something like that yes those lifer doors yeah yeah they're like in a union neutered yeah I'm not saying there's anything wrong with being a doorman before everybody in a fucking uniform gives me shit yeah they're like you become like that in the thing but no we came back and last night you know before we went to bed my wife was like glowing she was like I had the best time and we barely did anything we just fucking hung out laughing you know appreciate that a lot more ones in kids because you realize like this is a rare moment this is hard to do it's hard to get away yeah I mean yeah it's hard to connect while someone's going I wore popsicle I wanna read popsicles yeah well with my kids they're older so they they fight with each other that's mine let me you can even use it it's mine yeah no you can't you yeah and everything is just you know they're separated by two years - so the little one is fierce cuz she always feels like she's getting the short end of the stick from the older one right so she fucking she stands her ground she draws a line in the sand and you know she's ready to throw now it's awesome she doesn't know how to apply it yet but that's gonna serve her well she's not taking any shit I'll tell you that but she's a super sweetheart my daughter's at that age you know where I used to joke bit my act that like I always loved toddlers because they're like these little drunk people like they have no social graces you like literally in the middle of a conversation they come start talking real loud you can't understand them yeah that's that's kind of where we're at but uh you know in like the best way ever that is one of the one of the advantages of being an older debt is everybody who fucked up being a dad you know that look on their face like that goes by so fast man I'm telling you cherish every fucking they sit there like the ghost of Christmas past yeah scaring the shit out of you in a good way I guess the cool thing when they get older is you do stuff with them you take them places and like go on vacations together and hang out with them all day long 24 hours a day multiple days in a row like we every summer and we go to somewhere in Europe or somewhere with the Thailand last year Thailand and we did too I'm too intimidated to go there Thailand yeah it's amazing people are so nice yeah it's so nice it's hot it's fucking they got weird bugs and my little one got lit up by bugs man like she she had a virgin too something that bit her and her whole hand was swollen it was a real freak out moment that fuck we're in Thailand and something's medically going wrong here Wow there's also weird - it's like their culture is very odd doing that had a happy ending yeah yeah it did say yeah we cuz we're at a resort to be a place of emotion yeah so toothpaste the other day no we got some medicine and they applied a topical medicine to it and actually went down within you know by the next day was okay but it was an issue yeah they're sorry well Thailand's hot you know it's muggy and rode elephants we did the whole thing hang out hung out in the jungle was wild what sounds oh yeah yeah I'm ever seeing that yeah yeah yeah yeah elephants are cool man they're weird it's a weird little relationship you have these animals they're so gentle like as long as they know that you are a kind person and you're taking care of them you walk because like the people that run this at they've run an elephant rescue thing it's really kind of know about that that I'm the kind person know what an elephant is just like you know what I don't really feel like yanking these logs up and down this fucking hill I don't understand why I'm doing this ship this guy seems pretty cool no not like that you don't do anything with them other than feed them and you get to ride them but like and people are a little bummed out about riding them and I'm like I don't really recommend riding them look my family wanted to ride them and you know a lot of these people ride but the whole thing is a rescue thing they take these animals that are in circuses and all these different sort of mistreated animals and they take care of them and they let them live in a wild environment they roam free they just feed them so that elephants stay by but they go they go off on their own too and then they come back but they have these big piles of sugarcane and so they're eating the sugarcane they're eating they'll just stop while you while you're walking with them and they just rip a fucking tree out of its roots to start eating it you realize how goddamn strong they aren't they are fucking preposterous least wrong I wish I I wish that we viewed them more as like roommates yeah than like ours so we we did be de plan it up a little smarter yeah I guess I shut my phone up I could show you I found this picture on Instagram of this tiger and the fucking thing is what looked like its legs but it looks like it's doing dips the list of fucking muscles it doesn't even look real like like like that thing exists on this planet and was just like was just walking around free that you could just bump into it I understand you know like when people first came out here and they eradicated that's along the lines of it I mean look at that fuck how many pull-ups Joe do you need to do to fuck it look like that fuck oh my God look at the fucking muscles you must have seen that one do you ever see that one where they were fucking with that tiger in that dude was on the elephant yeah and this thing took off like Jordan in the dunking contest just and every time he did I reached its apex it kept going up like fucking Zion there on Duke yeah and it barely grazed the guy's arm when it clawed him toward park you know yeah the guy like he had nerve damage and his fucking arm didn't work oh yeah for sure yeah I mean there's a great video recent video like two weeks ago of these guys on a motorcycle in India and they're riding horses chasing them and the tiger almost get some it's full clip chasing I actually looked how fast they can run and I'm surprised because the guy wasn't like a scooter or something they can go like 40 miles an hour I think what fucked him up was the surface that he started out riding on right if he was more in his element they get money like a dog in a kitchen gets a little fucking the tiger didn't slide yeah a little bit yeah on the concrete right yeah yeah well maybe just the sound of the engine was just like that doesn't sound tasty well it's one of the we're rare places on earth where Tigers hunt people there's there's a history of them hunting people they hunt or they come upon another ally they hunt them there's an area called the Sunderbans and the Sunderbans Tigers over the last 200 years have killed more than 300 thousand people there they actively you know people believe it or not it's a quick death oh yeah I already know what I would ever do if I ever came in contact with the tiger just do this that's exactly what I would give them the neck and make some defensive move like our offensive moves just to get it go right towards it oh there's no sector yo you UFC guys are all like I would rather get fucking choked out then knocked out it's the same thing you just go to sleep yeah you just sleep I mean it probably hurts for a second and then it's over Oh hurts for a second then as you start to go I think the last thing that's as bad is the smell of the tiger all the breath the breath big day me rotten meat breath oh just affect oh they don't really bathe do I swim don't they okay yeah I can swim fast this is how fast you smell amazing did you see those two poor women who they were gonna take a fucking hike through the rain forest and decided to go themselves gone what happened they found their clothes where was this which rainforest I I don't know so that was right in your app right up your fucking alley isn't - I was surprised it wasn't on your Instagram like that's that's like that's a Rogen shit right there that's a bummer man people get confused and they don't understand you you're a moving thing and you don't move quick and they're they're all about eating moving things if you're moving they're trying to eat you if you if you're by yourself they're gonna eat well it's amazing that wherever we started on this planet that our brain was able to cover for the fact of how fucking slow we are we're slower than squirrels like everything everything is like think fast out there except sloths sloths I know but they like in that but that's their job to get eaten yeah yeah like jalapeno poppers you might bullshit that you just order you want to go say fuck it let's get that slop yeah yeah this is what you go after the real thing you try to eat one of my favorite videos was watching harpy eagles kill sloths they swoop in and snatch them they're like the largest Eagles in South America you get a zipline tour in Costa Rica yeah and the guy knew how to make the noise of the this this fucking ridiculous wingspan bird that doesn't really exist in that area anymore but they're just in their DNA for them to freak out because it's three toed sloth and he imitated it and the fucking thing just just kind of looked around a little bit it's like dude you just gave that thing a mini fucking heart attack we did a zipline that was one mile you get on it you you zip across for one mile as I'm sliding on this thing with my family by the way I'm thinking one last thing they check this who's checking this was a great thoughts the fucking ladder was rusted and then lat ratchet bolted so they had like straps were they ratcheted where the ladder had rusted and then they just grabbed a hold of strap and like clamped down on it and fucking tree and we're climbing up this and it's like a little watch out there that parts rusted through like what that's rusted through and then you get to the top and they latch you up to this thing and I'm telling you you're above the rain forest and it's just yeah and you go for like fucking ten minutes just how high those two we were we were just in the bullshit we were just in the very tippity-top up we've been Costa Rica so we weren't like in the shit and I just remember like the thing where we were doing you know the little I guess platform that you went up to was so fucking high off the ground and it was a third up to tree yeah like when we were looking up at the three-toed sloth that was over there it was like another four five hundred feet it seemed it was ridiculous fucking ridiculous you know nature man nature man there's a fucking great story recently of a guy he's a musician and he was recording sounds of nature and he I'll sleep and a bear ate him so it's recording of him getting eaten while he's recording sounds of danger bears seem like it's a long death oh yeah they just eat you they just hold you down like a salmon and start chewing chunks oh oh yeah they do yeah that cuz they're omnivores omnivores of the worst thing to get killed by you better off getting killed by a predator because predators generally just want to kill you and kill you as quick as they can but bears first of all there are no predators other than other bears and humans with rifles and if they're a place where there's no humans with rifles to the top of the food chain so they just put a paw down on you so they hold you in place and you start chewing chunks of you just eating chunks of you off the video the grizzly my special midnight on Netflix you know my brother called me up one time I I called him after he had watched some video and it was one of those Komodo dragons and it somehow grabbed like a deer looking thing whatever the fuck is in its world that's like that and it I'm sorry people but it snapped its fuckin leg and he said the thing was laying there and it couldn't move and it would just started eating the things guts and the deers sound of I don't watch any of that I don't want execution videos I don't want that on my harddrive mmm I'm gonna bomb tonight watching that how do you find it that quick Jesus Christ this guy's good he's got him saved yeah there's a great one of a komodo dragon eating a monkey and it's got like look at it might be a baboon it's a baboons are no joke I never knew when they fucking yawn you like oh shit that's like a tiger monkey it's like a dog monkey that's what it's like I got to those Fang whoa crazy wolf monkey yeah they kids somebody's got a new band name that wolf monkey monkey that's a good there's a great video of this komodo dragon he's got this monkey's feet and tail hanging out of his mouth he's doing just slowly choking this thing down eating this entire monkey whole loot and the tail and a little feet are pokin out as I talk see if you can find that show the bill no I don't want to I thought I see don't want to I put it on that one so I don't I don't want you can you do that while I talk about my new special feeling up tiger speaking of animals why'd you come up with my paper tiger because I just think we're in a hilarious time cuz you already took strange time I have to stop say like I like the amount of times I had to stop saying it's a weird times it's trance it's the name of Joe special because it just is like what we're focusing on like oh my god can you fucking believe this while this real like half the shit that's going on if it's true it's like you could make a Will Smith or a Tom Cruise movie on those end of the world movies where they except you know it's not gonna have a happy ending and it's just like it just kind of strikes me I don't know and it was also I just I wanted people to watch it and have fun like I'm not trying to fucking hurt anybody it's not malicious but I'm doing my job I'm talking about what's in the news and I'm fucking around and it sparked that and then the other part it's just me talking about my flaws my temper and trying to work that shit out that's all this fucking thing is and for some reason not just saying stand up just a lot of shit that is not as far as like if you had priorities you know like if your house just burnt down you're not being like god we have to get a new toaster you know it's like now we need shelter like that wisdom number one thing but there's all this shit that's like you know a line of importance like line 42 is is getting gassed up to likes number seven or number eight or something like that and I already know people are gonna be like you know typical white male cuz you can't like all of that shit you know there's just something funny about how overtly I don't know I guess reversed like it's like you're doing the same fucking thing and you don't even realize you're doing it as you're saying like a lot some groups of people not all of them like I've been joking how like a lot of feminists are like smart but it's not the ones that are on TV it's like sports fans a lot of sports fans are really smart but not the ones that call in sports talk radio that's perfect you know what I mean yes it's like when we when we would do the Opie and Anthony show okay like Howard Stern like when he would do back in the day when he would do live remotes I love Howard Stern I love Opie and Anthony but like if I was a fan of this show I don't have time and I'm not going to some fucking mall in the middle of the day blowing off work or whatever there because I'm trying to get my own shit go the people that show up you love them because they're diehards but they're out of their fucking minds so it just has to do with that I'm kind of it doesn't necessarily have to do with me but it does it's one of one of those things and it's also another way of saying that I'm full of shit and you're a paper tiger yeah exactly exactly so the Opie and Anthony days you remember we used to have stadium seating like small stadiums heating in the studio and guys would come in us today to let fans come in the studio yeah and sit and watch the show those are the good old days yeah iced it every time I go to New York I add this like it's like a void somebody said perfectly like you know phantom limb you know yeah that's what it feels like and I get XM in New York and I'm gonna doesn't exist that was the last show that I used to get up early for only and when they were together before Anthony got kicked out and yeah then Opie and Jimmy and Anthony were all together it was amazing that was always like seeing a band with all the original members on the first fucking couple of albums tour before David Lee goes solo and then you know well they were the first guys I poured it over to XM to write mm-hmm they were the first or I think they were they before Howard or around the same time but they were they would say I think my name is they were on act that was the one who was XM and then serious before like Howard was on series they were on XM and then they merged yeah but they were the first show the first radio show that let you just fuck around like Howard is amazing right greatest personality of all time by far but Howard controlled the show he had you on he had the board in front of him he controlled the board he asked her questions he had an agenda and you know he was trying to make the show as entertaining as possible and they got ready yeah oh and then he just fucking come on in guys come on in Patrice come on a bill Ari Shaffir have a seat and everybody you'd be in the room breakage your vase ten fucking people in the room Norton Norton would be doing fucking creepy characters I mean it was the it was it was the birth Japanese Jimmy was my favorite one that's like a deep cut Jim Norton Jack talk Jimmy was one of my favorite ones yeah it was so silly which is my favorite thing ever highly intelligent people being silly yeah he's one of my favorite things ever and I gem was the Patrice were sort of the king of that oh yeah super super super next-level smart and just silly really silly I said when Howard went from terrestrial radio to serious it was like he died because I didn't have until I got serious in my car so it's like my favorite thing about my car because I listen to them every fucking morning if I you know I gotta get them up and it's like the old days like when I first came to New York and I get to listen to it David Berthe podcast whether they realize it or not they were the birth of podcasts because ona was like a podcast like this podcast like we didn't even talk about what we're gonna talk about right not no fucking discussion whatsoever I mean obviously you and I don't have to do that but we wouldn't anyway we just come in here and shoot the shit that's all they ever did come on in shoot the shit what the fuck's going on you know Anthony I'd have a gun on him look deep cut Anthony character was the guy with giantism did you ever hear him do that guy no ah no I can't do it you know the giantism and they get that voice you know by the time I was a I would not be tall I know he's going they're dragging and then like something like that would happen and then it just felt like 2:00 in the afternoon somehow and you look at your watch it was like fucking 702 in the morning do you remember when Anthony did live from the compound he did a he built a studio in his basement that's when I was like Owen this is not gonna last this guy's literally building it's just like it's like we're in business selling ice cream and I'm building my own ice cream parlor at home no job I'm in this business with you I knew like like this I'm gonna fall apart you know what's funny is what did that showing is also what made it great yeah like you know they used to play the ocean they used to play this sorry about that they used to play the the Clint Eastwood yeah thing I always thought the theme to that show should have been the wheels on the bus go around and because it was just like yeah and your thing was you were on the bus but you were outside it you are Hank it was you almost like I always felt like when I went in there that Raiders of the Lost Ark you know when Harrison Ford's on the hood and you're grabbing onto the foot of it and some days you hung on and then other days yeah except it didn't have the happy ending didn't have the whip to hang on to what you just fucking do you know were the day we were there and Pat from Moonachie threw up in UK delphi's down that was your idea yeah and then that dude fan Nathanael came he was the one that coined it the baby I got credit for some reasons I think Dan's voice sounded like me he came he came oh I've been saying it's you know your idea was your idea you were like the only thing they could top this for those who didn't see it there's such a brilliant idea it was the eggnog drinking contest and you had to do a double shot like it was bourbon but it was eggnog like every 30 seconds well Pat a returning champion was Pat from Moonachie who had diabetes and lost a toe to it already it was just sitting there and then he continued to drink it oh yeah to do the bit that you came up with I think there has to be like a you know when like a broadcaster can get into the Sports Hall of Fame just because you know you never play the game but he like you know because of what he added to it I always thought that Pat Moonachie should have been like they should have been like like like a chick hearn Johnny most sort of award that he fuckin can't with his his health continued to drink I remember when people posted that video everyone was saying fake this isn't real that made me enjoy it real is like no that was real I was there those plastic bags all over the ground remember they they they put plastic everywhere all over the ground because they knew the people gonna throw up they had the garbage can ready and then Pat Duffy leans his head over the edge of the garbage can and then pad from Moonachie just here come you see him and then it keeps coming it keeps coming it's like way crazier it was a standby you just yes fucking came out and make somebody kept shutting it off and every time I mean it was like it is there I can't watch this you know I still can't tell the story if I tell it in detail I start gagging I'll see fear factor killed all that in me I never know I'll tell the one that makes me gag I start to gag is when there was the dude it was tremendous do you I say I'll say it real quick okay guys you're teared up haha there was a dude who got knocked out so then what he did was he started he puked into a pitcher he puked into a pitcher and then he was drinking his own puke trying to make the other people puke so then somebody dared this guy who had to take a swig from it and he had like this hipster Viking level beard I can't do it this is like fucking 10 years later he took this Viking level swig he just so he gave himself like kind of like a facial with it and then he puked into the picture I think and I remember it was in his beard there's a point in that podcast and in that puck and in that show where I almost puke yeah doesn't crazy thing about seeing everybody's my people Bill's gonna go Bilson I was like hanging on to the fucking table yeah we didn't realize that the time those are some of the greatest moments of our life you know I got to figure forgive yourself that because you were in the moment oh yeah I was feeling like melancholy when I was in Vegas you know and I had you know I had this rout sitting in my room smoking cigar with Bobby Kelly Rick Thalia you know from Boston scene right and we were sitting then I was looking down at the strip before they came over and I was thinking about the first time I came out there was right right before they imploded the sands or the dunes or something they were starting to implode those old ones and just walking up and down the strip in the real was the new hot one casino and just all the great fucking times that I in crazy fucking stories and all that and then just walking around Vegas being old now and seeing all these young people like and you want to stop them and just be like dude if you could this any way to take this in do it because you know at my age if I was to continue doing that you're just a creep I really respect younger people where it's just like this is their time let them have it that's their club yeah don't be standing in there with your white whiskers and shit listen trying to listen to their DJ music just get the fuck let them enjoy their generations drugs and let them have their fucking stories and just yeah yeah there's no way you could impart that on anyone though tell them to soak it up and enjoy it I had moments or I remember thinking when I was young like wow this is a wild moment well I remember you that night after the the baby bird we were at Caroline's you are Caroline's and I went down there and you had this debt that fucking grin in your face you like really that's great radio I was just like and I remember I told that I told the whole fucking story I came home me it just started living with me and her friend was there and I was telling the story of what I saw that day and I was laying on the ground crying laughing telling and then this guy did this do you guy who was fucking he would do his shot and when anybody would puke he would stand over in the corner and not face them he was face in the corner so we started calling him Blair which everybody got this so I'm crying laughing and then gagging as I'm telling the story and then they weren't laughing which made it even funnier to me and then I just remember a friend at one point just was like she was like where do they find these people and then that was that just sent me over the top I was like I don't know just crying laughing but god bless him yeah where did they find these people well that was a thing of like shock radio shock radio gets such a derogatory it's got such a derogatory connotation you know shock jocks shock radio oh great shock radio when you're a young guy and you're a part of that and you're there in the moment it's one of the greatest moments of your life yeah it's so is you're not shocked if there's thought behind it shock is just like oh what happened fuck those people that's just basic yeah bullshit like I remember when I was coming up you know and you would just torn through the Boston scene and then you you got on some show it wasn't it wasn't news raid it was something else hardball yeah and you were coming to the Kowloon it's the first time I was gonna see you do a set and all these guys and always be so dirty so dirty blah blah blah blah blah and I watched your set and it's like this guy isn't dirty there's like thought behind this like anybody can do like a handjob joke but your joke was like you said you ever a woman give you a handjob it's like brushing your teeth with your left hand I'm like that's a fucking killer joke it just happens to be about a handjob and some people can't separate that yeah well that was that bad that was back in the day where there was still a bunch of guys that were left over from the days where Stephen Wright made it by being on The Tonight Show and there was this weird feeling to the air you know when they talk about in stand when stand-up stood out France Alamitos documentary which is an amazing documentary yeah I loved that but those guys before that were just wild they were just comics they were doing blood they were getting in fights they were chaotic and then Stephen Wright got The Tonight Show and became a fucking superstar I mean a gigantic national superstar and everybody else was like hey what the fuck what about me and I came along after that and there was this remnant of that there remember remember Chris Zito yeah Chris Eidos giving me advice when I was an open mic er he was like you can't swear if you swear you're never gonna get on TVs tell me all this shit and it's like in his eyes he was doing me a service right is that was in his I'm a good place he came from a good place in his eyes but I was like fuck he's gonna make me quit cuz like this is what I want to do I'm like oh I grew up watching Dice Clay and Sam Kinison he goes well you're not Dice Clay I'm like okay it's like well neither were they till there but it was bad advice from a guy who had made it right he hadn't made it but he was at least he was a professional and I was as far from making it as humanly possible I was an open mic ER I remember I went off stage one night and he goes Joe fucking Rogan ladies and gentlemans Joe fucking Rogan didn't say fuck enough like in his eyes he was like look I'm just telling you this because I care like you're fucking up your career alright so I had it in my head I was like well I'm not gonna do this then in my head I was like I'm not I don't want to be that guy did you ever notice I'm not that guy that wasn't me I wanted I liked talking about shit that made my friends laugh when we were all sitting around drinking right that's what was that's why I was in it I was in it to talk about wild shit right it didn't mean that you couldn't be clever and talk about wild shit but I'd never fit in anywhere in my life so the idea of me fitting in like on television that's almost like too weird from like an offensive that there was like 9,000 stand-up shows on TV that you could get on and you could become it wasn't just the Tonight Show because The Tonight Show which was the the biggest thing yeah but then there was the comedy on the road it was evening at the improv comedy half-hour come there was all of this shit and so that's what they were guiding towards and then I had the tail end of that and then weird you started 90 92 92 so when I came it was a tail end of the at work clean and then it was you know talk about your family so they can build the show around you so you can do a sitcom and I might be thinking like I don't want to do a sitcom I can't say that everybody had this idea in their head that there was only one way to do it the beautiful thing about all that shit imploding is that there's none of that now now comedy is comedy and when you see kids coming up now you know you go to see the guys at the store that I like doorman and open mic errs and I say guys girls to alley makovski I take her on the road me all the time and she's 23 you know she's just getting it together now she's in that stage now she's like five years in they just want to do comedy man these kids just want to do comedy well there's people now who cause comedy is doing so well stand-up there's people who like weren't comedians made it as something else and now are thinking about doing stand-up right yeah you guys how lucky we are that we're doing it now that's what I would think I said it's it to my wife when I was in Vegas is like you believe I get to do this I love and I'm gonna hang and fucking as long as I'm doing it I still love it I love it as much now as ever maybe more now than ever I mean I don't have to do it I do I do I would do five six shows a fucking week in town and I love it no that's why you're great because I always felt the guys that that never stopped going to the club it's that if look if you continue to tour and you become like a draw you don't have to go to the clubs in LA but you pay a price you pay a price for that because those kids coming up you're getting something from them too much to say watching you going oh wow you know you're that guy that I saw and and you know now I'm doing a show with you and it's just like kid you're keeping me young because like just being around them you stay current yes and it's white like why Damai rare akil's just as hard in 2019 as he did in 2009 99 89 is because that fucking guy never stopped going to the gym yes and stays in there so I get something out of going to see I get you know something on a watch and Dom out of watching you and then and some new kid coming up and just being in all of that yeah keeps you like current cuz if you don't you start getting like a must there's a like a fucking you know that old person died in smell stunting stop laughing on your act yeah if you're only doing it to your crowd to I think there's a problem there to the one of the beautiful things about the store is there's fifteen guys on the show that night they're there to see everybody they they look at the lineup like oh shit Bilborough shit Chris D'Elia Oh Nikki Glaser's on they they see all these great comics to me I do too Christa Lee is like like from the get-go like I could see like you know it remind me like of a Boston guy where just like it's like this guy's a legit headliner just trying to kill just trying to kill that's all he's do know and then his concept of killing I thought was Boston level oh yeah for sure well it's these you know and particularly because he's always at that right there that right there is the last match no but that right there is how I live my life imagine that the hardest fucking way to do something why do you do that I do a lot of things that way but not when it's ineffective I mean that's one of the reasons why I bowhunt well that's where we're deep yeah see I like that like I I feel if I was gonna go out and go kill something cute and fuzzy if I fuckin had a uh you know total hypocrite cause I am a mediator anyways if I used a bow and arrow we would feel like an accomplishment i watch Ted Nugent kill a bear which I could never do you know when there's all these fucking places to just get a chicken sandwich like do I really need to make a fuckin you know a bear double cheeseburger do you want to try some bear sausage in the freezer back there would you try it if I gave it to you no really no cuz I went to the zoo one time and I saw this bear and it was funny because it was sittin half in the water and half out and had its arms that's arms its front legs fuckin like it look like it was sitting in a Jacuzzi like a lounge and we pulled up on the bus to look at it it was just the way it looked I kind of locked I met eyes with the thing and I knew always thinking put like the video you know they're killing the deer in the back well it's eating it alive and the deer screaming cuz you need to know what a bear really is when you see bears in real life you go oh that's what that thing it's a fucking killing bear would just punch it in the head to stop hearing to do this see that look at that thing no you're gonna buy the neck just no it's taking chunks out of it bro believes the reason why that thing's screaming this is cuz it's biting its back okay that's enough that's what sounds like me trying to touch my toes every morning you know it's hilarious you know my daughter does one which she likes to stretch with me she thinks it's funny and she makes those noises cuz she said she's supposed to so she goes seek money she goes so cuz I wanna stretch add that and then she goes uh-oh like I have like a foam roller and I'll she'll come walk in a room and she'll look at me she'll smile and just funny she sits on it cuz she doesn't know how to use it she sits down she just goes oh my wife laughs at me that's he's imitating how old you are my kids are allowed to hit me as hard as they can we teach them you know they've taken martial arts classes but I teach them and one of the things I do is I have them lazy advice in that hair because my I want my daughter to know how to defend her jujitsu yeah I'll give you I'll get you a good school near you but I let my kids leg kick me full blast just full blast I show them how to do it where the shin slams I know I let him fucking slam into me well I've men do it I mean I've been kicked by a lot you know but there's an attrition to that no your father's right you're 20 19 on the inside he's got legs I let them I let them slam their shit fucking hurts man but I'm letting them know like if anybody ever fucks you there's somebody who fucks you over some kid wants to get into a fight some girls picking on you slam one of these bitches right into her fucking thigh like it hurts me debate over yeah teach them how to like defend themselves it's it's also important that they understand what it feels like to be in conflict with someone like when I roll them in martial arts classes when they were young like my one daughter was four there the one was six when I first started doing it and it's cool to watch them grapple and do these things I'm like this is what's good is like you know what it's like to struggle with someone this is not an alien thing for you to struggle with a person when I watched my youngest daughter grapple with this boy and triple them and slam them onto the ground and get on his knee and then the instructors like good job try again they're doing it again like you know what it's like memory yeah well otherwise it's a song for you yeah your mind doesn't know what happens when someone's trying to do something to you whereas have you've done it it's not alien I mean it's not like you should do it you definitely shouldn't do it to someone if they don't want to do it to you but if someone's if someone senses that you're scared of conflict it's one of the surest signs you're gonna get fucked with and that was me a lot of no I explained that to me a lot of my life can end I've had both you know I went from being a kid who was terrified of conflict to being a martial arts champion the reason why I became a martial arts champion cuz I was being picked on all the time right kids were always fuckin with me I was like I don't like this okay so I'm going to become what I'm terrified of oh I should have done that I was just like well school ends at 3:00 realistically only do this for another two hours and 45 minutes I went the other way you said to teach you they and they would have the two people you know it would Eddie right way you know Mikey bad way we should do that do a little will make a kids book have me let young me with a fucking orange afro there's only two hours and 45 minutes not knowing that knowing 245 minutes all the authority is gonna be gone right opens everything now about with mixed martial arts going mainstream okay and there's no ref to get in there at the video at all yes that's what is scary and then everybody like like I think with young kids it's like oh I want to be the guy going oh you know that that's who they want to be no one wants to be the ref to jump in and say stop they want to yell out worldstar worldstar they want to do that and they all want to have it and then post it and get it to have some hits like that's like you know I mean I'm not shitting on it because that's what I would be doing if I was young I got a video pulled off of Facebook and Instagram and I got a community strike Community Guidelines strike because it was violence against minors but it was a kid who was picking on another kid he wouldn't stop fucking with this kid and then finally the kid just pushed him away and then put up a stance like he's ready to fight and the kid came out of him he kicked him grabbed him slammed him on the ground and got him in an armbar and you know oh I saw that yeah that was great it was a fucking amazing video and the kid didn't even get hurt but it was a lesson I mean this is why it's good to learn martial arts yeah as this kid was a cunt and he was fucking with this kid and the kid knew how to fight right so I put it up there like look this is this is the benefits of learning a martial yeah and then those people who who their hearts in the right places don't post that because that's gonna make kids fight other kids no that's that's you're not going to like through words and hashtags stop having kids be kids be kids and it's it's gonna happen and yeah yeah I mean the idea that you're gonna protect kids from reality by that it's just so it's just so silly you're not you're not gonna stop people from doing things to people you gotta understand what is happening when people do those things and how you can learn how to fight so you can mitigate most of it not and that best part is other kids see you do that and then you become the kid oh no fuck what that kids actually yeah it'll dislocate your elbow yeah so you want to be yeah I want to be the nice kid who can fight so everybody leaves you alone you know I went through the entire eight that should be written somewhere yeah be the nice kid that knows how to fight there's a lot of those kids now there's so many more it's getting in a fight in school today with someone you don't know it's a risky proposition there's so many kids and no jiu-jitsu so many kids that take more time everything is on another level you sure these fucking kids coming up playing drums oh yeah just the shit that they can do is it's fucking and bananas really nobody could do this kids doing shit that's beyond as far as independence okay what they're doing is beyond what I saw a lot of guys when I would like when I first started buying VHS tapes drum instructional videos now they don't have this seasoned they don't let necessarily have the feel and all of that and know how to apply it necessarily in a musical sense with the because that just comes with experience but what they have in their fucking Arsenal for chops is fucking insane cuz of YouTube you think yeah because you're jamming with the world now right so it becomes oh oh I'm gonna try that and I'm gonna incorporate you know now the people who do it the most basic level me is I just see what somebody does and I try to learn how to do it and I've only now since doing comedy going like oh I'm like a joke thief except I just took that guy's groove that he just came up with it's you're supposed to be inspired by it to turn it into something else or work on something else that you're doing that's like another level that you know eventually you get to I think as a musician you do as far as me watching them not as a musician but like just seeing what these kids can physically fucking do it's in guitar plays the bass players that I saw there's that one who went viral there was that this little girl from like Japan played good times bad times like it was nothing and Robert Plant is watching it like going this yet and he's you something she's like she's falling off a log which meant like it was nothing it was nothing to her I've been trying to play those fucking triplets my whole life and I still don't have it down I'm just like fuck what is it about is it just kids learn quicker because they don't have as much shit in their head well back in the day when you heard something first of all you hit cassette tapes there to keep fucking rewinding it and you're at the mercy of your own bedroom like there's nobody in there okay and now and then when you had the record you could maybe slow it down okay but even then you had you know you're slowing it down there's still the basement trying to get everything in it it's hard to fucking hear nowadays somebody who's a fucking expert or whatever are so-called expert cuz you know the guys who actually play goes you know there's a lot of people teaching don't know what the fuck they're doing like the Thermage shit the show they'll break the whole this thing yeah this her yeah and her little cute fucking like she's adorable sock some of those fucking trip what she's doing it's like it's nothing Fox look at her get looted baguette later face oh my god said door oh no she's she's killing it that's the thing too is she actually she's not just doing what John did she's play she's playing it is she playing to Led Zeppelin's oh he came yeah I was that way okay can't play they're actually smiling like we have a good that's look I had a face when somebody gave me an ice cream how old one think she is 7/8 Wow look at that she's a killer I think it's awesome that you're into music it's another thing like and I was thinking that too when you were taking me up in the helicopter ride like you do these other things and you get really into them I'll tell you what's crazy right now I'm going for my instrument rating that's to basically fly in like like if you come into a city and like the whole city's covered with clouds and you can't fucking see anything how to use your instruments yeah this is this is what separates the men from the boys right so it's something that was really intimidating so finally decided to do it so the guy I'm taking the lessons from I I don't know if I should say is that I still want to blow up people's I never know how much private they want to be so I fucking go in there because something goes alright I know I know the guy I know the guy I know the fucking guy my instructor goes I got the best fucking guy in LA so I go to his house cuz I'm gonna fly on a simulator which is gonna save me a ton of fucking money initially and then eventually so you know what the fuck you supposed to be doing when you start spending a bunch of money what does this emulator look look he's simulus little computer screen he just has like I got airplane yoke and a throttle thing that's all it is but it's getting you to look at like you have a 6-pack of gauges and then you have these other two these these uh the OBS or whatever it's a bunch of shit I don't wanna fucking try to explain here but you're looking at that that becomes your eyes that becomes looking out the window is looking at your fucking gauges and it's unbelievably claustrophobic and fucking terrifying if if you got into that type of weather and you don't know what the fuck you're doing that's how you die okay now so anyways I go over this guy's fucking house he's hey how you doing oh you know I'm so-and-so what's going on I walk into his house he's got a whole music studio and then we're like a fucking Grammy he has this whole other fucking life where he like won a Grammy last year for writing a song and some major fucking superhero movie and he's like a like a prodigy piano player and then we go in the band he knows and he's also he got into flying and just took it to level that he became an instructor and I just sit across from the guy in awe go and all of that is fucking in that in that it's fucking unbelievable i --q outlining like fucking chapter four and the fucking thing but there's all like gauges and shit and i'm little question marks and stuff was like alright I'm gonna figure out how to do this and it's becoming less intimidating but I haven't gone up yet but just as far as like getting back to like these kids because the fact that she's eight and can do that is she hasn't got credit card debt she's not in some fucking relationship date some loser kid who's playing videos all day games all day and she has to come up with her half the rent and she has this whole fucking wonderment and shit is like the kids like they're positive that stuff is possible it's what do you wish you could do that just have nothing but one thing to concentrate on just completely free of all the nonsense of life I'm not wired that way it's weird my I think that's why I like I'm not into speed when driving I like to do it every once in a while but like I like cruising along because it relaxes me yeah it kind of shuts down the fucking thunder and lightning of like let's do this let's do this for ten minutes and I'll do this for fucking six minutes above oh and all that shit so yeah I driving like the right lane well you and I you and I are very similar in that way that we have a bunch of other shit that we do you get into shit like heavily heavily into something else yeah if I get into I get into it does hurt me a little bit because I'm starting to find like I don't know what's going on in the world which is scary as a comic so I got a dip back in but it's healthier though well but my wife but you also have to know what's going on you kind of got to know who's current and music yeah like I learned that when I tried I needed a reference for a pop star and I did it at a college in like like four or five years ago or whatever in the last time I did a fucking college gig and I used Britney Spears as a reference and they're all look like it just died and I was like oh wait a minute she's like mid-30s divorced mother of two but in my world she was still 19 yeah we were looking at Instagram numbers whose it was the the the Selena Gomez or her and Ariana Grande are up but I see on renautas the rubber right but singers oh yeah yeah like 190,000 million fuckin Instagram I mean she's got 160 or some 30 and 150 or something fucking insane handling that in her twenties oh how do you not be crazy and good luck when you're older you know the Justin Bieber had a post the other day on his Instagram talking about all the drugs that he did when he was younger and how much it fucked him up and now he's got a relationship with the Lord and he's got you know he's married and he's trying to be a normal person yeah then he's struggling with the fact that he was insanely famous when he was a kid yeah that's not that's not something I would you know I like seeing people become successful but that's not something I would I would wish on somebody no it's not the Domus wish like he made it now yes but even then he's still a kid he's like yes 24:25 better now then making it at six you know when you're a little kid and you become famous like and you're the one calling the shots you realize all these people are you're responsible for their income yeah mine's still developing and you have everybody saying yes around you yeah his brain is still developing now is your frontal lobe isn't even fully formed with your 25 he's I was gonna say that but I didn't know that he's a baby he's a fucking young boy but he's you know trying to figure it out you know he's already I mean they were roasting him on common sense four years ago that's crazy and he already had like 900 million dollars in the bank yeah it's that accomplished enough by like 22 to get roasted yeah I mean most people get roasted they're like fucking my age Alec Baldwin they don't they just do yeah yeah yeah I love that guy big fan his I don't know him do you know him or you know I know I was on a flight one time and he was sitting next to me realize like I'm not gonna talk to him we're not gonna bug him and then he just leaned over with that matinee idol voice he's like do you fly often and when I found with him was if you just talked about anything other than him you know him being him he would totally talk but the second I ever veered it towards what he did he just didn't have any interest in talk I was like I get it let's let's so the time I did talk I just would talk about you know anything but that well have you ever sat next to someone I was like hey how do you come up with your material yeah it's fucking bread I thank you this is how I come up with it yeah what was that one guy where you go and bill was that one story Oh God oh that guy that poor guy he was on something he got all paranoid he had some sort of military background he's gonna say yeah all plain his how this idea that you were a bad guy that was a hilarious story though yeah he had the idea that I was acting fidgety and nervous because he was fijian nervous no I'm also a fucking lunatic I was probably fucking thinking of 50 things at the same time as probably was acting that way but he took it to the whole in love yeah he stopped the plane Oh God we pulled over cause if you don't fucking you're new today I'm gonna push that button I was like fucking push it oh that's right I forgot that whole story he was a military guy right oh Jesus people that think they have good instincts and their instincts suck are the worst like people think I've just got a good we're reading people like actually you don't yeah well there's two ways to go into something humbly and say I don't know shit and as you learn shit and you think oh and I'm starting oh my god there's all this other stuff I don't know yeah and then there's other people they learn a little bit and then they're this Authority Trump and then you get a couple of drinks at them yeah excel you know a plane has to pull over how did they resolve that I don't remember I don't really remember either was something I'd dwelled on I just remembered the stewardess coming over talking to us like we were children like are you two gonna be okay next to each other and I'm just like I'm fine I don't know what this guy's doing and he continued to Yammer at me till he just passed out and then I think when he when we finally landed he was kind of sober and I think he was starting to feel a little stupid I think we've all been there yeah we've all been there yeah sure he's a nice guy maybe not maybe not ending for the movie I don't think that will test well with the baby went walking through the woods one day all right I'm gonna let you introduce the next topic maybe you got eaten by a bear that's a way to go boy if you got to be eaten by any animal what would it be no the bigger the better sharp over quick uh no not shark I don't like that because I don't like my head being here in the evils under here and it's gonna take a bite out of me first to see if I'm edible oh and you just sitting there you know missing a chunkier leg going please don't let me taste good please don't let me taste good let him just fucking leave it's interesting sharks used to be if you caught a shark people were happy you got that fucking thing out of the water good like when fishermen would bring in a shark people get excited yeah now you're a monster well there's there's this thing that I follow about sharks on Instagram and like it's fucked this person found a tiger shark the 18-footer or some shit right and he she went down that she somehow gain this thing's confident and had like a fish some fishing line and like took it out okay if this can't be real and then somehow she ran into the thing again in the ocean and she was petting it like a fucking lap dog trying to suggest that this thing knew her knew her and was happy and respect it mean the way they cut it together and of course the music always takes you emotionally where they want you to go but I was just watching that whole thing going like it's good that you did that but I don't think you're at the ican now this tiger shark is talked to all the other tiger shot not on out Bill's cool do you remember Beastmaster remember that TV show no there was a dude who's like a jack dude and like big bracelets on and he was mucking commune with the animals and they would like land on his shoulder and shit like Eagles would land on his arm and all the animals would listen to him really stupid show cuz it's he there's no there's nothing humble about that name piece masterpiece master see they're allowing you to live and your name yeah you gotta have been Tarzan hare who was the guy in Beastmaster who was it a TV show now it was a show I think it was a TV show was a TV show that guy like had this special relationship with the fucking with the animals they all listened to him oh yeah I didn't know he had a sword too so it was a big dick to judge him by how long that fucking the man fought this huh hang it down below his knees if you don't have a big dick the line it's not gonna listen to you look that Eagles landed on his arm yeah he this was like the Conan the Barbarian days like after Conan the movie I was a giant hit there was a lot of dudes with their shirts off holding swords holding swords there was a thing tell him lions way to go yeah it was I'll tell you one thing that I would never do in acting is I will never ever III catch I probably shouldn't say this but like working with monkeys aside from you know it's going to be a bad movie no fucking way I worked with the writer who got attacked by a monkey when he was a kid and it was just one of those organ-grinder ones they fucked him up those fucking show business man it's gotta thanks for the organ grinder music and their fat monk and he was talking about like his clarity and understanding of monkeys just by getting attacked by one he goes nah he goes I won't do it he go she do like you're good for about 18 20 minutes and then the monkey just starts fucking acting crazy and then eventually it just gets like you know I've always said that you go to a circle like a circus like a bear doesn't want to ride a bicycle so what did they do to that fucking thing to make it give in yeah and it's a bear so eventually it's gonna become a bear again you know and it something's got like all like those circus all that shit it's just that it's inevitable like what you're doing yeah circus is a dark is that what they do to elephants and monkeys and bears there's a great video it's not a good well it's horrible do you have any happy videos of animals just existing I don't save those I know you're done just I'm chilling out there's a video of a chimp ride the bike and a girl in a bear riding a bike and the chimp tripped up the bear somehow and they crashed and the bear grabs a whole that chimp just rips it apart from everybody what's that fucking yeah here it is so the Bears riding and the chimps riding and they collide and when they collide the bear is fucking furious at the chimp and just starts fucking ragheads like road rage right boom goes down and he tries to help him back get back on the bike is this it is this the one oh he's got the chimp right there oh yeah it's too late I thought they'd have a muzzle on the fucking thing well not this time they trusted him so he just fucks up that chimp and they can't get it away from him that's not even a big bear it's a small bear no dude that's fucking huge would you want to fight that guy in a bar no guy that stocky red hairy coming at you that's Georgie animal steel it's just such a stupid fucking form of entertainment you know let's get animals to do shit that they don't normally do people are freaking out ah I like it took them that long to stand up to realize that's not part of the show something about music you can just take you emotionally where you want them to go ripping them apart like you imagine that that used to be show business you used to be like you know covered wagon you'd pull into town ladies and gentlemen gather around and there was a show and then you know you have a minstrel show and people would sing and do puppets and there'd be a play and you'd yeah that's when when do you think the first guy got up and told jokes and made people laugh like when was our first Oh who's that guy he wrote that he wrote that great book on the history of stand-up and it was a guy like Frank Fay or something like that uh-huh was the first guy that went out there like I don't need to have like a fucking hula hoop and spinning plates and he just went out and was like I'm just gonna tell stories and make him like he kind of did a monologue type of thing but uh he was the first guy if I haven't Rises that I think was the 20s and then in the 40s he was actually on the side of the fascists he was a fascist yeah there was really yeah there was people in this country that you know didn't think what those guys were doing was necessarily wrong which really if you look at the history forget about this country a humanity like there's always been that so what fucked his career if I'm remembering this correctly this could be like fucking hope I'm saying the right guy he so he ended up doing this yes Frank faced and he did this show all right I guess that's earlier when he's doing the props he's come out dressed like he's in the Foreign Legion but he did a show right after World War two right after he won and it was a pro fashion rally in New York City and he was the big name he signed on to do it and the night was called the Friends of Frank fain the first stand-up comic was a fascist house I know I can't say I don't I don't know that but then there's other people that I got a body mind that will argue that that Mark Twain was Samuel Clemens yeah well argue will argue that he was the first stand-up so I don't know really nice I think it just sort of they would sort of poked its head up and then ducked back down like somebody improv the line like hey I did that without my hula hoop you know they got sick a lug and shit around or something I don't know what it was but uh did you ever see Lenny with Dustin Hoffman yeah it's fucking great in that I mean he really came off like a comic you know he seemed like he was Lenny Bruce now he's an incredible incredible acting I actually went down a rabbit hole looking up a bunch of shit about him and oh no it wasn't that I don't even hind went down this rabbit hole the things he's fucking talk about like before 9/11 like what you could do and then still walk around a free man like 18 months later it was crazy like these people on the Upper East Side I don't know what the fuck they were doing this really radicalized time like the 60s early 70s um where around that time these people were making a bomb right yeah and like these rich kids are some shit because it was like a 2 in a townhouse on the Upper East Side and Dustin Hoffman had one on that block close enough to it and you know these fucking idiots blew themselves up blew the fucking building up and fucked with his townhouse and there's a picture of him if you can find it is he grabbed some piece of expensive art that he had bought got it out of his house and it's a picture a young Dustin Hoffman walking up the street yeah this poor guy like had the balls to go after a dream you know you think it's hard making as a comic I don't even know how the fuck he made it as an actor now forget about then yeah look at it blew up their whole fucking thing and he's like I made it I'm on the Upper East Side everything's great and then these fucking the building's missing yes so he owns something close enough to that yeah Jesus Christ it's crazy it's like all the building to the building to the left fine building to the rise fine and that buildings obliterated yeah I'm sure that there was some damage there's other ones so but it's crazy how the one in the middle just missing no but if you look it up like that the the jail time that they got the wall I mean you know obviously the person who was down there the people down there died I think but then there was they figured out who was in cahoots with them but also their parents owned a townhouse on the Upper East Side oh so they place and Jimmy spent a little you know distant your honor you know you know they go to the same fucking party yeah you get away with shit before the Internet they passed around some cash do you ever see a doctor check who shot fuckin Andy Warhol barely did any fucking time and then years later how he died I always thought he died on a deep drugged himself first though just doing drugs a party but I think it was complications from the bullet wound yeah when you when you get like shot like I also think oh yeah Morgan damage well when you get shot in the gut - that's like fucking worse because all that shit that breaks down your food seeps in like the infections and the dish oh yeah it's horrific would not show him for I don't know I don't know I'm not saying he I'm not saying anybody was a great fuckin person here but that's never a solution but the jail time that that person got was ridiculously short and then he's got to live the rest of his life dealing with the fallout of what that person did to him and then also knowing that that crazy chick is out there well isn't a guy who shot Reagan out now no I think they were gonna let him out and he was like no guys no you don't wanna do I think he said that I thought they let him out my memory isn't the greatest I'm probably combining all three of these stories and it's actually about he's out quick-quick he says he's released so what's his name again John Hinckley Hinckley yeah you should look up everything I say actually bill it's completely the other direction do you ever watch a documentary on the Weathermen do you remember the weatherman no with the weatherman we're a radical terrorist group from the 60s like some Ron Burgundy shit okay 6007 that's what that Greenwich bombing has something to do with that there's like a group called like the SDS the students of Democratic Society which was an offshoot of the whether meant I'm gonna just look into their Wikipedia this where they radicalize rich white kids maybe well one of them one of the guys who was one of the Weathermen went on to become a professor at a university in Chicago and that was one of the things that they were talking about when Obama was running for president he's friends with a terrorist because he knew this guy from his from his university days alright because wasn't that like the idea and Fight Club that the Project Mayhem something like that you want to talk about that's the same sort of idea or they just wanted to fuck up all sorts of different things in society and not troll people by bomb shit you know I'm talking about yes we should ask Chuck when he was in here mmm-hmm but the weatherman anyway the documentary is crazy they were they wanted to take down society and they wanted to take down the government so they were doing acid and having orgies and places and blowing things up and there was no like so then we can rebuild it it was just like fuck it up I mean I think there's a lot of anarchists a lot of people in the their youth where they want to just tear the whole fucking thing down you know I was having a conversation with my wife about this really interesting just the other day we're out at dinner and she was like when she was young she had a rough childhood and she was hoping that society would fall apart cuz her life was a mess and other people's lives were great and she had this thing in her head like she hopes society crumbled because then everything would be fucked all over the world no one would be okay because her life wasn't okay I'm like that's really interesting yeah really interesting cuz her insight the way she was talking about it was like because she was remembering that very specifically when she was young you know chaotic that's why that Tarantino movie so so like funny to me I loved it I don't think they ever say hippie without saying fucking fucking hippies well there's always been ample like that right there's always been people who want to take that whole fucking thing down you know I want to know when you can buy that movie and own it like what out cuz back in the day just buy like the DVD cuz that is like like you're going on tour that's like that's going be a Goodfellas movie for me where I'm gonna watch that thing 5,000 times in my life and always see something new in it and then it becomes like like the second time I saw it I realized how great the actor playing I'm trying to talk all this surface yeah don't give any spoiler alerts well this this guy he plays a director that's gonna direct leonardo dicaprio and like what that guy does with that role and how many inside jokes you don't have to be in show business how fucking funny that guy is it's like well you know the 90th time I watch Goodfellas I realized how funny that guy was the guy who had the wigs like yeah how fucking hilarious and how great that guy played that degenerate gambler because it the first time you watch it it's like Joe Pesci and De Niro you've seen all of those guys and then you start to like Frankie Carbone and you know the roast beef guy and all of that shit but then you've just watched and what just looks like everybody is great in this yeah everybody took like ears one or two lines and everybody just like hit a homerun you know what freaked me out in that movie that I couldn't believe the violence against women like the scenes the fight scenes I'd only give anything away but there was some what you like whoa you could still do this in a movie like holy shit that's my favorite quote from Tarantino what I saw an interview one time and they were saying yeah we know it's trying to write movies and stuff you know and they were going like you can't do this you can't do that he's like why maybe because I do another fuck I want it's like that well that's why you movies are great yeah what are you like you just like that's that's the comic I want to watch I can say whatever the fuck I want yeah good I want to see you totally unfiltered yeah that's good I mean there's a time in a place I think you know you know to to be filtered sure you know what I mean there's no sense just going in and showing your ass and being it you know right if somebody hires you for a private gig and they go okay perform between these two lines you're not Lenny Bruce if you go in then you go outside and you're a fucking asshole right because you agreed to do that right you do a corporate gig for a Christian Church right but if you're at like a it's like no you you're a guest yeah you came into a nightclub so right this isn't you know if you don't like it you leave but I came to see you specifically and all the other people did too and the one or two people that'll get upset well you're the problem the other people are there to see this kind of shit it seemed so selfish it'd be like if I went to a restaurant and I didn't like the meal and then the chef owed me an apology and had to change his menu and you didn't want anybody else to eat stop yeah I hate this food and if you go in there and eat off of that menu then you're part of the fucking problem and I'm gonna try to take you down - yeah cuz you didn't have a problem with this fucking chicken and dumplings whatever the fuck making strange time strange best name special I feel yeah well I didn't know what else to call it just that's all I could think of yeah I like it because it's not it's not you're not punching them in the nuts you just said strange it's a weird time yeah paper tiger yep how long do you think you're gonna wait to do another one do you have an idea in your head you gonna try to do two years we try to do a set schedule never think that no because that takes the enjoyment out of it it's like more like I had a bit that I was doing the first time I told the story in my new hour two women like yelled out simultaneously and they yelled the same thing which means they whispered to each other let's yell this in three two one and I got out go fuck yourself I got into that with them and then they went upstairs and I'm like it's a comedy club I know they're still there because comedy club security is the worst it's the worst they just they just they they don't know how to kick people out so I went upstairs I had to put the hoodie up and all of that shit they said they were at the bar I walked by and then I go outside the club took the hoodie up and then they were there and then we got into it again and I was just like you don't even know me go fuck yourselves you know what the fuck I'm saying fuck you fucking with him Anna just my perception on something I was telling a fucking story right so and it had to do with a lesbian so that and then it was the wrong show to do it on cuz I think it was kind of a gay show I mean I went up there they had paper cutouts of dicks all over the place so I'm like i but it's a comedy club so I'm tell I'm telling the story I want to tell so I told the story and you know so it took me a little while you know to kind of imagine I pretty much of me it was like you know I don't want to have that kind of interaction with people so I've just been you know working the bit out working a bit out and then like you know I did the joke the other night at the Laugh Factory and the exact person from that group came up to me told me she loved the joke and she was just like I feel like you would describe in my life and I'm like that's why that's the fun of this shit and you know as people say like oh you're working on a joke I can't do it at home yeah I have to go out there and just start throwing shit against the wall and see how to piece this stuff together so to go back to like when are you gonna do a special again like I enjoy this part too much to rush it we had to be thinking about like you know then you're like okay I'm doing is special I'm taping it here and then I'm in the bubble and then every night I go onstage and it's just like okay and then I gotta do this and maybe what if I open with this and what if I put in and just it just becomes you know this is added weight to it mmm that makes it like you know the opposite reason the entire reason why I got into this business was not that fucking real job I wanted to have fun so this which just goes back to what I was talking about you when I was watching us a flock Joe's on the other side he shot his special and now he's going down and as much as it can be frustrating putting it together he's having fun every night seeing alright where's this idea gonna go yes it's gonna leak cuz this sitting like when I'm putting together a new hour like I have some of the hacky as shit ever and I take all of those rules and throw them out the window I don't give a fuck if you see me doing these jokes and most of them don't live but some of them grow into something better yeah and then it's not hacky and now it's this this thing that then shoots off into this then you just start spinning off over here yeah yeah and then all the say I got like I got like eight minutes I got 12 minutes they're seeds right yeah it's starting to come together so when people go down there and it's literally like it's not even done you're just starting to draw and they're reacting to it saying it sucks and it's like it's it's not done I'm just yeah I agree with you it sucks yeah yeah yeah I'm with you yeah this is our workout but some people know that some people understand that some people think they're come to see if most product most people now today in 2019 yeah crowds are great yes it's just one person in 50 shows complains and it's you know because there's so much shit to look at like controversy gets people to stop at your website and then you get credit from the advertisers in the side and then they they gas up shit and they donate they you know I saw a guy recently talking because you know suede everyone in the internet hates me but I walk down the street and everybody loves me so it's just like so what is what's really going on there's what's going on is is the small that percentage that don't like you is being shown to be the majority you know well it's a very vocal minority who get upset about things and they're very they're adamant about it and they're very active that's what it is the people that are upset about certain things people that are and they're really respond specifically it's long if you know because then you can do exactly nine times out of ten exactly what they're complaining is being done to them they turn around and then do trying to find their justice and they just I don't know the irony seems to be lost on these people but like I don't talk about I try not to talk about that shit a lot because I don't want to give it any more added weight than it deserves and it's just like bullies if people bring it up I just say you know not everybody's gonna like me yeah I don't know what to tell you I don't need everybody like I just need enough people to fill up enough of wherever I'm playing so I can continue doing this that well it's only that like as a comedy fan like what you're doing right now like that what you're doing under special the stuff that I saw working out before the special is what I always wanted to see as a comedy fan that's what I like I like I like people who take risks who say crazy shit that you know you know is you're walking out on a line you know you're on a wire you know I want to see you what like the dead troops bit you're walking a fucking wire and you could feel it you can feel buttholes clenching up wow you start the bit I love it that kind of comedy to me is the most fun especially now at this day and age with all my years in comedy if something still makes me go oh shit where's he going yeah the thing is if you're gonna keep being a comedian then you know how to do it yeah so then you're just gonna be bored if you just wrote shit that you knew the crowd was gonna like about la but to then challenge yourself to kind of a can i yeah can I say what I think about this in a funny way that doesn't put people because I don't I am NOT that guy I don't want to walk the crowd I don't want to have people waiting to yell at me right there's certain people that liked it and kind of want to be that person that's not what I'm trying to do I just want to make you laugh and I definitely you know will steer into err okay I have a lot of silly shit through but I'll steer into some areas or whatever but it's all like just done and fun it's just done in fun it's just so you just listen some idiot in a bar that's all you do exactly and if you're not there to see that well then you picked the wrong play it's not legislation now you know go home yeah I just saw a great quote Joan Rivers said that when she separates of all time what'd she say sanika media should never apologize for a joke it just means you didn't get the joke and that bitch was ruthless oh she was ruthless till the day she died she was ruthless no I saw her I saw her towards the end of a life and I was just going like I couldn't pull that off I couldn't pull that off but like she was also somebody that like was like Carlin where it was they didn't just go Kay I got here and we're satisfied they just kept mmm going to higher and higher levels and that I'm telling you if you watch her on The Ed Sullivan Show okay in the 60s when her act was at versus the 70s and then the 80s than the 90s this very few artists that you watch that their trajectory is this continuing climb Jack Lemmon one of my favorite actress of all time you watch him in the apartment his great is he is in that Jack Lemmon and Glengarry Glen Ross blows away Jack Lemmon in 1960-61 because you know not like I know the guy but like if you don't take the ride is what I call it you know when people say yeah yeah you says yeah I'm fucking yeah that that's when you just level off and you start to go back down if you keep going like I can learn from younger people you know from older people peers you'll continue if you but but it's it's constant like work yes if you put the work in like I'm hoping because both of them fascinate me equally Carlin and Joan Rivers how they they went they went like this you know and and I'm Carlin was so fucking out there I thought there was comedians that didn't get what he was doing towards the end and now you go back and watch what the fuck he was saying in the 2000s and all of that shit is happening and it was just he was ahead of the curve if people thought he was overreacting or now he's just this angry old man it's like he saw where yeah don't you need to go back and listen he's trying to warn you about some shit and he was just a hundred percent I mean just fucking up on the money like I can watch shit that he said in 1990 and be like yeah like that that actually I know what that is right now like that's it's it that's not like you that's almost like 30 years ago and you don't watch it like he's up there like hey take my wife please it's not like this it's like a timeless thing well some people I think the struggle of doing the work of showing up the clubs of grinding that feeling of you know go on stage with the seeds of new material and eating shit not knowing where they're going to Taking Chances going on a limb and failing and then succeed and then finding punchlines and new new ways to take the bit and then all you one night you ad-lib something and holy fuck that's it this is the whole thing a little piece at all that yeah you find a wormhole into another dimension and you you piece it all together people get weary they get tired of doing that I think it's a retirement but I also think I think it's a the fear of those stories we were talking about earlier is like the humiliation of trying to learn how to actually be a comedian yes or being in a band anything that involves getting up on a stage you don't want to go you don't want to feel that again right so I think people will like okay I'm doing this and this works and then then says fear well I'm finally drawing tickets because everybody I'm give a fuck who made it like most of us had that feeling in a comedy condo of like am I the guy who's not gonna fuckin make it what am i don't and that fucking cold sweat failing I I think people who stopped growing it I think part of it is that you don't want to go back to what the fuck did I said something the other night on stage and it bombed so fucking bad it was like a vacuum I can't go back I didn't get sucked into my own bike it was a chest it was a lot an old joke to get it so I could get a drink of water like foo not tighten up the midsection I was just sitting there like right in the liver liver shot it wasn't a liver shot because I would have gone down and we'll plexus it was yeah it was definitely I had to regroup and get back on the yeah I'd stepped into like a sinkhole that one that that could still happen though I like that that can still happen I like things that scare the shit out of me I always have I'm into them I'm not into safe things I like it when it goes off the road and into the trees I in certain parts in comedy I do I don't like that in life ya know personal relationships oh no not gonna get scared I don't like that either yeah that's that could be a problem yeah I think that we all can learn like if we keep doing it I think one of the dummer era told me this too he goes Joe one of the things I really love how many he was I think I'm better than I've ever been he does I've been doing this comedy for fucking 40 years I agree I agree with it as well but it's because his love of it you know Dom loves it like he'll go on stage in the or and they're bringing him up you know ladies and gentlemen you see this kind HBO and this and that and then there's all those fucking credits and he walked onto that stage with a big smile on his face is the best part of his day yeah he's gonna go up there and fucking murder anybody give a better shitting on you in a intro than him one of my favorite things that the store is like Dom's bring you up I can't wait to hear what he says about me yeah and it's always like this he does his complimentary while he's taking your photos he's a fantastic on kill Tony he's one of the best guests ever on kill Tony because you know okay yeah because those comics go up and they do one minute and so many of them are brand new they might have done stand-up once or never before and surfer can't believe those kids had the balls to do that so as I would took great show it's a great show because of that and Tony's such a great host and him and red band fucking with the people but my favorite by far side guest is when DOM is a guest check that because he's so fucking good at it he's so good at shitting on bad comedy they have complements you and half shitting at you at the same time I used to love a show that he used to do at the Laugh Factory busting balls with dimer era yeah he would do I did that yeah they would sit on Jamie Masada say that you did say that you did ban me from the club listen to all this shit I don't know who put your stuff on YouTube was not me buddy he's not me but then ya die never owns up to the fact he banned me from the club one time that never happened what a man you he was doing this thing where he wanted people to work clean or something and I went up there and admittedly I you know just some nights you get on stage you start saying fuck and you can't stop it was one of those sets and he goes buddy what happened man you know you go up on stage you fuck fuck fuck all over the place man and I just laughed I thought he was fucking around and then I all of a sudden I wasn't getting spots and somebody gave me advice call him up and apologize uh and then he knew he had me I apologize and then he just fucked with me how long ago was this late 90s fun times fun time they were not fun times in the store was not fun but he would go down the store there was like nobody there and it was just these fucking famous comics which is drop-in and they would do like hours oh yeah anyway and they didn't do the work they hadn't written anything and they're just standing in the mics in yeah so what else is going on and they were teaching all these young comics they're like someday when I get on a show I'm gonna fucking do that I'm gonna come in their house and I remember being like this is what it is what the fuck is this and then this all late 90s then I went down to the improv in Seinfeld just write his Seinfeld had wrapped up it was the first time I was seeing him live and it was like Jerry's popping and oh okay I want to see Jerry and he had a 20 minute spot and he did 20 minutes it came up he opened with something that worked he closed with something that worked and he worked on his new shit in the middle twenty minutes got the light wrapped up thank you good night I remember thinking like that guy's a fucking pro a pro yeah there was a time where that was a thing to do were guys but you know and I think Chris Rock would do it work that's how he would come up with material and he would party would say to the audience don't get too excited the shankha that funny right he would say that like he would go on after somebody that killed like someone to do like 15 minutes right of all their best shit and then Chris would pop in so Chris would go up afterward and he go what else what else and he would like I think it was a strategy to put himself in these bad positions hoping he would find a way out of it and then he would take those little chunks that he would find when he would find a way out of it and then build those into bits but he knew he wasn't one of those guys that went up and just did two hours not two hours because he was Chris Rock you do like 20 minutes yeah was always like whenever I saw him pop in I would always watch because he was worried he had written stuff yeah and he was working on it and it was I know who you're talking about yeah yeah I know who talking about exactly yeah that would do there's a couple guys that would do that yeah oh it was the worst it was bad because they weren't even trying to be they weren't trying to entertain the crowd and they talked about them being famous yes and by the time they were done the fucking show was done people just get up and droves cuz it wasn't entertaining yeah yeah yeah well those days are done you know that's the beautiful thing there's no more of that a couple people who tried do that you know a couple people have come in like fairly recently that are famous and run the light and then done 45 minutes to try to do that and they can't come back they've had a few of those people try to stop in I never I never thought that that would I always thought that Fame would win that one that's that's that's good to hear that the guy and they're actually doing the person a favor well you know why they can't do that anymore that's the shows are sold out every fucking night at the store and it's packed with killer comedians you can't do that anymore you can't go on in between you and D'Elia and Joey Diaz and just what else what else you can't do that anymore those days are done yeah you got to bring it after Joey those days are done yeah Jesus Christ Joey Diaz we leave a fucking hole in that room he leaves a hole and you got to fill that fucking hole in before he can even start to tell jokes yeah I love Joey he's a monster I've never seen anybody kill harder in my life I've been doing comedy 31 years I've never seen anybody kill her Joey he has a command he's a monster you know and he goes out there it's like alright the captain's here yeah he's a monster he hit some hind and also by the way he's doing comedy from 1990 he's doing comedy like me - never happened the internet never happened there's no fucking rules yeah it does not give a fuck and just really doesn't kills because murder people yeah don't give a fuck what if I had an ax toxic right fucking wait they say it's just like they know they're seeing jokes they know that he's fucking around right he's funny yeah and it's good that's the other thing too it's ridiculous outrageous but it's also really well word well worded well shit right yeah this is how much good come somebody was telling me there's a thing out there now that if somebody shows up who's hard of hearing you're supposed to have a device for that to help them out and if they don't they can sue you so there's a there's some fucking ambulance chaser hard-of-hearing guy going around so when well I've done shows where they had a sign language horse and you've done that right well they have to do with certain theaters like but my thing is it why is it on the club it's like you know your hearty hearing yeah how the fuck I gotta hire somebody yeah if you have a limp do I have to make sure there's a cane there I did cobs once and there was a guy in the audience that was deaf and he actually hired someone to do sign language so someone was sitting facing him while I was like he was facing me and someone was sitting like say if if Jamie is the audience member and you're you're you know like this TV's worst an abyss this lady was doing this and then doing this to him doing this and doing this to him and the guy was like like kidding wha and so I was going what's going on here and then I had to sort it out right all you hired her to do he goes yeah I bring her to Lena we explain I bring her to to comedy clubs how could you bring her movies like he's like it's like this guy had this lady that he would hire and she would do sign language for him look good for him though you didn't make a big deal out of it he just he hired somebody that's actually great so you can go to movies and nobody talking bugs him people eating their popcorn too loud he doesn't he only needs to see a movie once he gets all the fucking dialogue he doesn't get the music the manipulation the music gives you that shit doesn't work on him oh that's interesting yeah this music drives me nuts in movies I mean I like it it adds to movies but there's sometimes when I'm aware of it that's when it bothers me when I'm aware when there's like piano playing and the guy and the girl holding hands when I come on right you didn't need to do this to me or if they pick a hacky song oh that you've seen in like 40 different movies it's like alright yeah yeah that was cool when Scorsese used it in 1980 but so it's an interesting thing because it came from the time where there was no sound in movies so they would add a musical soundtrack because movies were silent and you would see the screen with the words would come out so we from then associated movies with music it's a weird thing like these people are talking there's a shootout there's a fucking fight and I'm in a scene in a movie in a comedy club or whatever in the movie and then this music plan and all this stuff's going on like why is there music playing why you manipulate because they've always had music in movies so from the time they had movies were there were silent there was music playing in the background they just kept it in there like it doesn't make sense that music is in movies you're showing me scenes of things that are supposedly really happening and I'm supposed to be locked in like the really happening but there's this unexplained fucking music the corresponding action on this there's an art to everything for sure if use properly yes sure there's art but it's amazing that we automatically associate those two things together right because music is a totally different thing than a movie but yet they're inexorable to us we I wouldn't want to watch jaws without that fucking thing boom yeah of course yeah fuck have one that's all I would think when I'd hear that no it's back I wonder if when they first invented movies if they already had invented audio recording because it's kind of crazy they invented video recording before audio you would think that it'd be no there used to be a tendon if some person would be playing the piano sure sure sure sure they did that too yeah that's what I thought on I think I think they did that too but they definitely if you watch an old silent movie there's music playing you know I watch the thing on I like those Turner Classic Movies and I was watching this thing they did a whole thing on Buster Keaton was fuckin unbelievable it was I was I recorded I've watched it like three times do you like I broke his neck doing a fuckin stunt it wasn't even aware that he did it he was definitely in pain he was doing some gig that some bit there was like a train coming down you know the water spout thing that you pulled down yeah the joke was that it came down on him but they didn't understand they didn't you know the physics of it how hard that water was coming out and slammed him down onto the train tracks you don't there's so much water you don't see how he hits but he broke his fucking neck and didn't realize and then years later he went to the doctor with some headaches or something like I don't know what the hell it was but the guy was going on he's just looking at the x-rays like so don't you break your neck because I never broke my neck he goes yeah you did yeah I dislocated my shoulder apparently one point in time and I didn't know I did it I got an MRI and doctors like you dislocated your shoulder I'm like a fucking lunatic I would have been flopping like a fish out of water if I did it you know who else broke his neck in a movie Stallone when he was like 65 and he's doing the Expendables someone threw him into a wall and he snapped his neck to this day he's got bolts and rods and his neck it's all fused together whoa yeah you see an x-ray of his neck it's fuckin nuts pull up an x-ray of Sylvester Stallone's and talk about a guy still fucking giving people their money's worth 65 you won't even do this stunt double this show is like the Sylvester Stallone fan club show because everybody like like whenever his name comes up like the other day Eddie Bravo was talking about all the fucking movies it's got the guys relevant from Rocky one in the 1970s and now he's doing like Rambo 14 or whatever the fuck it is he's five years old September 20th yeah he sent geriatric old man Holden I coming to get you he's still at it they're still at billboards everywhere Rambo people are psyched probably gonna be the number one movie I love a stunt man didn't use a stunt man and broke his fucking neck and then Ancestors out there any time ago you want the stunt man to do it always say yes look at this Tom Cruise delegating himself to the side of a plane this guys are crazy look at his neck so he's got a cage scroll up oh my god yeah so his neck is fused all those vertebrae and screws and bolts that nose never come out never that is his neck for life not only that it compromises the upper and lower discs so that when your neck is fused like that that's an unnatural sort of condition for those joints so the upper and lower ones there's there's additional stress and it's an unnatural leverage point yeah fuck that fucking dude he did 65s that screws and bolts his neck and shit they threw he got thrown into a wall and crack what does it say Stone Cold Steve Austin was so fucking vicious I end up getting a hairline fracture in my neck I'm not joking I haven't told anyone this I had to have a very serious operation afterwards now I have a metal plate in my neck yeah yeah Stone Cold Steve Austin who's you know who's also hit broke his neck oh you broke everything all those guys have ever no the guy was putting him in the piledriver oh really and he was supposed to but you know leave distance you're supposed to have like the guys heads poking through when he jumps up you kind of ease up with your legs so at the last second you tuck your chin I guess right it was how I watched him explain this shit and what the guy guy was like freaking out that he's fighting him or something like that or he fucked up oh look you can see it right there oh yeah see that he just he he didn't do it properly he dropped him right on his fucking neck I mean oh this is almost broken I would have probably fucked up his disks the craziest what was crazy was he was supposed to win that match and then he was just fucking laying there so they didn't know what to do so they just took his arm and just put it on the guy's chest then they were like one two three over oh my god yeah the craziest one I ever saw was Brock Lesnar he did a flip through the air and landed on his head flipped through the ice 300 pounds flips through the air I think he called it a shooting star press or something that he would flip through the air to land on somebody but he miscalculated or he slipped or whatever when he did the jump off the top rope Oh God 300-pound gigantic man lands on his face didn't even knock him out just continually and just fucking pinned the guy afterwards watch this because this fucking oh god this just freaks me absolutely preposterous those scroll to the end where he flies through the air doesn't they're like just a highlight of the available we used to joke that that guy was so big like that's that the sword tattoo is like actual size yeah it's right right before that right before that because that's that's where he's K out yeah right before that so scroll a little bit before that a little bit before that just right there click there ok so it must be right before so it seems like they're showing highlights here ok they don't have it on YouTube I think it's cuz he's good at the animals getting eaten alive yeah this is it here yes here it is this is him oh no watch this look at the size of that motherfucker it looks like a cartoon it look boom he missed Oh landed head first look at him holding his head most humans are dead right they're just dead oh so Kurt Angle's trying to pin him nope hugs him off did the idea that you're even alive when you land a head like that he just totally miscalculated he's so lucky he's not paralyzed oh yeah well he doesn't have a neck he just has shoulders that go to the top of his head and he stays with the storyline huh he popped out wow that's a fucking pro Wow so he gets the big bucks yeah he was thinking about coming back to the UFC up until just a few months ago he's gonna fight Daniel Cormier they were holding the heavyweight title because they were gonna match matched him and Daniel Cormier but then he just decided you know he was doing some legitimate wrestling with some real national champions at Michigan State and him you know I think he got to a point in his life he's like especially without steroids because the UFC has very strict anti-doping policies and the last time he fought he tested positive and so it was like look I just can't do this I'm not gonna do this and plus when he was on WWE there's not a chance in the world he was pissing clean I mean so for the years after the UFC when he was on WWE he was taking one over the fucking water - and whose giant built like a fucking brick shithouse and then they're like he's like I want to fight one more time and if he's gonna fight one more time he's got to be clean so he's got to enter into the you sada testing pool so he's got to be in that testing pool for a period of several months before they'll allow him to compete so they're testing him this whole time such a dumb fuck I was picturing him getting into a pool no and I'm like what do they do what'd you sweat they figured it out get in the pool we need to clean you to find out if you're on steroids but again he was that close I mean he's like I so glad you continued to talk to that point or a little bit I would have drunk they got a pool and they get in the pool they make you do some laps in just the water if there's steroids in it why the pool I just think it's more accurate you just keep answering and you don't have an answer you just give one oh boy all right so fucking giant human being you see is that's Viking DNA right there kids yeah yes it is all right let's wrap this bitch up huh yeah let's get in a sauna relax do it it's good let's do it a sauna ladies and gentlemen
