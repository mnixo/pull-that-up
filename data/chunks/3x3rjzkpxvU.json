the Joe Rogan experience for sure he's gonna win again I'm gonna be the president so you think for sure he wins again because is that because whoever the Democrats decide to put in is gonna be an equal turd sandwich again you're a super smart dude but you're also a bruton your big giant savage motherfucker right so how many people have underestimated you because you're a big giant savage motherfucker plenty talk stupid to you and acted like you were a moron I'd say equal street fights two fights in the UFC yeah there's a lot of people right the and just people in general like they'll get snotty um takes TV at jury I'm good men but I think there's a certain part of us that might be doing that with him I don't think he is I think he's really good at winning this is this is not a nut like up an endorsement of him no caveats necessary I'm horrified by this immigration policy of separating children from their parents I think that's subhuman his wife came out and said that was bullshit yeah his wife's an immigrant bro his wife barely speaks English it's chaos right it's crazy I hate I hate all that stuff these are just families they're just people who love each other you got to keep them together if they break the law you keep them together get them out of here if you want I mean if you want to send them back to where they came from if you're you're hell-bent on that but taking them from their kids is subhuman I mean it's beyond it's not us it's not what we're doing in 2018 that aside all that aside he's probably kind of fuckin win again man I think he's probably win again I think he he gets in these confrontations with people and they think he's a dolt I don't think he's a dolt I think he's there's no way he could be as successful he's been I know he's heads ups and downs and shit like that but like what he just just the way he was able to dismantle all those guys in those Republican debates it he tore the fucking third part on the part they had no business they had no business doing that with him they just were too emotionally tied up in his responses there was so much negativity and energy it was like oh it's all this anxiety like a fight where a guy is in full panic you know you seeing like street fights especially guys just go into full panic or even just talking shit in the schoolyard you know like yeah one guy's getting bullied Molly's got the crowd watching him and the other guys like will butBut you'reyou're fuck you man yeah no no he's like oh that ain't gonna work you know that's kind of that's what the rest look like Ted Cruz that's what they all look like he's just been doing this his whole life he's been talking shit his whole life you know and he's got a lot of fucking supporters and if the economy keeps doing good man it's gonna be a hard sell to put some guy in there like Bernie Sanders who you know all the right-wing people think just want to give away all your money give away all your money to welfare brats even the left was protecting against that yeah right cuz there's still money more than the left I should point out I know jack shit about politics this is very important to point out hundred percent I've read all the tattooing uh works almost all of them he's brilliant trainer I agree with that 100% outside of competition let's explain it to people yeah okay so yeah let me okay so let's say for instance let's say you know I'm a big believer never being sore you should train and the next day should wake up feeling good okay no why how's that possible well because look if okay that's great that's a good example let's say let's see your energy levels I'm talking about fit people by the way right every human being every so guys never worked out before maybe first day first day never taught was it possible to worry about and not be sore no problem okay here we go let's say there's something called rate of perceived exertion okay so let's say I make you do pull-ups and let's say the maximum amount of pull-ups you can do the maximum amount of pole is 10 let's keep a nice wrong number at 11 you couldn't do 11 if I put a pointed a gun at you you couldn't do 11 should I make you do 10 pull-ups on our workout now I'm gonna make you do 5 why because I'm setting you up to work the next day the next day we're gonna do 5 and the next day we're gonna do another 5 and then we're gonna do 6 when six is really easy we're gonna do seven why if you count if you did 10 pull-ups on Monday you're gonna be sore still Thursday what's its really your max so Thursday you've only done 10 pull-ups from Monday to Thursday you've only done 10 pull-ups me I've been doing 5 pull-ups every day so I'm at 20 pull-ups already 25 pull-ups mmm I have more volume than you now if you add up at the end of the year who trained more I've trained way more than you so let's say I go to jiu-jitsu practice I'm doing jiu-jitsu every single day three rounds five days a week that's 15 rounds you go in twice a week but you kill yourself you do five rounds each day you kill you push yourself those last two rounds you burn yourself out I still did 15 you're at 10 at the end of the year I've done countless rounds more I may have had so much more training than you so how much training can we pack in in the week that's the real question how much volume can you expose your athlete to so I always tell people look energy and sorry exercise can produce energy so let's say I'm feeling like a 7 out of 10 10 being I'm really like energized 1 I was like a really lethargic feeling like I need to lay down and 7 I'm feeling good ok if I get up and I do a right amount of exercise the right amount I can feel like an 8.5 exercise can give me a tonic effect like drinking this coffee so let's say I just do some jumping jacks I hit the back for a couple rounds I'm feeling good once you get that high shot it down don't go into the phase where your body's beat up tight broken up don't redline the body that's only for training camps for a pit for a small period of time why because you get a little bit more from the system but in the long run you get less in the long run you've taxed the system so if you do that regularly by the time you actually get good you'll be broken up is you know a realm of experience a realm of knowing that these things give access to that's normally close to us I mean that's kind of a trivial statement of course but then you get down to questions of how verifiable is that how real is that how you know and and people get I don't know if the term is hung up but they can get baffled when you start talking about you know the reality of say the entities you encounter on DMT I mean this is this is some people I know are obsessed with trying to verify the reality of the entities that you find on DMT and again it comes down to if you experience them they're real yeah if anything you experience is real because you've experienced it does it have a corresponding existence in the external world well you know what's external what's internal you know we we throw around these terms these these epistemological metaphysical terms quite carelessly you know without really thinking about it what does it mean when you say I'm in here and you're out there you know and then you take a psychedelic and you realize that's not official boundary you know we're all one there is no separation it's separate in normal consciousness though it's separated in normal consciousness but then what is normal conscious right if not a reflection of your neuro chemical brain state I mean everything you experience is an altered state because it's filtered into this brain processed by the brain and you know the brain is a biochemical engine that you know as I say often we were made out of drugs but it seems that our normal consciousness is the best state to propagate biological life and to keep our Tsar whatever we've created in terms of our community structures and relationships and friendships and the ability to build structures and houses and things like that these all these things are done best when you're here and present whereas on a psychedelic state I agree with you well the way I've always described it is if you had a meeting with God and you went and God gave you all the answers to the world and you you experienced undeniable beauty in the most extreme form possible where you couldn't have imagined it and then you came back whether you hallucinate it it or not it's the exact same experience exactly I can't put it on a scale run away it like we've stretched the tape measure around and God is 47 inches across like just because you know I'm saying just because you can't measure it with what we term our you know our metrics for reality right and that is exactly the the thing don't worry about whether it's real and the way we would define real is it good information or is it bad air is it not that's the thing it doesn't matter where it comes right it's such as if it's good information then it has its own internal validity and whether it came from some part of yourself that is normally obscure to you or it came from the plant teacher or the aliens transmitting it through it doesn't really matter it's a little what but I just remember being a kid and like my uncle wasn't married or had kids I was always like huh what's up with them smart that guy it's partying seems going through Almar route do you purple without getting me to learn that's right you do I saw you did you one of those people thank you one of those people you're not okay okay you don't you're wrong you people there's no God okay if you think there is spare like ah I know everything yeah you smart guy that shows a weird show everybody talking over each other [Applause]
