three to Youngstown the house how are you brother good how you doing thanks for doing this man I appreciate it no thanks for having me on I appreciate it you were out here working with Danny Garcia no I Garcia Mikey Garcia and Garcia camp also I came out you know a couple things as we mentioned earlier a buddy of mine Markel Micah throwing some ideas around and kind of just taking a week out here in California to you know keep moving it's nice right yeah yeah it was nice and uh Ohio Believe It or Not and then this morning they woke up to like three inches of snow so I'm out here enjoying and they got the snow well the thing about LA is no one's from here so everybody grew up in a place like Youngstown or something like that like you were saying you're running into a bunch of Youngstown people out here tony angeli I've got super excited to see you absolutely I'm worried about that I'm excited to see him and he's excited to see me and it's uh it was really cool um you know I've heard of Tony and I knew of Tony you know before and everything and then I to finally be able to meet him and somebody from Youngstown that's doing you know great things it was kind of cool so ya know it was cool hanging out with you were in Columbus - it was a fun time I was those good eatin stew yeah what was the name of that place again you guys picked it I think is Italian market I think whose joint was as that it was your friend this friend of a friend Matt Browns friend right I don't remember the name Matthew mortal yeah another good guy yeah I gotta tell you a funny story with him we're at my gym and he came and did a seminar at my gym and you know I have just a fitness gym right now there and he was going over and he was showing people when he kind of came in and I was showing like a little punch and a hook and he started doing a elbow off the hook now I'm a pretty big guy now since I retired and I'm you know and I'm working on losing weight but he hit me with that elbow on my arm and it just hurt and it was slow motion he wasn't throwing it hard and I'm gonna get this son of a bitch really wanted to turn that over I wouldn't want to get hit by the elbows are awful bones are awful it's like it always weirds me out that the UFC has a little padding on the gloves but there's no padding and your shins no padding and your elbows no padding on your knees it's a terrible way to take a beating it is and people get into the brutality of it a fortune out cuz that box I think box is more brutal only reason is because if you get dropped in boxing you got ten seconds to get up your brain could be rattled in the first round and you could get dropped four more times than that fight you got 36 minutes of fight and unfortunately in MMA yeah they're hitting you with the knees the elbows and if you go down they usually stop to fight yeah rightfully so because somebody could come down with an atomic knee drop and you know I'm just saying it's or anything can happen in it so when you were fighting MMA wasn't as big as it is now but did you ever think about doing it no and be honest what you know but I was always interested in it I was I was always interested in the martial arts actually that's how I got into boxing was a young kid taking Taekwondo and and I don't know if that's how you pronounce it but okay and you know I got into it with that it was to me it was kind of like boring I'm a young kid you know I was full of piss and vinegar and I wanted to actually get in and do something and I played other sports but uh you know then after I retired a little bit I kind of strayed away from everything in the fight game and um and I started getting interested in jiu-jitsu and stuff like that and how old are you retired thirty thirty that's young yeah still I am pretty young how old you know thirty-six yeah you're still in the range yeah no that's effective range oh that's why I've been working out and I know I kind of slowed down on the powerlifting a lot and been doing getting flexible again so you haven't had a fight in six years do get to itch that's why I'm saying you getting the itch right now yeah really yeah I've been well another reason what why I came out and was talking with mark and everything but you know I don't want to lead nobody ever on either you know right this is something you just think I'm really thinking about it and I'm working out losing the weight but at the same time there's a lot of process behind that I would have to sit down with the family just go over a lot of things you know are you doing any boxing these days hey I've been working out just sitting - bag pad stuff like that um you know I've still lived him but nothing he jacked dude look at the size your fucking arms I know I was at middleweight son know that then a cruiserweight is that the nice area right now that's the range yeah anybody bought you sick and I'm not fighting not that guy's scary as fuck yeah and I don't you know the thing is everybody I did I mention this a couple weeks ago and the first thing that came out about it was he needs the money so I can't win for losing you know what I mean like because there's other things right now that we're talking about actually been in contact believe it or not with Dancing with the Stars and oh Jesus so I'm having fun with it now I guess don't make no joke so I tried to take a fight rather fight you sick believe me fucking hard work man talks talks of it yeah which mark my buddy marks doing I've had a couple friends that have been on that yeah he said it's brutally hard work it is that Virgil Ortiz it was a fighter been on it so that's where it's going why I don't want people also the rumor mills start nut he's broke he needs the money because it's absolutely not the case so you retired healthy yeah he retired young and you set some money away but still like you were a world champion for a reason you know you had to become a real world champion you have to have some crazy Drive some competitive fire inside you yeah there is a you know a lot of people don't understand in any combat sport combats combat I'm a not patting myself on the back I don't know if it's even good to say but you know car combat rolled champion athletes and fighters mentality wise you always going to have that mentality you know Brian and my only reason why I'm even throwing this around and I guess that's the right term to use because if nothing comes up I don't want to backlash on that either because I'm still only 36 and I'm at that point where I got that small window still you know where I'm not 40 right I'm not 38 and you know I have been healthy for you know four and a half years and I've been working out and what me just tried to go powerlifting I know it tell me exactly right I was tired think about it I was so damn skinny if I turn sideways and stuck my tongue I look like a zipper you don't I mean um and being six foot to 100 and make it happen to make 160 pounds even between fights you still had to maintain you know your weight and I got tired of that uh what was your walking around weight I'll walk around about 173 that's not that bad no that's not and MMA that's real light yeah and you know and then but as I got older yeah I started getting a little more difficult to you know keep that and I started getting up to like 175 won almost 180 so now you're looking at a and I'm still skinny at that point so now you're looking at having to lose 20 more pounds again to get down at that age and it came to a point which caused a lot of issues for me and of one fight with the Martinez fight and after that we had to jump up hmm yeah that point of diminishing returns right we got in too much weight when you fought Jermaine Taylor that was 160 right yes yeah dude I was one fight where I remember getting angry at Larry Merchant Larry Merchant is calling a fight on my side he wasn't recognizing that you were tuning him up and you were hurting him and you got like he was he was commenting on it almost like is a trend that he expected to see rather than what was actually happening there was a lot of things about that fight I loved him guys because believe it or not in my opinion that was a great fight and I seen that day had that fight in a top-ten middleweight one of the top 10 motorway fights of all time and that's kind of a cool thing but also you know some of that commentating though really made that fight especially at the end and my opinion made that fight kind of what it was also you know besides the fact me getting dropped and everything but um you know I didn't agree with the judging of it you know cuz I still had me ahead I went back and watched it I'm not one of those egotistical people either like I like to really break down what happened in that fight and I and if I lost around I would say I've lost around you know I was hard on myself with that I watch that fight now probably 10 times and I don't see where they had Germain winning you know yeah I gave him one round and plus the ten eight so it's a total of three rounds and I don't see how that happened well you know I mean we've had this conversation a hundred times in this podcast but judging and boxing and judging in MMA judging is just terrible yeah it's just tear it's well it's sad it doesn't make any sense there's so many experts out there there's so many really reliable people that you can call on that would do a great job of figuring out what's going on in a fight and for whatever reason they don't get those jobs I think they got to start doing something soon in boxing with that yeah they have to figure something out with the judging Charlo fight yes yeah yeah there's a handful of people I had the argument with that actually thought Charlie lost I didn't think that he looked as good as he could have a knife fight yeah but I thought he won the fight you know 116-112 but I don't know what system they could try to break down for that and or try to get to actually start making someone in fights fair but boxing is doing fantastic to past two years I mean the numbers are crazy you see him with his own did with Canelo and yeah so it's it's taraf just tensions at the sport and popularity of it's coming back but what could eventually hurt it again is things like that the judging of the fights yeah the outcomes well there's certain ones where you want to like you want a criminal investigation like Tim Bradley Manny Pacquiao that was one where after that was up I was like I was looking at the TV I was looking to the side I was looking at where I was like what the fuck did I just see what just happened here that fight right there I actually had to walk away with my head down I thought that was probably one of the worst robberies that I've ever seen it was horrible robbery I searched to give Tim Bradley two rounds I gave him one I was trying to give him rounds to Kyle like say how where did you get to set the in other words and I couldn't do it yeah I loved him Bradley too by the way awesome guy awesome awesome fighter too I mean he's just all hard because he's amazing but that just was a a decision and you know I think there was a there was a lady that was responsible for two really bad decisions bird yeah a bird was it her was it was there's another one too there was enough addley bird she does have a made - I want to say uh yeah Letterman's daughter baby well there was no there was another lady who retired from doing it after that decision it was like a big controversy people were that her score was so off people were thinking she got paid off just so many anymore though it's hard to keep up with it yeah well the thing is and in people that are cynical or skeptical do you know how much money is being bet on fights especially a Manny Pacquiao fight there's so much money if someone like Pacquiao is a prohibitive favorite heading to ten proudly fight I mean who knows it could be 4 to 1 5 to 1 6 to 1 someone who rolls up with a nice brown bag we got in here it's $30,000 I'd never have to report I think just yeah there's more behind why that happens - it has to be that's always been the idea that there's no bribery going on anymore it's crazy I don't want to say it but I think I have yeah I think I have an idea you know I think it comes down to who's putting the show on mm-hmm and who's who's in the pocket but Teddy Atlas was explaining that to when he was on the podcast one of the things that he was saying was that they take these people out to dinner like like they're all in cahoots and friendly with each other and if there's a certain result that the promoter would like to see these judges will lean towards that if they have a good relationship with that promoter you said it for me yeah that's what it did look Teddy laid it out and I don't know yeah it's bad because the given box is really coming back it is and the fights you got three or four weight classes right now that's so interesting but the bad part about it is you don't get interested in it or you don't get as excited anymore because you're afraid of the outcome of the fuck yeah you know I wasn't terribly upset at the wilder fury decision I wasn't terribly upset I thought I thought you know what I think Tyson Fury did enough to win but when I look at it I like when I like when they scored damage means a lot to me when I look at that fight when when Wilder heard him he heard him twice and he heard him real bad I mean I think that's worth a lot and I think he was always threatening so I felt like I don't know if I would agree with a draw I think it was a close decision win for Tyson Fuhrer but I didn't hate it I didn't hate it because I think I'd like to see them fight again absolutely I mean those one of them fights were yes you're a hundred percent right that it couldn't in the draw and I think everybody would be kind of satisfied with that yeah unfortunately with the accountant knocked down which I was so frustrated with the the comments and you know how to stay away from the social media and the boxing groups and and things like that because all just you know the some of the opinions of people as the way to put it that was a long count and this and that there's been thousands of fights in the last ten years and I've very seldom heard anybody complain about a count you know that that fight they don't do a 10-second count in boxing they go by the referees count right and for another thing we're water kind of hurt himself the referee tells you in the locker room before the fight and he explains it to you just go to your neutral corner if you come out of your neutral corner I will stop to count you mean you know that so the first thing I used to do when I drop somebody is I ran my ass to that neutral corner you know so that referee to start counting I didn't see any issue with the knockdown I even recorded it on my phone and if you did go by the 10-second count Tyson Ferry still beat it really yes I have it you know I'd have to go through and find it I thought I saw it on the Instagram or one of them it was I think it was on Wilders Instagram or he had it where the count starts right when Fury drops I counted it was his back almost right before his back hits the ground into where he got up and again that's only a 10-second count got a referee even coming over to him you know okay but you know as far as the the fight itself I gave I gave Walter obviously two two knockdowns that's automatically four rounds but I thought and I gave him one other round after that I thought Tyson ferry controlled the action you know I had control the momentum of the fight on the flip side of it I think that water actually could have made that easier fight to you know water actually has a hard time with his control he don't know how to really work to the body I don't want to put it on a trainer I don't know what the issue is with that but he neglected that body a lot throughout the fight and I just thought that's why I Tyson won most of those rounds you know he just controlled the action the pace and was kind of able to do what he wanted to and I think that if water went back with his trainer and watch the tape what a fight they're gonna see a lot of opportunities that were missed in that fight well you know what's crazy about Wilder is how little time he's actually been boxing I mean it's really stunning when he was on here he told us that he made it the Olympic team a year and a half into weren't learning boxing yeah and he won a bronze medal in the heavyweight division no you could kind of get away with that - yeah you can you know most of your heavier ball back then also we're big guys who came up usually most of them were football players or something like that and they kind of just got into the sport and still even to this day you're talking about maybe three heavyweights that really could throw down as where some of the other guys are just big sloppy guys that come in right you know so what do we got now you got Luis Ortiz you got fury you Wilder Joshua who else Joseph Parker yeah Parker you know and I think right now Parker is one of the guys that could actually still upset anybody in heavyweight division yeah especially with that style yes yeah so it's getting interesting again no it is is it certainly well I think with Wilder and fury that was one of the more interesting heavyweight title fights in a long time and and while there so it's so weird he's so different he wastes 209 pounds he's skinny as a rail he hits you it looks like you got hit in the face with a missile I mean it's crazy because that isn't missile he's firing fucking crazy power that kind of is and I try explain to people on that too you don't have to be a big guy yeah you know it's all about the leverage how in the tork were you generate that power and you know he's just one of them guys that that's one of the things were you either have it yeah you got it in the cradle or you don't and that's another one you try to explain even like in baseball you use our home run hitter or you're not you know you could work on a little bit and maybe knock one or two more home runs out or knock a guy or two out more but if you don't have you're not going to unless you really go back over to find the time and patience to reprogram that fighter and change the whole style yeah it feels like one punch knockout power you either have or you don't yeah and but the guys who can put it on you and stop you like Julio Cesar Chavez never had really that one punch knockout power but he fucked a lot of people up and he had that body shot too he didn't need a knockout punch to the head dude he was so perfect when he was in his prime the way he would fight was constant bobbing weaving moving in and then once he put that pace on you it was just constant damage constant punches the volume the volume the accuracy and the fact that he never got tired he would just keep that pace up a bap bap bap bap and you would see guys just start to wilt just backing up all the time just wilt under that pressure then that's the depth that body attack that he had how he invested into that body from the early rounds people carried those punches you know they carried that into the fifth and sixth round and you know it was brutal you know I couldn't imagine fighting I fought some tough guys but I was glad you know being a tall guy had nobody ever went to the body like that I guess me I would have hated that it's a fucking rough way to make a living bro there is Chavez in his prime goddamn it was good whoo he was so good I mean it's just constant movement too constant cutting angles and the fucking pressure another one like it was Duran - that's Roger Mayweather right yes yeah Black Mamba yeah people forgot about Roger now you just systematically broke you down Shabazz yeah very tactical and and textbook and it make many mistakes it wasn't flashy he wasn't overly fast he wasn't overly powerful but he just broke you down the right way and do the right punches yeah that's what that's the best way to put it through the right punches he was just relentless and he was constantly moving forward constant pressure goddamn he was good yep and you know Oh Gregg Helgen remember that was great how said he found a bunch of Tijuana taxi drivers and he beat the shit out of breaker yeah this is left hooks the body there's just like tough taxi drivers young fighters man you want to like emulate a guy who just fought with perfect technique this is the guy well you know that comes down to another thing that I was breaking down I actually I touched on it on my show a lot and a lot of people get mixed up and confused on a fact of foot work with people and some of the guys that had the best footwork in boxing were not flashy guys with the footwork or even like Mikey Garcia now or like a Bernard Hopkins is another one but you had guys for now word occur I know I'm gonna probably get beat up on this he had decent footwork what I mean by that because because yeah he make you miss but for now would occur a lot of times put himself out of range by moving like that you know he makes that move or he'd do it too much and then he wasn't there to counter so what good did it do you get guys like Chavez or Duran or guys like Mikey Garcia now they take that one little step inches and angles they take that one step in turn right in position for that punch they take the opposite step to suffocate your punch you know and throw you off they spin you around you know that's where footwork comes in and Shabazz was great at that yeah he was always in range he was always in range he was never never running away and yeah and his like you know the guy who does it the best today about cutting angles and being right in front of you can't him his little chenko who low mishchenko stands right in front of you and then he's not yeah and then he's over here and he's punching you in the face TJ Dillashaw who's a UFC bantamweight champion said he sparred with him and he said the first round was like you know Loma chanko was just feeling him up just figuring him out and you know he's like now I'm kind of hanging in there with this guy and then his dad yelled something in Russian and then the second round low mashenka was just dancing around him stepping to the side touch and unfortunately that was the only round they put on YouTube - you know what I mean yeah I seen that you know what to think what Loma chenko is this yeah then and I tell people also like Floyd Mayweather was is unbelievable defensive fighter but Floyd was rude good on drawing you in you know and kind of countering off that his defense and his reflexes were amazing but he kind of lured you in a little bit made you miss make you made you make a mistake and then he would counter you yeah loma chenko on the other hand as a guy you could throw a punch and that punch could be in midair and he's spinning and he's already behind you yeah it's the athleticism is astonishing I have not seen it granted can't he lose absolutely its boxing and if you get one of them rugged guys that are just gonna come in and say you know what screw it I'm gonna I'm just gonna get hit but I'm going to hit him that may be a type of fighter that beats all mishchenko well who was it that was the the Mexican guy who beat him in one of his first fights Oh Solis little Salido right right right yeah that was the foot kind of fight that he fought yeah just dirty got on top of them but you got to understand on that point shoe that was a low mischenko ii pro fight yeah and i guess a real veteran yeah a guy who's been there and done it and seen it and that's the argument it's hard to explain again then that was another argument on his dad gets a little frustrated reading a second pro fight usually in boxing though it goes like the first year you're up for six second year you maybe you start getting up to eight but you get a good amount of fights under your belt before you start getting into the 10 rounds and twelve rounds okay you're talking about a kid coming out of the amateurs fighting three three-minute rounds or four two-minute rounds depending on whatever tournament or international tournament it is and he's going right into a Charl 12-round fight I know myself coming up and the process that top-ranked brought me up which was a great process to they've had they picked two fights and they made sure to the face that they picked for me were two correct fights and they groomed me the right way you know by rounds and everything else and I know just jumping from six to eight the difference in that you know let alone being a kid and you're going into your second Pro fight and you're fighting a 12-round fight so if you lost that fight which he came back and he made it a really close fight I would have to tip my hat to him just on the fact that he was able to go to all rounds yeah you know people take a lot away from from that fighter what he accomplished is something that not many can do well it's crazy I mean he had a second pro title at what how many fights in yeah the second fight was for the rule title that he wanted to rule title in his third pro fight yeah that's insane and then but he's had more than one perp world title right mm-hmm yes he's won at a good three different weight classes right but his second one was something in some insanely shorts he pull up his record yeah I believe I look at the source if I was what's that says his first fight was for the International featherweight title but that was against Toledo Ramirez he said he lost against Toledo for the vacant WBO featherweight title okay so the other what was the first title international featherweight title WBO yeah that's not a real that's not like a world title there's a they have a bunch of weird titles right like international tighter continental title here you're assaulting me I had a very oh I had to do with the world champion yes you were unified well it should have been by all rights but Taylor vacated to oh that's right yes but he's you know that's why I get mad and that's for another big argument boxing how you break that down between the lineal the lineal and unanimous you know I had to ring the WBO scroll screw up CeCe's homework so what was his uh okay so his second world title was one retained retained one okay one two three four five six fights in he's in a second he's a he that's when he he he wins his second title six fights in he wins a judo lightweight title that's insane yeah the international okay that wasn't the first one wasn't a real title fight it was the right but the second one was the WBO world title fight eleven fights in he wins his third world title what in the fuck I believe now there was at one point it was seven world champions and just that short period of fights I believe it's around 8 now 8 world champions he's fought in just that short period three different weight classes I think when he fought were Gandhi ow you really got a chance to see how he handles a real world-class you know cuban amateur system trained top of the food chain boxer and he just put it to that dude that was the fight that actually really sold me on lomachenko yeah because i thought for a fact that that was going to be a chess match because of the boxing ability from rig and outlet their styles were very similar yeah and i thought that you know I was like it's going to be a boring fight for the first like four rounds which I stole are like because I like watching that type of fights you know and I see I go in there and I'm expecting this fight you know the amateur background of both guys the how talented the guys are in a skill level of both guys and then next thing I know I'm two or three rounds into it and I'm going he's playing with brigand oh yeah playing with him I'm going to hell that's the fight that really sold me on low Machiko that he's that good my man Vinny Pazienza called that not Vinny Pazienza the boxer Vinnie Paz a rapper this guy Jedi Mind Tricks he called it he was taken he was taking bets on Instagram he called it that early - yeah seems taking bets on Instagram you think you're bragging do is anything for him he's like climbing the DMS he goes it's bet I took low mischenko in that fight but I thought it was gonna be a close fight a really close fight and I thought Loma chenko was gonna pull ahead in a later rounds you know when that fight that so that's why I really surprised me you know well it was a stunning display of talent he's such a weird guy too because his background you know the story where his father took him out of boxing and made him do traditional Russian dancing for several years and just made him learn that for footwork it seems like his dad was just a mastermind architect of a champion yeah you fight no more on this the nutwood didn't he also have a martial art background I heard he definitely can do martial arts techniques I've seen it but I don't know what I thought of arts background maybe yeah I don't know that makes sense he's uh his footwork though is so extraordinary and if that really is that dancing background like learning the the footwork and the the way he he's so agile with the stepping of his feet it's like I think a lot of people are gonna learn and mere that yeah his training regimen is pretty blue also I got a buddy uh Roger Romo a good friend of mine he's actually he was working for a little while there up until the last fight he was a strength and conditioning coach what Cecilia Flores who was mine when I was in Oxnard training and they said it was just crazy that the hours that he puts in how he trains how hard he trains and some of the girls that he does you know I'm looking at him and going I could use these not for me but I could use them for somebody athletes that I got now yeah he's um he's definitely something special and you know you get those guys and it's just it's kind of ashamed that he's a little too small for Terence Crawford you know I mean I really would love to see those two fight but it seems like Crawford's just a little bit too heavy for him I agree but that's a you know that's another touchy subject because I kind of agree with you but I also go back because I'm always trying to really break down and and nitpick I look at guys like Manny Pacquiao mm-hmm who was who came from I believe 112 or something like that and went up all the way to junior middleweight which is crazy yeah he's small shorter than than Loman chanc yeah any other in his calves I don't think anything else is much bigger than Loman chenko on his body and he was able to do it and what the fuck is going on with his calves I don't know it's like he's keeping hams in them I don't know what he does I you know I wish I knew the secret today because I could use it so I hid that secret to John Jones this article says that his mother was actually a marshal or still is a martial artist oh interesting yeah mmm gymnast a martial artist well it makes sense boxer yeah man footwork the way he does it is just it's something to watch man it's just the ability to move and also to anticipate the other fighters movements it's like especially earlier in his career it's like he was fighting guys that just they seemed so crude in comparison to his approach yeah you know what's even more crazy about it as being the opponent because usually going to a fight and you break down film and you're going over to film and you got a good idea of what he does right what he does wrong and and what you might have to do long and chanclas hard to pick up where he's gonna go he different angles so you can't you can't go well you know what after he throws the DeRay and he likes to move over to the left because he does at one time and then the next time he's totally somewhere opposite you know what I mean and yeah the angles it's really almost impossible to break film down on him you know like this last fight was just Pedraza everybody's going that was the blueprint no no it was it you know he in her saying it was a close to fight and you know people expect it I go why cuz he finally got hit with more than eleven punches in a fight oh that's him doing some assam bow up yeah he's a trained it when he was a younger greco-roman yeah yeah he's he's slamming kids that's right well you know what man I believe in cross-training and I think that there's certainly some skills that would make you better at different martial arts and I feel like if you have the ability to wrestle guys and move guys bodies around like that you would get from something like Sambo I just feel like as an elite boxer having that extra strength that extra ability to move your core that way I think that would be beneficial yeah you know the thing is no world-class boxer has the time to also be doing judo and also be doing wrestling you just don't have the time no and being in combat sports even I know that as far as I'm not involved in him MA but I know that you know these guys they have to perfect three or four as much time in a short period yawn you know I imagine I think Matt was telling me you would know more like sometimes it's two days of one two days of the next trying to fit that in yeah it's hard you cannot especially in boxing the sweet science where it's just hands but you got people that's all he do all day long right that's why I say it's so unfair when an MMA guy goes into fights at Mayweather because Mayweather he perfected that yeah and you got to use just that style of boxing it's gonna be almost impossible to be in a box or a roll champion boxer did you watch the New Year's fight that thing that he did with the attention yeah yeah yeah a lot of people think that was a fixed fight I think that was a hundred and twenty pound fighter fighting the best ever yeah I mean it's just this it wasn't a fixed fight I don't know why people think it's a fixed fight that guy fights it 126 pounds I think yeah I think that's his weight class and you could definitely tell the size just like I could actually tell the size difference though when McGregor fought yeah Lloyd you know I think both the Floyd's legs equal to one of McGregor's yeah but yeah it's that tension that fight the first knockdown was legit yes and I think my personal opinion what happened it wasn't fixed you know were fake I believe that he got hit with that right hand and it seemed that how strong and how to defense the skills that uh Mayweather had and I think he said you know what this could be a long-ass night and then the next couple punches he just kind of like went down because he's seen what could happen he knew which way that fight was going really yeah that's what you think I do the first knockdown let's go so let's play that fight see if you can find the fight and play it I feel like the first one clipped him on the temple he hit with a left hook on the temple he didn't with a right hand but didn't hit him with a left hook the right hand and then he hit him afterwards as well as he's going down but I think that left hand to the temple is what did the real damage and then then there was a big right hand afterwards that dropped him I just think he was out of his League he's away way out of his League not that he took a dive but almost to the point of like he knew that that fight was not going anyway - wait he thought it was he looks he was so smiley and relaxed it was kind of funny you know he just sort of walked the dude down he had a big ol smile and say look at him smiling well as last night and he's so much like my kid right yeah he's fighting like it's a joke look at him he's so much bigger than this kid what's really funny is if they let this kid kick he would fuck Floyd up yeah okay Floyd made it look so dumb and I didn't even know on that part but then again that kid his kicks that kid would have kicked Floyd's legs out from under him in seconds Oh what you went too far there see he got up right there boom see he hit him with the left hook and he stumbled and then he hit him with the right hand behind it and I just think he's too little he's just a he's a very small guy and for him I mean and Floyd's not a big guy this kid is tiny I mean I think he's fought as light as 121 pounds and I think sometimes he fights it like 126 yeah maybe I think you can see right there right there sometimes at a fight a lot of times in a fight the whole issue is you get hit with that and you're fighting if somebody taps you with a certain punch your brain you'll be surprised how fast it works you know and all the things that go through that mind boom yes that's that was it yep and I think at that moment right there he just knew going in you could fill just was somebody hit you on the arm or a shoulder you know how much power they have and I think he's just trying to after that he knew that was gonna be a long night so crazy they paid him nine million dollars for this must be nice [Laughter] yeah I mean fuck there was a lot of people I seen going up he deserves to give some of these prospects a chance now you know he should be fighting these guys instead of doing this these guys ain't boxers blah blah blah and my take on that also is the man went 40 49 50 you know he fought almost everybody in the sport even if you wanted to say that they were past her prime some of them may have been a little bit he still went in there and dominated them and beat them yes this guy in my opinion if he wanted to fight defensive backs from the NFL he has all the right in a role I don't think that he owes the sport anything I think actually it's the other way around the amount of money that he has brought to the sport the attention that he brought to it so if he wants to go around in duty size shows let him you know I mean what do you want to do fight prospects though he's 51 years old I couldn't agree more I couldn't agree more it's crazy the idea that they they want to see him sacrificed yeah they want to see him get beat that's what they want they want to see him finally fight someone who's younger and faster and hungrier who's more active and what will happen is that he will lose and I think maybe we're smarter than that you know he wants to go out and keep that his status and and and the the record that he built up and that resume that he has and go out like that yeah well they're talking about him fighting khabib nurmagomedov who's the UFC 155 pounds and pin but Kibby he's not really a boxer he's I just want to say but boxing rules yeah that would be a same thing yeah Kabhi was a takedown ground-type yeah exactly it would be the same kind of fight as the counter fight the only difference is I don't think could be but get his tired as Conor would yeah I know I don't think he's definitely got better endurance I think one of the only few in there right now that would be a good fight would be one of the Diaz brothers as far as striking that would be interesting but they that he would box their face off he said I still think that he would win that but I'm just saying as far as you know stand up and letting the hands go I think those are one of the one of the two better ones in the MMA yeah I mean he's got all the right in the world to just keep fighting freakshows doesn't have fun man and you know wait with her the only thing is you know father time shows up you know he's getting to that age where you might get one of them guys and yeah so I mean Evers having fun do it but if you go and get beat by one of them guys I could change the whole outlook of a career well it's interesting how guys who are really good defensively they're not just really good longer because they have such good technique but also they've taken less damage during their career so that they're more durable as they get older as well like you've definitely saw that with Bernard like Bernard up until the Joe Smith fight me Joe Smith was the first guy to really put it on him like that and knock him out of the ring and it was hard to see it was hard to see that they they had that ring set up to where he fell and landed on his fucking head Jesus Christ you know I don't know if those so much to ring I just think it was an awkward way that he went out of them ropes yeah in a way because he got hurt by that punch yeah so and the legs buckled and when the legs buckle like that they could put him in that awkward position for him to slide out you know ass was headed out and get clipped again went right through but I mean it just sucks that there's nothing to protect the fighters if they fall out like that there's no padding there's no no tables no nothing nothing to break your fall no one there for you just got to hope one of the ringside judges or commentators or their - that's crazy and you got guys that are 80 years old yeah try to push a 200-pound man back in the ring yeah they're not gonna get clipped like that and one to somebody falling on them but Bernard was able to keep his skill very late in life I mean deep into his 40s almost a 50 years old was still world-class which is really crazy that is you got a handful of guys out there I could do that and to be honest you know but he kept himself in good shape in between fights yeah and he did what he was supposed to do and some guys you know you get some guys out good friend of mine my trainer Robert Garcia retired at 29 a young style guy Mancini retired young and came back a couple years later but it was only for one fight because who did man seen you come back against Greg Halligan oh that's right yeah yep and some of them you know some guys they go in and do it and it's fun and then it becomes a career a job and financial security you know the way a lot of fighters look at it and then you get some guys like Floyd Manny Pacquiao Bernard Hopkins who just loved the sport you know that much that that's they don't know anything else outside of it so what was it like fighting Bernard who you know and I don't know if this is the state stage I wanna fighting Bernard was it was totally different than what I expected would you expect I expect him to be tricky and sneaky and then just very crafty and obviously experienced you know I did jump up to weight classes to take that fight and but at the same time that was not an 80% Kelly Pavlik and this is true and this is documented I have it in my phone and I was gonna actually bring that out but that fight I sparred you know three times for that maybe for the fourth time was one of our embrace and then it went into it and I'd never said anything because I'm the type person I don't want to have people think that was making excuses I love Bernard and I think he's a one of the greatest of all time greatest middleweights but that was not that night you know I came down we had what's wrong what was where I had bronchitis I was sick I was running a temp actually in the locker room we had to go through with the Commission we almost took the inhaler for it then we found out through the commission that you cannot take that because it's steroid so we had to go to the nasal or not nasal tube the pill Horo pill we had it in the locker room I don't know if you ever heard of a guy Thomas Hauser he writes yesterday from New York Times he does a lot of big boxing books he was in her and Hauser don't he's not one side with anybody he's brights what he knows what he sees and that's the truth and he was in there when a commission came in they were going through my prescription you know whatever taken the temperature given me the exam and that's what happened how it was a little dark fight with uh of all people what was wrong with your arm you know yeah burst burst leg burst like a society's bursitis in your elbow yeah and you know that came into an issue and we sparred we don't like I said it was a handful it might have been more than three or four but it wasn't a lot because usually in training camp you do it three days a week for about a week camp for about six six and a half weeks and it was because your elbow that you couldn't spar yeah you know he didn't want to keep pitting and then I didn't like just the way I am I didn't like having a brace on it or nothing so that was an issue and there was a lot of things that sometimes if you could go back and you wish you could do it over again but there was a lot of other things going on why we didn't postpone the fight first of all is sold out and Youngstown people bottle the tickets we had the issue with the Paul Williams fight you know that if tall true so I can't I just came off fighting Gary Lockett who was really not a well-known name a household name so if I would have postponed that fight the backlash on that would have been bad broke man and you know sort of it was more to ego thing that I think and worried about what everybody was going to think taking nothing away at all from that's where I wanted to tap into taking nothing away from Bernard Hopkins unfortunately against a guy like Bernard Hopkins that had to have that happen to me is what sucks and he was a tremendous fighter I mean he did things in there a lot of times I seen him making moves that I knew what he was doing and I just couldn't pull the trigger on it and he was fast and he was strong and then there was times that he just did some crafty things also that you know got to me and his body work and I fight slowed me down a lot but just one of them fights where I could honestly say that that was not an 80% Kelly Pavlik and that could be honest to say if I was a hundred percent I don't know if I would have won that fight and I'll be honest about it I'm not gonna be the guy that comes here and says well I thought was 100 percent I woulda knocked him out no it's Bernard Hopkins you know um when you think about your legacy and you think about looking back at your career those kind of fights where you had to take it when you were compromised um how do those factor in to do those fuck with your head mm-hmm yeah that a real bad way right but enough where you like if I was a hundred percent yeah you know I got invited to the International Boxing Hall of Fame over to summer and was cool sell and be there and you start seeing the inductees and everything and I start you start breaking down your career like am I am I able to qualify for this you know and it's soso gonna get pissed off who didn't get in because I got in and I look at it and I break it down a couple ways I say forty and two with 34 knockouts is a hell of a record you know I held the belts for over three years I beat a handful of guys that were legit when I beat them and then I'd look at the fight though I fought Bernard Hopkins and I got my ass whipped in that fight and there's no other way of putting it you know it's the truth so how much did that damage you know people remembering that nobody looks at the fact of the two weight class jump and they come back down and defending it against a very game Otoniel Rubio and then of course the Martinez fight which a lot of people and it was documented and and on HBO with the commentators you know the weight issue and that fight but what was the way to shoot another fight so how we had to get down that was my last fight at middleweight you know trying to cut the weight I was 29 at the time and another great fighter it happened it was tough with the weight I really can't use that as an excuse no cuz I don't know but you know I know I was doing good in the ninth round I did hit a wall a lot of people try to use the cut and I think even without the cut the same result would have happened though you know he would have box my ears off the last four rounds it was just one of them things that there was nothing you could do so when I when I have sum up my career I look at those fights and I and I know personally that they could have been different but at the same time I'm very happy and content with the way my career went you know I was 40 my last four or five had one my last four fights you know before I retire so I went out winning and and I was done with the sport I truly was and so I think right now I'm kind of content and happy with my career of course I think anybody says could've been better and I wish it was better it may be a little bit but I'm not gonna have ever beat myself up over it well it's just one of those things where you when when you look back and you think of all the great things that you did accomplished then you realize that you're retired at 30 yeah so much so much room there you know 30 is so young is it you're in your athletic prime they I think they say 32 for a professional fighter they consider most athletic Prime's at 32 it was but you know I look back on and again you know the 42 fights that's a lot of fights yeah plus I started when I was nine I had a little over a hundred amateur fights George there was a lot with that I mean for a while there well before I retired I was throwing it around you know retiring I was one of them guys that just I liked it and I loved it but I also sometimes got tired of it Brian oh I'm a very simple guy and and I don't I don't care about the glam or the fame or any of that I truly don't you know like even now with my my podcast and what I'm doing with some of these other adventures because I got bored and I'm gonna have fun right you know what I mean and keep myself busy and I've been fortunate to have what I have to be able to do all this on my own you know and go out there and be around everybody but yes so when I was fighting you know there was a lot of rumors around of the retirement this that and I think the final icing on a cake was we were supposed to fight Andre Ward and that's when Andre Ward ended up getting a shoulder surgery and that fight fell through and I've been out in California training or an Oxnard trainer for almost a year which most fighters leave at the beginning of their career you know when they don't have a family when they're not making the money that's their opportunity to try and go make money not when you're 12 years into it you know and so I went out there and that kind of took a little bit from here as far as the sport even though I loved it and it was great training with Robert Garcia I learned so much that I didn't think I could learn at that state point in my career and but not that Andre Ward fight fell through I was I was done I mean I was I've rolled over I never forgot I rolled over told my wife I said I think I'm done and she goes what are you talking about and I said I think I'm retired and she started crying of tears of joy because she wanted me to be done even before that she don't know the sport or right but what prime ages are not and I hung them up and you know over the years as we talked earlier hearing her I would get the itch you know and that could have been just going to the gym and doing around on the pads but I just didn't never wanted to keep doing it you know my health believe it or not is more important than not anything else well that is something that every fighter has to consider like when have they fought too much yeah how do you make that decision when your heart when you lose it in here in that heart a little bit it's a horrible hobby to have especially at that high of a level yeah you know because you're not fighting guys that are getting off work at 3 o'clock and right you know you're fighting guys that are legit athletes and skilled professionals that fighting and it's dangerous unfortunately we've seen and know when we're talking about this with me getting the itch earlier there's a lot of things I take in consideration like I'm really into it and I'm really debating on it and I'm hitting a gym working boxing did I see things like this Adana Stephenson situation yeah you know and those are the things where I say I got to sit back and talk explain to people what happened he just he got hit it was a good fight he's been fighting for years now one of the most feared fighters also in boxing he thought the guy we were talking about earlier yeah I can't pronounce his name I don't want to chop it up pull up that the Russian gentlemen's name we yeah there's a way to say it it's a that better be but I see them all that Donna Stevenson it's Russian catsup some crazy-ass names man they do I know it's hard you know me being a guy involved in a sport and talking about it all the time to how hard it is for me yeah to get it down there's so many badass Russians these days okay it's one Bostic yeah it's GV o ZD YK but it's vosdek you don't pronounce the G vosdek he's in these two men he is beast so in that fight again a darkness Stevenson is a brutal puncher devastating knockout puncher he's been fighting all these years now also and this is the part that's test one right yes yes and that's another situation or you know factor factor where you might want to say hey I'm done right no even before this happened unfortunately had to get to this point but uh he's inert and it's a fairly decent fight from what I was watching and next thing you know he goes down at fights over and he dropped Fosnight get some part in the fun he did yeah and he next thing you know he ends up in a coma you know fighting for his life did sport you never know that's the scary thing about it you know you can get injured two weeks before the fight and sparring and have a little bleed that you would ever know you know no signs of it and then the next thing you're you're in a coma yeah well I know that that really fucked up Roy Jones jr. when Jeremy Maclin who was his archrival you know this was the guy that they thought one day he was gonna fight when McClellan was killing it at light heavyweight and Roy was 168 pounds and and then you know to see McClellan now you know people who don't remember man McClellan was a fucking destroyer he was so goddamn scary and so good and he hit so hard and he was the guy that you know he's a chronic fighter you know in the vein of Tommy Hearns and all those other great chronic fighters and people looked at him like man one day that's gonna be the fight him and Roy Jones jr. was almost like it was inevitable yeah it was like Canelo in triple G or something I know cuz everybody does the fantasy matchups and they asked me if I have like verse McKellen I'm going what are you guys trying to do to me I don't want that fight you know I mean because he did hit that hard brutal guy yeah and then to see him when he fought Nigel been same situation lapse into that coma but we don't know how a Donna Stephens and it's gonna come out of this but I don't a lot of times when a guy does have a traumatic brain injury like that like they're never the same again yep that's what I'm saying it could have happened that could have been something two weeks earlier that was never detected you know or signs of it so it's scary it is so you take that into consideration but you also have that itch yeah you know and again I am 36 is it something that again it's gonna be a process of sitting down and discussing you know see would you say you like 60% considering fighting again maybe a little more right now no no no I know we do you ever like go back and watch like highlight reels and then you start shadow boxing again and really start thinking about it and it's weird because I'm in my German and there's people lifting weights and I'm gonna back I got a couple of bags back there and I'm you start hearing the bags popping and everybody they're not used to seeing it so everybody gets curious and they come back and you see them like peeking around the corner and watching me hit the bag and then I get a little embarrassed I'm like alright you know what I'm just gonna I'm gonna chill with it right now so yeah it's uh it's fun it is it's a thought again and we'll see but a lot of that plays in my my mind because the one thing is it becomes very selfish to at a point I got two young kids at home you know that's gonna be 13 and 10 they're involved in sports and a lot of activities they love me being around for it and it don't take me half in a fighting usik right for something to happen right you know what I mean but we'll toss it around and we'll see how that goes yeah that's um that's a big consideration and a lot of things the factor in on that well especially because you are busy now and so what made you decide to do a podcast actually I was excited when I heard you were doing that I was like alright do the podcast where I am I'm looking you know I hear some of these guys uh commentating and I say I think I could do that ya could use after listening and the podcasts were kind of throwing around I had like I said I got a handful of investments going on and I pick and choose on what I want to do and the podcast started off hey let's have fun let's throw this podcast on we'll get some cheap equipment you know I got a lot of followers on social media so we'll do like the social media live and then we'll also hook it to the YouTube and we were doing it and it started off for a little while there no advertisement it was kind of lonely you know if you feel like I'm talking into a mic and nobody's there Ram and then it started taking its doing fairly well right now coming downloads again man right now well the social media is the biggest we end up hitting it reaches out after the first episode you had 2,000 people were reached and maybe like 400 views and then as the days go on and the shares go on you start seeing it reaches out to over like 20-some thousand people and then you see you know like eight thousand views so and that's on social media you got it the YouTube is the one I'm working for you know really trying to push and right now sometimes we get up 113 views on there and then sometimes I don't even want to mention how many views are on it so again it's a process with that also I know that's starting to learn that it's about consistency that's the most important thing I get out to these fights and people know it you know who I don't comment on a show because we do it words it's live the format of it is to have everybody involved because they like that they get asked questions and we're pretty much faces on the phone reading the questions as an answer in it and I think they like that and actually it's kind of funny because we'll get some great guest on there we had TJ Dillashaw we had Mikey Garcia Terence Crawford on I think you got a I think you could bring back Joe Lewis and put them on there and people don't care about that they want their questions answered you know through the social media or through YouTube and they kind of don't interact with the guest that you have one so it's weird um I think the format I like the format of it but at the same time I wish people would be more involved with the guests that we have one hmm but for the most part it's fun it's different but that kind of format it's well boxing fans in particular well all I should say just combat sports fans in particular they love to comment on things love to get in on and I mean whenever there's a big fight the social media just lights up both with boxing and with MMA they do and the ability to go back and forth with a guy like you and get your questions answered and stuff like that it's got to be huge yep and we tap in we've had Matt Brown on so we tap into the UFC I personally don't want to because I don't wanna make nobody mad I don't know enough i watch it and i can't make anybody mad I know I'm saying that some of the fans you know I watch it I enjoy it but might now the co-host James Dominguez he's really big into that you know and he was the one actually introduced me to Matt Brown and so he knows so on that show asked where we worked you know hand-in-hand together like he's able to do more of the questions and I think it's fun when boxers don't know about MMA and they asked wonky questions yeah that's how I feel with you know vice-versa I'm sure man I'm sure like when you when a big fight goes down and you do watch it and stream live we do what we tried we'd actually try it on that that's a great idea for someone like you that we do a thing called the fight companion we do it all the time with there's a UFC fight we'll put it up on that screen we'll have a good bunch of guys in here and we'll watch the fights and talk shit while the fights are going on and people play it alongside the commentary so it's like they're watching the fights with us yeah that's what I did thank you it's great yeah yeah absolutely is and that's the whole thing we're just looking for a different plus if you if you go into the comments and start you know having people ask questions like who do you think won that round then you go this is why you know I think triple G won the round this is why Canelo lost the round or this is why you can make an argument that Canelo want it that that kind of stuff for that kind of interaction stuff it doesn't a fans love that they love it yep yeah they love that and that's that's what we're you know we're looking at different ideas to you cuz you'd never stop learning you could never stop you know expanding and doing things like that so it's good and you know we get places we get to these big fights and and people notice the show you know hey I love your show even if they don't you're saying that to me you know yeah it was very keen inside yeah you know and it was cool actually what was that the first triple G Canelo fight you know when I retired I again stayed away from box and I went to that uh I went there and I was all about promoting my podcast and it was kind of cool I walked in there and everybody went crazy in a media room and I thought I was fighting again after after five years being retired I thought I was fighting I mean they were just asking and I was trying to squeeze stuff in and telling what I was doing and then it was cool also cuz Bernard Hopkins was there you know and I was just I was already a year into the powerlifting I was still about two thirty and he came up and gave me a big hug and you know it was awesome to be able to after a fight and being able to go in there with him to see how nice he was and how humble he was after that you know you could have been cocky right he could have walked past me and I said hi or recognized me at all right he was just really brought me in so that's cool yeah What did he say to you after the fight did you tell you need to box like a black guy I think he did you know after that fight he could have told me everything he wanted aneroid he could sat down for an hour with me and I wouldn't remember what he said I was you know everybody seen the fight so I need not to say much more on that but uh yeah a little bit of it because my trainer was there it was you know keep her head up you're a hell of a fighter you know and you know I'm experienced and go back go back to the drawing board don't get too down on this and come back strong he goes you're a champ and that was what he yeah I remember something where he said that you needed to learn how to fuck block yeah I didn't hear that I truly didn't you know hey maybe he might have said that an interview after was somebody and that's what people thought right I know he didn't say it in a fight right yeah yeah that was that was a it was you know one of his best performances I mean he had so many great performances late in his career the Tito Trinidad fight in particular because nobody nobody thought he was gonna win that fight that was he was a big underdog in that fight Trinidad was up-and-coming rising Puerto Rican superstar I was fucking everybody up and Bernard put on a show I thought you know I actually Hopkins the knife fight though because he was just bigger you know the big guide middleweight China has moving up mm-hmm and yeah there was a lot of good middleweight side and think trend that was going to be I think Trinidad was a amazing fighter but I think is great days were at 1:47 yeah I agree yeah I was I mean he was a big puncher though I mean he was a big punch or even up into light heavyweight I mean even into middleweight middleweight but he was his style was almost tailor-made for Bernard so now I was so so clever and such a good counter fighters so good defensively he didn't really open up he didn't leave many openings that goes back to the footwork that we were talking about you notice in when he fought that fight even when he fought me but trying to add and other guys when they go to throw a punch he take that one step in and kind of suffocate the punch especially pulls a straight right hand or didn't he would take that step and he would overthrow that overhand right and catch you with it so he was really good at just putting that foot not moving around much put it in the right spot to hit you and counter you and he did that Trinidad was probably one of the best technically solid fighters ever if you actually watch him you know the way to his punches he'd never made mistakes on that part of it but I think he needed a little bit more changing up a little different with Bernard Hopkins in order to have even made that fight kind of close one of the most ridiculous Trinidad fights ever remember when he fought Ricardo mayorga and mayorga let him punch him in the face yeah he just put his hands down go ahead and in trinidad teed off I think he hit him with two left hooks on the chin Margaret was crazy he was so great that was a crazy dude smoke cigarettes three rounds and shit I don't even know if I could believe that I don't know if that was a showed he did that when the cameras were on because he was able to go a handful of rounds without getting tired yeah I know if you smoke a cigarette Matt's gonna take the wind out of you yeah but you know I know fighters that smoke yeah yeah Joe Schilling who's a world-class kickboxer top of the food chain world champion kickboxer smoke cigarettes whoa crazy fucker yeah I chewed most of my crew that's different though right it is you know Chicka teen restricts the oxygen in the blood and it's not good for boxers or anybody lifting weights with nicotine does like chewing tobacco Restore yeah restricts the oxygen in the blood I didn't know that yeah but it's but can you just make sure this is stimulant though you know it's actually like for your brain people say the a lot of folks I actually bought some I never tried it but I bought some nicotine gum to try to see if I would write on it like if it would help me writing like because it apparently works as a nootropic as a cognitive enhancer nicotine is actually an effective cognitive enhancer I didn't know that maybe how much you take of it the quantity yeah I don't know I mean I don't I didn't know that it it affects your because it's a stimulant I didn't know that it restricts the oxygen your Bo that's what I heard and choo actually more so than cigarettes because of the amount of nicotine and how it hits he gets into the stream faster but to me it was never I didn't shoot a day of the fight right and I believe after so many hours six to eight or ten hours it's out so but either or didn't affect me that stuff so now so that I was able to run you know three miles in 19 minutes 19 some minutes and five miles in 30 minutes and and I was and I was chewing it so it never really affected me well maybe it did but just you were in such good shape barely no smoking on the other hand lungs filling them with it is horrible and uh but after I retired and the itch wasn't there for like a year I wanted to give the gums a break and I decided well you know what I'll smoke at quit smoking shortly started smoking cigarettes after you retire yeah Jesus Christ I don't want to start to move starts at 30 I was switching out that it was nicotine here oh here it is smoke tobacco smoke listed back on health risks the amount of nicotine the bloodstream after using smokeless tobacco may be higher than that of a cigarette smoker okay what does it say about oxygen now that's where it was going to death this puts it all together the nicotine base is taking the place of the oxygen I think is mm-hmm what the other intern it's a less scientific paper but nicotine stays in the bloodstream longer with smokeless tobacco than cigarettes oral tobacco which causes heart disease yeah okay it's not a safe alternative that's what it's saying all right yeah no I'm bad for you but you started smoking cigarettes yeah Cup was this not because I'm a smoking when you're drinking kind of guy is that what it was no it was because I wanted I like to nicotine no you know I true you know and I wanted to give the gums a break the lips a break and I smoked sigh wait I didn't have to chew and uh doing the lifting and power lifting I went over and I think I got seven squats and I couldn't breathe Jesus and I said you know what this is a shame how long have you been smoking for that was only eight months you're several months that's long enough on it you know and yeah I said you know what because I had no plans coming back to the ring I didn't so I was done and yeah I got two seven seven reps into the squat and I was like you know this is sad I was a former you know world class athlete so I was done right after that day but the singer is back well good for you yeah I'm sad you started it up but glad you figured out to let it go yes you that's a that's a weird choice though at thirty yeah I can blow this nicotine you know ass well a lot of people do when I try to quit to chew and they go over to the smoke and I don't they just go to the gum usually you could do that too but some people just like it yeah I don't know well it does it does juice you up Tony Hinchcliffe smoked cigarettes he doesn't anymore but he used to and a couple of times I took a cigarette from and smoked it before went onstage and he's like dude you're gonna get hurt he was worried about me you're gonna get over my I'm not gonna get hooked yeah I'm just gonna smoke this one cigarette not gonna go buy a pack but people are so scared of it yeah well I see why though yeah you know especially again you know as I'm mentioning I'm over I used to be able to do all that and then I'd use seven reps on a squat night and I'm having a hard time breathing and I racked it now granted were squats are hard though I mean you're gonna yeah if he's pending on the weight and how many reps are doing it's a different type of exercise but you know I was done after that so you had a drinking thing for a while too huh yeah that's that's one that uh that gets a lot of Fighters yeah it does but it's one that you know on that that it ticks me off and it don't it ticks you off yeah how so you'd a lot of it was ran through the hometown you know and the troubles that I that I got in with it TMZ stuff like that you know the incidents that happened were petty small and if it was it wasn't in Youngstown it would never made news stuff that kind of happens shit the BB guns and again yeah I shot a a kid were playing around I was taking care of them and this is the truth of the story taking care of him I was putting a big lake in my backyard and I got the country boy I mean I want I went out and rented two excavators and some Bobcats and started putting a the pond in this uh this guy I was helping out he knows how to run two excavators so I needed work he had no money I was taking care of him and his kids over at the house he's he's working so long story short after about five days I come home and he's in the pond or lake just in his underwear playing around I grabbed a BB gun I'm joking around with him you know because we were shooting targets for a couple days in between work and I shoot him in the in the arm 42 years old it's the 41 years old at the time too so it wasn't a kid he gets i he's like i you shot me and he's crying about it and everything else and the next thing you know he he's cool though he gets out of these it's on Facebook and he's giggling laughing about it and he stays at my house that night his kids come over I'm feeding them we're having cookouts the next day and little things that I don't know that I'm glad that I'm not involved in no more or I don't put myself in that situation so he stays for two days after that at my house and his uncle comes there who worked for the sheriff the local sheriff's department and goes hey is uh so I'm so here and I said yeah he was I haven't seen him no and he goes okay listen he goes Kelly I'm coming here to tell you so that way the news the media everything else don't come he has a warrant out for his arrest and tell him you know if he comes back call us so he leaves I go walk it through the house and they come Brian comes down the steps and I was like dude you get the hell out of here I was like I didn't know anything of this you having a warrant but blah he goes over and passes out on my couch I call his uncle hey you want him he's here so he finds out he ends up running out of the house and they catch him you know that night or whatever they could they think him in he does two months and County Joe gets out takes his uniform off walks over to the sheriff's department and presses charges on you yes for shooting with a BB gun yes and a buddy of mine who was there when it happened was video and it his girlfriends laughing in the background you know when it happened that was it was just a video of it happening he'd sold it to TMZ and next thing you know I end up getting served or whatnot my attorney calls me also and says they go down turn yourself in you know it's a federal assault charge yeah that's a federal assault yes yeah and that was it and again it was all over money it was a drawn-out case supposed to have been beat and it turned to that over a BB gun but a guy and he said it was an assault so I always he trying to get from you he got nine grand and it was supposed to when he filed the civil suit a couple months into this the criminal charges are supposed to be dropped at that point because prosecutor and everybody knew that it was all about money so they were gonna drop the criminal charge uh-huh they never did and it goes back in Youngstown you know I was out in the public eye and some of the people with a they had it out they had they have for people to understand how big star you are in Youngstown I mean I remember at the time I remember reading stories seeing news clip young sounds not a big place and other than Ray boom-boom Mancini is not a whole lot of like really famous people especially fighters had come out of Youngstown but you were a fucking giant celebrity in that town yeah and that was kind of my my bad on that that's where I take the default well it's probably hard for you to recognize you're not even 30 years old yeah all this shit is going on yeah it's true and I'm not looking for that as an excuse you know when I say it but it is true I looked I looked at myself as everybody else right I think that was the issue you hadn't recognized yet that you had some weird place where you have to watch what you're doing I felt like if I go to the bar and somebody goes boy Kelly Powell's been here three days he's a lush my argument was I got every right to be here just like you do matter of fact I have more of a right you know I'm retired I've got my money put away you're probably drinking you're you know weekly pay away that was my mind thought process thought process of that and it was probably wasn't right you know because it comes down to is you are a big fish in a little pond and it's a small city yeah I think that by being out there I brought a lot on myself because of that it is what it is unfortunately as an athlete you you can't do that and so that happened over a period of time and the word got around and a lot of anger you know yes I'm jealous I'm angry some who just didn't like me also just so much fun for them to gossip yeah exactly because what else is really not beating up Youngstown I loved it it made me who I am but if you really look up Youngstown areas not during a lot to talk about besides the fact that we do put out the most NFL players the per capita really oh absolutely Youngstown does why is that I don't know his averages there's some some badass news from from Youngstown and it is I don't know why I mean even the boxing part of it if you truly break down the five world champs from such a small city in 36 years as it came out who are the other world champs besides red boom Mancini area royal actually held the title in the same weight class around the same exact time that Massey and he did had Jeff Lampkin Greg Richardson and then you had a handful other guys like rollin Cummings and fighters out there that were making noise out of Youngstown a guy Ken Signorini who fought Jabez and Camacho out of Youngstown but being at being at being there like that it brought a lot of attention and people who wanted wanted you know and there was a lot of angry people was it weird growing up there and then becoming a famous guy there yeah it is because again you know you don't people tell you a kid would you get to that level when you win the World title shit's gonna change man and you're going yeah yeah yeah okay you think you know right like you're going yeah I got what you're saying and then it happens and you win it and it's so true when they say overnight like you're not you know more you know like you can't be yourself no more it's uh everything changes and it comes down to the person even though if you don't want to change and you like living your life the way you did two days ago fortunately you can't you know and it's it's hard and it's something that you gotta learn how to deal with yeah that wasn't my choice though you know what I mean by that my choice wasn't to go out and act like a jacqueline my choice was kind of just be me though right and you just did what you wanted to do I did and then it just became a big issue because you were a famous guy yes and another issue on top of that came to was where I could actually take the blame for this and I honestly can a lot of it came down to and everybody's different so I'm not I'm speaking for myself I trained my ass off when I trained you know I was a six seven hours a day type guy and and that's what got me to throw as many punches as I did around you know and I was in great shape for every fight I sacrificed a lot of things I gave up a lot you know I'm even starting from high school you know being in the amateurs and just turning pro right out of high school I missed a lot of things my mentality was when you know I had time I was gonna I was gonna live I was gonna live like my friends who were 19 20 21:24 and that was the process of it um I do believe though at a point especially after I retired that I got a little a little out of hand yeah absolutely you know and I'm not going to be the person to sit here and say that you know right it did I'm not naive enough to say that well you know better than anybody but the rumors were always that you were drinking a lot but and that was affecting your career it mailed to some point I don't think it did people say use the fact that Hopkins beat me and that was this that was the reason and that's why I retired so young and it wasn't it truly wasn't um maybe some of the stuff I was doing especially as I got older in between fights the drinking I think that that could have that may have heard a little bit I don't think it was enough to make any significant changes in my career to be honest with you but you know who knows with that if I didn't we'll never know again but I lived up and do I got anything they regret about it no do you still live in Youngstown yeah on the outside in the suburbs you know is it I mean it's got to be strange to have grown up there been a child there and then become an internationally famous world champion boxer and celebrity and still stay there yeah it's the world changes and you're still Kelly Pavlik and I think after I retired as for some of the mistakes have come to where I should have gotten out maybe come out here to California or go to it come on out Kelly yeah right yeah yeah if we're working on plenty of room yeah I just had that last night what what my manager uh mark he was talking about you doing out here can you say he's throwing around ideas also again we were talking about what we have talked about earlier but to fight coming back we talked about the Dancing with the Stars things that's some ideas he's looking into also sponsorships you know again mark is got a lot of connects he's about industry boxing is in an interesting place right now and I'm really was really bummed out that HBO canceled their boxing series I mean after how many years 40 43 something I mean they put on some of the all-time great classic fights and you know I think Jim Lampley one of the best commentators of all time I loved hearing Roy Jones jr. do it and Andre Ward and you know I just Max Kellerman was amazing I just can't believe that it's over I mean I don't know I guess it wasn't profitable for them or they just decided to get out of the business I really don't understand it I don't believe that it's going to be gone for long from HBO yeah some reason I think you noticed Lampley still has the fight game doesn't air and her doing that I heard rumors of maybe Roy Jones taking it over or buying it out or somebody buying yeah the big issue I think we're not what happens into the HBO and Showtime is doing very well right now yes I don't know right yeah and I'm not sure if they'll ever fall into the situation that HBO did but you have these apps coming out now ESPN plus does own D is the end and again like what they just had that signing what Canelo how big that was the richest athlete you know the biggest college 650 million dollars or something look I thought it was 365 and I was like sure Canelo's how much money something it was three hundred sixty-five million but he there's also per you know incentives and everything else opens that so 365 yeah and there's a six in there that's a lot of fucking money yes it is for I think 11 fights or whatever it was crazy and so again that that's where these people are coming to this ESPN plastic they could watch these fights now yeah on these for $7.99 $9.99 the zone has a OC or MMA fight bar I think it's pellet or fights whatever it is nice that ESPN is putting on a lot of fights now exactly and they also now have a deal with the UFC so in to 2019 now the first UFC event is going to be January 19th which is TJ Dillashaw versus Henry cejudo for the flyweight title and they're they're really putting on some great fights on ESPN it's just exciting just to see MMA being recognized by ESPN but it's exciting to see ESPN put like low mischenko fights on exactly because he's peein used to be kind of more so the prospect ya know to Friday Night Fights where D up-and-coming guy and they were putting out on and that was great for the prospects I think they need to actually keep doing that maybe on a different night but now they're putting the loan with janko's and they're putting their world-class fighters on Terrence Crawford's last fight on the SP I believe it was you know that's awesome that's awesome yeah so that and that app that ESPN plus like I'm saying so there's more accessibility to that and people would rather pay that then ordered a 69 or $89 pay-per-view fuck right seven bucks a month is nice it is yeah I mean with the UFC the UFC has UFC fight pass and you know they have events just constantly yeah same sort of deal and that's great for that it is because it's easier route you know outlet for it yeah you can keep watch on your phone on on a train it's like the world is changing and now also I love the fact you could stream it from your phone right to your television if you got a smart TV yeah exactly yeah you know I was even thinking about that at my gym because I know how it is with business and ordering pay-per-view fights mm-hmm there was actually a funny story about that Youngstown with that too where everybody thought it was my fault but uh yeah you could get that I could have 40 people there on a big fight night UFC Fight Night or a boxing fight night and I could just put that phone right up to the smart TV and we could watch it on there instead of pain don't say this don't say this right now they're gonna come get you oh yeah you're not gonna do that this is hypothetical this will never happen you're not gonna do that right well the UFC's gone after people in the past for illegally streaming things and then showing them on television oh well I thought if you had the app for be honest I think it's shown it on in a business because I know what I was talking about earlier what the Youngstown thing that happened it was kind of funny was they were getting the fights their pay-per-view fights and they were some of the businesses were illegally getting it and they all got fined you know they was going around and people were actually coming to me like I had something to do with it they were like I can't believe you do that you should have to pay us like $3,000 for to find out we got yeah and I'm going you yes I I start giggling I'm going last thing my mind was was I was worried about was who was ordering fights in Youngstown yeah when I'm here and you know Atlantic City or Vegas right now fighting getting ready trying to make weight and doing the interviews and the press conference and everything else what kind of asshole says that you should have yeah they kind of came out and won actually my brother was doing a going to get ads for the program from places and her like I'm not I'm not putting ad and he cost me $3,000 you know no you cost you yeah you fucking pirate aye aye Maties and I'm sure it I'm not just using that with with the Youngstown that would probably would have happened any word yes ball small area so well you know illegal streaming if they don't do something about it man it would run rampant I just don't know what the thing to do that's correct is you know I've seen some outrageous fines I don't know you know and as you as we just have what happened earlier we don't know what's what's legal what's not either anymore with all the different internet stuff and apps that you have and with the Smarties with TVs yeah yeah I mean or you know can you stream it on your phone and have a bunch of people look over your shoulder yeah how does that work for if you have a smart TV yeah if you have it on your phone and then like 20 of your friends come over and they're behind you yeah and you say hey man everybody give me a dollar yeah you get in trouble for that how does that work or that could be a great idea not the worst idea but yeah how does that work because with Apple TV anything you're watching you can watch a YouTube video and you just stream it to that TV with a you know a quick swipe and a press BAM yeah yeah I think the move for them is to make it easily accessible like WWE was the first one to figure that out right they they've figured out how to they you get like a monthly subscription and you get to watch all the events and then the UFC did that with fight pass and ESPN Plus doing this and he knows how to make the money yeah we could all see sure you know I think what's also great as somebody's inside station you know local stations and inside putting these fights on also like they used to do back in the day you know the ABC fight yeah and it was a sport yeah yeah oh that's y'all do not again you know why wouldn't us it's great for the sport and you know that's how you get people involved back in it you know it's almost like almost every other generation or every other decade there's that group of fighters that come out you know you like ali-frazier guys like that then you had like the Tyson Holyfield retic beau but also at that time it was easy and it was accessible to to watch all the time mm-hmm yeah now you know it's not even the apps which is I think it's great you get a lot of guys in their 40s and 50s who don't want to have to watch an app on TV so I think if they start bringing back just a little more variety of shows or something well it seems like especially with boxing right now the talent level is extremely high I mean it is with MMA as well but I mean with boxing it seems to be on an upswing and it also seems like people are really interested in some of these big rivalries like triple G and Canelo that was two amazing fights I thought the first one was a robbery I thought that triple G won the first one but they don't fight again really yeah why's that because when you get a guy that hits as hard as triple G does and you get a guy that's as good as Canelo you know and an earner even though they're not getting dropped and they're not getting knocked out that some type of fights take a lot out of you they really do and they shirt a lot in those two fights and we don't know even right now if the next fight or two fight after that can also start showing somebody effects from those first two fights you think so yeah you get a guy that hits two guys I hit that hard and earn they're fighting like that eventually it does drain you a little bit and that will catch up I think in third fight will shorten a career of Canelo I'm not gonna say triple G because triple G is my age now and I I have a feeling that his might be getting short here pretty soon anyways just due to age but Canelo I mean that that's those are brutal fights they were brutal fights did you think that some people thought that triple G won the second fight as well I thought it was much closer fight than the first fight but did you think that Canelo or triple G I think Canelo showed some improvement but it's also possible the triple G might have slowed down a little bit I think so you know the first fight I had at nine three four triple G that's how it sounds about right yeah and I gave the first three rounds to Canelo and then I had every round after for a triple G this fight I thought Canelo one close fight and if you gave it to triple G I wouldn't have screamed we're all right you know I think Teddy was saying then he thought that triple G one but I felt like well it's a pretty close fight pretty close fight but certainly Canelo showed much improvement he did and he fought a better fight the first half of the fight I gave up a lot of mouths because I thought he controlled the fight with two body shots and everybody thought triple G was controlling with the jab but the reason why triple G wasn't using his size and strength was because it was using his jab was because of the body shots that canola was landing I mean they were brutal and I just thought Canelo dictated the pace of those first couple of rounds I thought he won enough of the early rounds and obviously triple G one delay the second most of the second half of the fight but I thought it was a little too late you know that I had Canelo up by a round or two yeah it's it's just what those are those are two fighters that really sort of epitomize what people like to see when they like to see like these classic rivalries right like a guy like triple G who's just forward pressure constant throwing bombs knockout puncher a guy like Canelo who's just one of those classic Mexican fighters as incredible heart wants to fight the best of the best like really like really takes it in the first fight yeah yeah stay on the ropes with triple G and let him let him use that power to beat you organs then yeah one of those fights you know I'm not one to talk I kind of like getting in and getting involved myself with guys especially like with Miranda who I personally believe hit hard in triple G really but yeah and I was the guy in ER but that was my strategy as were Canelo I was I really wasn't a great strategy you know I didn't lay on the ropes and let Miranda do you think he just didn't know what to expect until he was in there with triple G it could have been because everything changes like I think Mike Tyson said it you know but he's got a game plan until they get hit I he might he got touched I said even with the tension and that Mayweather fighting the whole brain mighty just started going a thousand miles an hour trying to figure out mm-hmm okay like this ain't gonna probably work tonight with this guy cuz he's a lot stronger than I expected and he was just trying to maybe tire him out the only issue is now you're when you're on the ropes like that and you're getting hit by a guy that hits that hard and adults in the elbow in the forearms and and to the body and then you're tightening up and you're tensing up really hard you're cutting the oxygen off to the blood it tires you out quicker and it wears you down you know more than what he was doing in the middle of the Ring bye pomp chaton and and counterpunching and he could have dictated how fast he wanted you know how much you wanted to punch how hard he wanted to punch yeah we certainly made some big improvements in that second fight yeah do you um you you really don't want to see them fight a third time I truly don't I mean if it happens I'm gonna watch it you know but they're gonna fight right I mean Cannell is obviously gonna fight some people and triple G's obviously gonna continue fighting you know and again I don't know how long triple G's gonna fight because as you mentioned and I agree with you I think he's starting to his age is showing up a little bit with him Wow I mean he he got avoided by a lot of people and we you know when he had a pay-per-view a couple years back that only got a hundred and fifty thousand buys and I remember thinking that is a damn shame it is it's a damn shame that people don't realize that this is absolutely one of the best fighters ever I was surprised by that too because I think he's a lot more popular than what those numbers show I didn't get it I don't understand I mean I don't maybe it's because they didn't think the fight was competitive maybe I mean I don't know what it was but it just it seemed like I I just think personally myself there's a lot of fights out there for Canelo he just went up to 168 yeah I'm not a big fan of that you know think he's too small for saying I do especially if you get him with the right fighter I truly do believe that you know everybody how tall is easy 510 yeah five-nine five-ten but you know what boxing it over like football when you see the height you always gotta take an inch inch and a half off to so oh do they live yeah I mean list of six three I'm right under six to abut like much so it's got like the football program in our school right right but um Canelo I think that there's guys out there staying at sixty eight it's kind of dangerous I think he's right now talented enough to keep good fights out there yeah but it's a little dangerous in my opinion I think it 68 could cause problems for him you got even the guys like zurdo Benavidez mm-hmm those are dangerous fights just them two guys right there I would have to take not so much overall skill wise just sighs and and being at that weight and you know they're you got guys coming down like bball mm-hmm from 175 to 168 I think that his better days are gonna be at 160 you know I think he does he have a hard time making 60 or do you just have an opportunity to fight 60 80 Tiger I think it's the trophies yeah you know and I don't blame him for that either he had the right fight to go up to 168 so get another weight division under his belt yeah he was tuned in that dude up I think w-what three now he's a three weight class champ yeah and so that looks good on paper when you retire ya know it does I would have done it if I could have you know if there was the right fights out there but when he fought Mayweather Mayweather made him cut down to what 52 was it something like I think they either had a catchweight around that you know that fight was to me what was a good learning experience for him to be in there with a guy was just slick as Floyd is but also a good learning experience he you're not supposed to suck that much weight out of your body just he didn't have the fire no even though you have 24 hours or however long it is to try to rehydrate that's never enough time to recoup yeah this night so your your thing is you're just hoping your opponent's going through the same thing that you are you know that's what it comes down to what I do like about boxing that is missing in MMA is more weight classes I really think that and that's one of the things that people have a problem with in boxing they think there's too many weight classes I don't agree with that I think if anything there's too many world champions I think it's ridiculous that in any organization that one guy could be a WBC world champion the other guy could be a w-a there's an IBF WBO I mean like that's crazy it's crazy to have that many world champions it should be a world champion but how do you decide what organization is real sanctioning body do all you just need one sanctioning body yeah I don't know how you would do that either because it's all money they're also corrupt yeah it's all money it's hard to do that I I see your point on that a little bit and then I also look at like you got so many guys that are so good yeah and there's a boxing is a short window so like how long can you stay on the feet until you finally get that chance to fight the top guys top dog and anything can happen in boxing - you know I kind of like I may be knocking down a three but I think when you have the different weight classes now you got four people just say one person has each belt you got four world champs now you're looking at these four guys and you can start taking these prospects and start saying this would be an interesting fight with this guy and this guy and then I do believe that they should make make happen one undisputed champ yeah I believe so - okay that should happen in every weight class yep they should have a fight off for a box off and the four champions or you know you may be dead that way keep the prospects in line and have the four champions fight off did you know who is the undisputed champion and then your prospects get your shot you know it just seems weird to have more than one world champion you're either the world champ it's like how many guys won the Super Bowl this year how many teams won one it should be one you can't have multiple world champ like when Anthony Joshua was walking around as a heavyweight champion but also Deontay Wilder is walking around as a heavyweight champion like what what is this is are you the heavyweight champion or you the champion of the new organization that falls into like what kind of again what we were talking about earlier with Jermaine Taylor thing when he vacated abouts okay yeah in my mind you won the unified to fire or Universal recognizable the ring the ring middleweight title because where does the lineal begin when does it not and I had to ring title alright so usually in most cases the ring title was undisputed or lineal champ so in other words the champ oh that way class right you know it's something but for the most part you know who is the champion of a weight class ring magazine's title is almost as valuable as anybody this is s1 and that's the one that I really showcase when I show people my nice my case you know what's so classic to would like the the stripes and the love I think Rock you've really did a lot for that boat - yeah yeah yeah yeah well it's a classy looking belt you know and everybody else got the big ones with the leather and the strap like the Ring Magazine is a nice one yep I wanted the belts you know I didn't want to pay to sanction fees for all forward belts but I wanted to still wanted to IBF and WBA and you know to put in a trophy case but fortunately laden fights fell through when you were coming up when you were a kid and you were watching boxing we go Hagler fan I was a Hagler fan but you know I said another one that's actually were with me even having guys like Mancini and arroyo from Youngstown and guys like that had never really had this one person that I was like or a poster in my bedroom you know like the D lawyer or something you never had one guy that like you emulated or you were really low emulated everybody and I think that's what helped me get this far that doing my career I mean even when I was 16 I can watch an annual spar and see him do something cool and hit a guy and I'm like damn you know I'm gonna try that that actually might work I followed it and I was just a big fan of the sport overall of course I had guys that like like gaudy because of his style coming up and De La Hoya Sugar Ray Leonard in my opinion is probably the one of the best fighters pound for pound of all time oh yeah and it's arguable I mean if somebody says Mayweather I'm not gonna he's one of the best for sure yeah I'm not gonna say you're stupid for having a number one it's a great debate but yeah so I followed it more as a fan you know and I watched and I took from this person I took from that person we have as I mentioned we had some prospects and the amateurs coming up to that training the same gym and that will kind of copy their a style you know coming up so I was always trying to keep learning like I even doing and working out now I find different things that work you know what don't work and that's what I did as far as box and I just watch guys a hair Nair I will copy for like two days De La Hoya style you know he beauty with the hands up and picking them off with the hands I go in sparring I didn't try it in a fight I did it in Sporn and I will copy his style a little bit to see how it works or how I could add it to my arsenal so yeah I was just asking about Hagler because he's sort of the quintessential middleweight champion you know like a few guys that you look back in the day and you look at you know we're just a conic middleweight champion your guys in your late 40s and 50s okay they'll argue with you that he was the best middleweight of all time he certainly was one of them yeah and you have you'll have your guys that you know have Hopkins that's what I'm saying like even a heavyweight you got your olders Oh Joe all right Muhammad Ali was the best did you have your guys in early 40s tell you that too Mike Tyson so it's kind of like whoever grew up on that me personally you got to get past that because again that becomes biased and and everybody's gonna kind of go with what they grew up with there was a lot of greats sure well people sleep on Lennox Lewis you know when you talk about the greats all-time great heavyweight boxers like how the fuck do you not include Lennox Lewis Asajj the size the power yeah how do you not put Evander Holyfield you do you know two guys that beat Tyson the crazy yeah Riddick Bowe yeah I mean way smaller it was a hell of a narrow heavyweights crazy crazy era yeah the 90's right those are ones when you say heavyweight division those were two fighters you know but it's how long ago was that now a long time yeah some years and so it don't come around enough well what I'm hoping is more emerging talent in the heavyweight division will sort of take a little bit of this spotlight that you're seeing now that's going on fury and wilder and Joshua and I'd like to sin you know and a little bit of Ortiz I like to see more guys get in the mix there and have it be like it used to be back then where there are a bunch of like really exciting contenders yeah you look forward to these big fights because right now there's like four guys five six guys at most that are gonna fight each other exactly and you know hopefully what it does is it gets these other bigger bigger guys he's athletic athletes and and skilled athletes and hopefully it brings him into the boxing again he's uh did I remember did I remember is David to of making a comeback I hope not seriously how old is he gotta be mid 40s dude he was 46 he's not did I make that up that he's making a comeback I'm looking he was a fucking you know unfortunately in the heavyweight division he probably could get away with that I 46 I might be able to he was a goddamn monster yeah well he was short he was he was a hard guy to fight he was one of them guys that low to the ground thick big legs no neck brutal power yeah it left hook yeah yeah he's one of the guys you didn't want to fight even if you were Lennox Lewis his height remember when he knocked out John Ruiz yeah brutal yeah I know he was an animal man and he could take a shot too remember when he fought Ike ABEO Buchi who was the only guy to go the distance with a bamboo Qi I was another pig he was a scary motherfucker yeah and what did he went to jail for like sexual assault or something crazy like that he was in jail for a long time we were just talking about another guy to kind of mind me of them Samuel Peters another uh ya know neck nice thick yeah he was my actually I trained with him a little bit out top Rank's Jim were fighting he was actually a really cool guy you know and he was a big fan of mine too so it was kind of neat to be able to share it out with him and you know talk with him before we started training that's cool that's cool baya Buchi uh I think I want to say that he's getting out soon he was in jail for a long time and apparently there was some article that I read couple of years back that he was planning on making a comeback when he gets released but again he's deep into his 40s as well yeah and it's hard to make it come back and no matter if it's heavyweight or not at that level you know after being out I tell people all the time what's even young kids they're 21 and 22 when sometimes these promoters freezed her contract or there's a dispute going on and they set out two years sometimes they may not ever come back fully from that yeah you know what I mean it's true especially at that high of a level you know in boxing did Mikey Garcia have a contract that he did yeah and I was concerned about that when he came back you know I was I was concerned about how much damage that time off could have done how long was his contract ago I think it was two years he didn't file over ten years for a top-level fighter like him that's a disaster it is and you know but Mikey on the other hand he's a genius in the ring and he just he has that going for him you No and he also could fight yeah you know he's been doing it since he was so young and being in a family I think the cake came out the room with boxing gloves on so there's so many good fights to be made right now it's just it's a real exciting time it's just a really really exciting time which is and you know the reason why I'm bummed out that HBO got out of the game I'll I would like to see HBO come back I mean do you notice talks of it and I think would be great for the sport again if it came back as big as it did now don't get me wrong towards the end it was kind of hard to watch with some of the fights they had on in my opinion you know you just weren't interesting they weren't big fights you know and do you think that was a funding thing like they didn't have enough of a budget that or I think they knew longer that it was there were on the way out yeah and saved the money you know I don't know how many subscriptions they lost from that I don't know if it hurt or what but I asked why I say after keeping the fight game open and they're showing that I see you coming back especially a Showtime stays with the boxing and doing as soon as they are in a box office with the numbers I see HBO I think it would have to come back well I think with things like Netflix and Amazon Prime they're they're making these television shows now that are so popular that it's and they there's such high budget but you get things like Game of Thrones cost so much money to make but so many people watch it I think they're concentrating on those kind of things because they're so profitable and I don't think it's the network's anymore they got worried about shutting down too with all these other Zulu and Amazon and Netflix being out you know I think somebody eventually so many cable companies are gonna have to worry yeah no I'm sure yeah it seems like you know it's we're entering into a new era of entertainment yeah technology and the spin of it you know again these apps people I think that ESPN Plus had over seven knowing some subscribers when it came out because of the boxing and everything else and yeah dad does own does the use or you know fights on there and and boxing so you're gonna have these coming out and people are gonna get into it and it's changing its changing a lot well they're doing Bellator fights they're doing a lot of fights on the zone right yeah it's um it's very exciting time have you thought about you you were saying talking a little bit about commentary have you thought about doing commentary I have have you ever done any of it no no no but I would like to you know honestly I would uh I not knocking anybody I may not be the best talker in the world either but I listen to some of the guys on there and I'm like I think I could do that you know listen I know you could do it you definitely do it but it's to me it adds a certain element when a real world-class fighter is breaking down situation because you're getting to see it from their perspective of how they would approach it in it's not just a guy who's a boxing experts a guy who did it who did it yeah a guy who was a world champion like Andre Ward like when Andre Ward's on I fucking love that guy as a commentator yeah Holly is good to paulie's Andre and Pauly's is Malin ah she's one of my favorites he's excellent damn that motherfucker talks good yeah smartest shit man he is he saw in all aspects of life you know he's doing well for himself and just the right things so probably these he's a great person I like him he's a good buddy of mine and yeah it is you know I think when the fans like to watch and see you know you want to hear from the historian or the guy that's the other commentator who just knows the sport men who could speak well they like care and their side of it yes but I think at some certain times during a fight they like to hear from the fighter like hey what the hell's going through that guy is mine he just got smashed you know with that right hand or get hit with a good body shot why does this keep happening again why is why is he doing this with what the fighter thinks should be set in a corner you know during between rounds so I think it's important to have a guy that's been there done it as a commentator Andre Ward is another interesting guy because he's also young and also world champion undefeated and just decided you know what I'm good see yeah he is he is right now actually it's funny and I have to talk about it a little bit we were I was covering a fight to Loma chenko for draws a fight and he comes up to me and I don't know where and he's like hey like damn you getting big and he's smiling he shakes my hand and he walks down to you know covered a fight and I'm sitting there and looking watching the fights and then I'm getting ready to head out after that you know the fights about over and he comes walking up and he goes hey if he offered you ten million dollars would you make a comeback I'm like I couldn't find a reason why I wouldn't I don't know and he was he smile and he walked away and I was going I'm scratching my head I'm going wonder why you know why he would ask me a question like that yeah I seen recently that he's looking at certain fighters as a possible comeback oh so he's thinking about doing it again yeah yeah is that hitch it says well she gee I just don't think you're ever gonna find anything that's gonna recreate the high so if like when you knocked out Jermaine Taylor how the fuck could you recreate that high you can't okay that combination when you pinned him in the corner and put him away and then you walk away and you realize that you won holy shit and that don't even kick in that's all going 100 miles an hour you're up on that I see the pictures all the time pull that up with the hands in the air and I see all the people and you know that's just it was so fast you know it took me a while before I could I even though I walked out of my house and I had him up you know on the side is before I still live with my parents at the time and I did - I had a puppet at the house and I have you leaving to go to the gym or something I look over at the belts and I'm like yeah oh you know what those are mine but it never really kicked into like a little while later like yeah like that I did that that I'm the world champion not only I got one but I got three of them when you were lying in bed that night you probably had to be gone when I in a fucking dream that's what it felt like it is what a fight this was goddamn this was a fight this was one of my all-time favorite middleweight championship fights for sure and Jermaine Taylor man he was a bad motherfucker he was and again you know a lot of people talked about the handful of ice before that and a tough you know with smaller guys but he was a bronze medalist who beat you know demand Bernard Hopkins there it is tomb the combination when you put him away to fucking phenomenal man phenomenal this right here what did you walk out that was all bore I just put my hands up yep fuck man I mean what that feeling they try to describe that like what is going through your head everything possible for him not to get back up I know it sounds funny when people say that but that's the truth you know my big thing was if I got somebody hurt get them out because boxing is dangerous right you know and anything could happen if they can get back up they have a chance that knocking you out or beating you so but when it was over like what does that feel like it's it's hard to explain it really is you're just you're you're on cloud nine you just nothing I could bring you down you know you're you're you went from being a breezes through the roof to be in a world champion to being a huge superstar in boxing yeah and it's hard to grasp at once and it takes time and unfortunately sometimes it you get it when it's too late you know what I mean you really grasp it and it's just one of the things that's you know even I was talking with guy last night and he brought up he was originally from South Korea he was talking about he goes there all the time big business guy and he says uh they actually study my fight down or something on how you could get knocked down this is more of you know in your field of it up your alley how you get knocked down on what gets a guy to get back up and recover the recovery the endurance to pretty much have your brains rattle but be able to come back that strong Browns later and knock somebody out you know and for me to simple answer is you know of course training hard yeah making sure I'm in shape but I guess what he's trying to figure out is like what's what's the brain wave is that what's the drive that gets you to do that what is the endurance of the muscles and you know that's pretty deep thinking a little pest I think there's a lot there there's a lot and there's no one first of all every combination that you get hit with is different you know some some combinations you're just not gonna get up from and some of them you you're on the border can you get up can you not get up how bad do you want it maybe think about your daughter maybe think about your mom yeah and you just get this burst of adrenaline and you like fuck this I'm getting up and the referee gives you the count you just fight smart keep your hands up and keep moving the next thing you know that cardio kicks in and then you're back like that Tyson Fury and that's that's the way I looked at it that's like the simple way of looking at it Tyson Fury against wilder by all rights that fight should have been done he lands that right hand and then that left hook and you see Tyson fewer go down like he got hit in the head with an asteroid yeah boom he's just flat on his back you're like holy shit he knocked him out in the 12th round and then everybody thought he did the Undertaker always sat up I seen all alike memes and gifts of him sitting up and like they showed you Undertaker doing it with that right there I think a little different from mine I personally believe that he wasn't hurt that bad really I believe that he got dropped and I was legit but he was laying there taking the eight nine seconds you know to recover and he got up I don't think he was out because there's no real way to be out that cold I don't get up and get up and the hand of Jesus yeah Jesus came down upon him man let's watch that knockdown pull up that knockdown yeah I feel like that was one of the most fucking good as far as my talking about that as far as like what's going through your head it's crazy because when I got knocked down it was more of an equilibrium shot but I could hear my legs were gone but I could hear certain people in the stands and I knew what was going on and the first thing that was in my head was and you worked way too hard to go out like this so it is that drive you know here it is right here what's crazy is that wilder look at this boom I mean come on man this dude's fucking hurt he's fucking hurt something happened Jesus came down upon him that's why it's that's why I was saying I think I don't know maybe he was hurt I mean he went down he went down pretty bad he went talking credible and then he's a to recover yeah and the fact that he's not the best in shape guy either you don't think so no I mean we kept movin for 12 fucking right yeah he did do that but to be able to get up that quick well how is he not the best in shape guy I mean 206 but no that's a fucking crazy well this is a great shape for for a heavyweight mm-hmm you could put it that way I see what you're saying yeah well no heavyweight is ever gonna be in the same kind of shape that say oh yeah that's our weights gonna be in just because you're carrying around so much body weight but I was saying in front of the point of getting up that quick yeah after being dropped and not to be stumbly and fallen over it's true I mean he just came back and that's why I'm thinking more so like yeah he got hurt and I'm probably wrong on this but I'm saying like yeah he got hurt and he's Lana and he's going shit let's watch it here here comes that fucking missile and then this one I mean come on son timber that's that is some crazy shit they said he hit his head but he did not I love not yeah if people say he is but his head bounced off the mat and never bounced off that mat yeah I'm he kept his head up as he was going back which lets you know that he was conscious but doom and bah boom I mean he got fucking rocked but what she would have had an overview because you could tell by the eyes also right right whether or not the rolled back yeah or an outside cardio is significant if you're in great cardio shape you recover quicker you know there's there's a bunch of different factors in why you recover quicker your mindset has to play a factor right how bad you want it that's what I'm sayin no doubt he was hurt from the punch and he went down I'm just thinking for that period of time was he laying or also saying I'm gonna take the full eight nine to get up or like use I did a did it hand come down suction upon him and rose from the dead he's just a tough motherfucker man and a good guy too super fucking smart guy funny yeah I mean what a character and now when you were training and you were doing your strength and conditioning did you would you like an old-school method guy or did you use heart rate monitors and all the new school methods no I was I like the functional strength training I did a lot of that with what kind of stuff I took a sledgehammer an entire bushing Matt Brown has a great he's got a put his Matt's company give his company a plug I think it's a immortal something strength and conditioning but he's got a great bunch of he's got sledgehammers but with a rounded head so you don't have to fucking swinging around and a Mortal Kombat equipped the Mortal Kombat equipment he's got a great sled - these stack weights on and he left a lot of that stuff out there these grim yeah the war wagon a lot of different grip strength apparatus things like balls you do chin-ups for this those balls in the far left you do chin-ups gripping those things it's got some great shit slips dips push and push in our trucks and what else did we get into it I will go to this place called Ironman warehouse and it was kind of a nice setup their children and it was more for like the gym owner I love him to death and he's crazy he truly is and he's about 48 now and he could still Rodney Rowe's what's a matter of fact that my role title fight against Taylor at the boardwalk everybody kept talking about it was like 4,000 people talking about this crazy guy running on a beach what I think that log was like 120 pounds just running I wanna stop yeah real Christian guy you know into it and he does all right with a log of him he was all the peace races with that phenomenal shape well you had a place that in a lot of it was the functional strength training you know I do pull-ups on fire hoses and for the gripping and everything else that that's why I like doing that was you know look I wasn't building muscle but I was getting strongest help and I was getting also a lot of cardio work involved in that but I'm for the most part it was the the shrine areas yeah right a log on sir here he is this motherfucker running around with a log that can't be good for your knees uh-huh I wonder how he's walking right now like right now I see guys do screws screw screwy shit like that I go okay you could do that right now but let me see what you look like in six months let me call you back are you doing it for a long time I don't know though how he does it but uh that's so much weight on your joints to be running with a hundred and twenty pound log on your shoulders he's a freakin nature I mean do that what does that show the Ninja Warrior or whatever you know I truly believe that he could go into that and do very well net I mean he had at the Iron Man warehouse they had the little balls and he swings from each one up there he takes two 45 pound plates he throws them up in the air and he catches them back coming down just crazy things like that and that's where I went to training after to Miranda fight I was doing what I should on my own for the Miranda fight and then after the Miranda he had told me he goes how I got this place down here come down try it out and I was doing all that crazy stuff man and it worked again it was strong the only thing that I wish I could have went back with that now as time goes on and I'm training some athletes at my gym is we have this machine called a vertex piece of equipment and it's amazing I mean it truly as you could emulate more so with than you can with the bands what you're doing if you're a football player you know what does come off vertebra max if you find that it's an amazing like for rust right there for wrestlers back is it these bands like the last elastic blends but as okay as no Dersch the straps okay with the rubber band you your tension is usually gone at the beginning and then you get to get to a certain point to get as where this has resistance all the way through oh there's a pulley system yeah and you could set the tension on it on the back part you could pull out and make it a little harder but it's unbelievable boy so when you go back down there's tension all the way through from beginning to end oh yes twitch muscle and a lot of wrestlers are using it oh I like that so I wish I had that kind of law adding that in with the functional strength training could have definitely made me a lot better than I think it could for a lot of athletes that seems like you do everything with that thing yep that's amazing what they had the Raptor also which is very good it's the same concept as that but you put it up on the fence and you could run out farther and do different things on also with that thing could you do like shoulder exercises and stuff as well you just have to prop it up I've been screwing around with it at my gym and I found ways to do flies really on putting a little arm balance boards I put that down on it and now you get two straps where you can do flies with it yeah shoulder exercise core you know especially with the Raptor you could walk out with that and what is the Raptor it goes on the wall you could it's more for like travel see if you find that thing so you could put it on the fence at a baseball field in a swing you can even do a golf date is right there yeah verda max Raptor wow look at golf the golf swing and can you adjust the tension yes justice on the back so you'll pull it they have little black spots that I tell you you know it goes up to three three spots so that seems like that would be great for punching power as well it is and the thing is you don't want too much tension with that right I try to explain I got some people that work with guys that might gym on it and they train them more like an endurance thing and I tell them you're defeating the purpose you know there's a place in time for strength and endurance especially a boxer guys running in the morning he's sitting pads at the gym yeah I really think that should focus on the explosion don't go to you're tired I want every rep every movement to have explosions broad Jones jr. yeah yeah that's amazing so you just it's just enough resistance so that everything that you do just gets if you put too much resistance then you're not gonna be able to really fire off the fast twitch right right right now the only thing I see also that could hurt people is they do the whole workout with that now what happens you eventually get tired and fatigued and then I mean all your motion is slow so now you're going to habit of that you know I like to work I'm on it for about 15-20 minutes take them off and then have them do the same exercises with it after but no resistance and then just keep it that day just with the the fast twitch muscle to small muscle training and then the next day we go into strength you know or endurance so are you training guys I'm right now this gym and I have a yeah I have one box was the name your gym my gym is called my mi I am so we had changed yeah because I've already have my gym my gym yeah that's me Jim yeah me Jim it's me Jim come on down to be Jim let's banish my yeah or at a time ya know we got I'm doing out with them right now it's fun working with their strength and conditioning you know I am also going to be doing a boxing gym at the end of the summer hopefully in the ground it's going to happen it's just a matter of time now when you were training and you were fighting did you have a specific schedule of when you would do strengthen conditioning and how many days a week you would run how many days a week you would do like physical exercises yeah you know and that's another thing you all as I have said earlier to you always keep learning you know ever I wasn't it worked for me for what I did when I was fighting and I would totally have changed it now knowing the stuff that I know and you know being involved in it researching and you know we used to run Monday Tuesday Wednesday three miles and then think Thursday off and then Friday and Saturday and then we do on top of that I would go to do my strength and conditioning training and now we got the boxing gym that's a lot yeah that's a lot on the body too and yeah you know eyes were like when I went to California we did Monday Wednesday Friday running and it was only two and a half three miles and then those days in between we did the strength and conditioning training so I didn't have a preference on that I didn't care the only thing I did say is I didn't want to run early in the morning why is that because my by didn't get going I wasn't one of those guys in the morning and it happens to people you know like if I wasn't ran too early I would end up being a feeling like shit the rest of the day really yeah you know I like just dragon ass as well when I wasn't ran at like 9:30 in the morning I got my best running I killed it and then I felt great the rest of the day what how much sleep would you make sure you had that was a tough one I got about seven to eight hours yeah they say you need eight and you really should try to get 10 your professional athlete I took my Sundays off and I rested all day Sunday and I kind of ate you know a good amount of carbs and kind of what I wanted to long on Sundays you know pending on where the weight was out and well far out we were from the fight but um I don't I really don't believe in the theory of you got to wake your guy up or in the morning and make him run I don't if I was training guys I want my guy to run out whatever I'm gonna get the best run out that's the time I want him to run he'll adapt and especially after he keeps fighting he'll adapt it's more mind over body but I think the gym is non-negotiable at 3 o'clock I like to Train and if I was training guys my Jamar's would be between 3 & 7 why do you like late-afternoon because it gets you closer to the fight night you know especially close to a fight I would like actually for my guys to train about 8 o'clock at night 9 o'clock you know if depending on what they have going on in a personal life so you have like a clock so your body has like a time that it knows it's gonna work yeah and I didn't do that what did you do I sparred at you know for 3 but if I'm talking about me being a trainer I would like that for my fighters so what you've learned from your career just apply it yeah the only thing I would really take from it would be the running in the morning you know if my guy wanted said hey coach I'd rather run after the gym tonight and I knew that that was gonna make a difference in a minute on his mouth okay run a night because I want him to get the best run possible you know that's most important so did you run for speed did you do sprints did you do long-distance running like with it what kind of running did you do I did do sprints we added I wish we could have done more but you know I was big with the steps too and we have stairs yeah Youngstown State University in Youngstown I've got one side that's pretty big is steep you know it goes up and I would do that probably about three times the camp for unbeliever you got to watch how many times you do that throughout of camp because it builds muscle especially running that high you know you know steps and then when you start cutting the weight and you got to get done it's going to be hard to lose that extra pound which could make a big difference come fight night so for a six eight week camp you would only run it three times three times yeah and then I had Sprint's on the hills and I did regular sprints because the regular Sprint's is firing a fast twitch muscle and it's also hitting a big muscle and it's building the legs and strength distance was important but still another big one to me is the pad work you know the training at the gym I'm not a big fan of bag work anybody hadn't have a good punching bag how come because you learn how to manipulate the bag and you know trick your trainer and everybody else I can go ahead a bag right now I probably do 10 rounds on it you know just because I know how hard to punch it's hard to tell us to worry when you're hitting pads I know how hard my guys punching and I'm giving him the combos in the numbers so he has no time to concentrate on what you want him to do and he's not throwing the punches that he wants right I mean so it's it's easier I mean it's harder than it in the bag I think that's a big part of the training you know that I would do with you guys and and it makes a big difference overall did you do like a lot of drills in terms in terms of like movement drills or movement drills with combinations like how did not not at home either you know I didn't when I trained in Youngstown no no I learned a lot of that you know when I went to California from Garcia yeah yeah so that was that one of the reasons why you were saying like man I was amazing I burn because you know I was cocky I don't know yeah so me after 12 years of being pros an awesome trainer yeah you know I was cocky what I'm like I got all these fights and I was you know great amateur what more can you show me and I went out there and I learned you know you can't be taught and taking nothing away from you know jack am I my trainer at home I mean that guy he got me ready though like if you're fighting I was in shape you know it was like a drill sergeant on that and you know another little thing on that what you're running you know cement I think now I would have my guys run on grass track you know it was boring I don't care if you're bored running you know you're gonna run around a track it's easier on the joints and less demand on the body but uh so overall I mean there's a lot that's why I like it that's why I like being evolved right now with the strength and conditioning gym cuz I'm working with people getting them healthy helping them out and eventually I could add a lot of this to my fighters you know yeah there's a long education when it comes to physical fitness the long education understanding how much is too much when's the right time to do things and that's one of the reasons why I was asking you like how did you decide if you were going to do three times over the course of a training camp you're going to run those stairs how did you decide that was that a strength coach that decided that no that was an because yes because I didn't want the muscle I knew it'd come God's Way Don yeah come time when you're starting to dry out yeah I'm gonna wish that you kind of didn't but I always was afraid in the back i you know ii guess in my my conditioning so i always wanted to be strong mm-hmm you know again that the stuff like that Verta max that wasn't out yet you know we had the bands and we do so many exercises on that i never researched much at that time either i was in great shape and i was strong as a mule but there was other things like being athletic I started eventually towards the end doing some cross training you said you're a big fan of that you know I absolutely am also I think becoming a great athlete overall there's nothing wrong with that and it's fun it breaks up the monotony of the same training regimen all the time do you remember when they didn't want you to lift weights they didn't want boxers to lift weights like before Mackay she'll stone before he worked with Michael Spinks when he when he moved up to heavy weight and fought Larry Holmes I mean remember people were saying like they don't want boxers to lift weights that it's gonna tighten you up and slow you down like that was that was the thought process behind it and then from him and then in particular Holyfield Holyfield went from cruiserweight to heavyweight and he put on a lot of mask that was Mackay chill stone - right yeah I mean that that just changed the game Jamie that's your guy but I don't want to make him have to keep searching he loves it they actually has if you could put it on Kelly pelvic workout workouts training we had a guy - which was the weight I did do weight lifting when I was fighting yeah but and I do agree what's the weight lifting and I don't agree with it I don't think you should go heavy with the weight lifting if you're going to get your strength I absolutely look how thin you are manly training slim bastard yeah putting on a training with rock at Rocky's or something like that that was go for Nia yeah there you go that's the second one yeah see the light weight yeah but we would do hundreds and hundreds of reps just endurance yeah burn just burning when you look at yourself without all the tattoos do you go huh you know that blank canvas look at those arms yeah but you look at those arms now you probably embarrassed those gigantic tree trunks you're packing now no yeah but those things kick ass those things fuck your head up anyway yeah I don't know if I have to snap on it now like I had then but um yeah so the way stuff like that I totally agree with because it is great for muscle endurance if you're going to get the strength I go back to the functional training for that I don't think a boxer or a combat it might be a little different with UFC got MMA fighters because of the rest of the wrestling and everything else and that will come down to having a somebody that really knows like I said you never stop learning in it but for me with my guys yeah endurance training like that that's great and you can even switch that in what some functional endurance training - you know one thing we used to at Ironman a standard get a heavy chain and arms locked out for the front delts and turn and turn it you know pretty intense - for a period of time so there's just a lot of things that you could add and I think you know everybody goes well you don't over train them and that's another thing like the body it's really hard to over train I mean you could go any way you could really over train as if you're not getting the right nutrition and you're not getting the right rest you know you know or if you push too hard you know give yourself enough recovery time and you push it too close to a fight yeah you see that's too long and you don't get enough rest period in between that's a big one the too long at camp you know Tim Sylvia or not Tim Sylvia Tim Kennedy who's a big who's for one time at one point I retired now but he was one of the top middleweight contenders who went through two camps in a row because one of his fights got cancelled rolled right into a sec camp and then fought and then had no endurance in his fight you could kind of tell that he was drained it just it was just too long it's like seven six or seven months of really being in camp something along those lines and probably in the in lines of somewhere did attrition this it could come down on a person like that is he getting enough you know the sources it's also cutting a lot of weight exactly you know you know dehydration everything else yeah this is hard I mean you got to find if you're going to bring somebody in I was fortunate my dad you know we kind of kicked ass on that we had a little sign you know broken down to a science and uh we made weight good and we were strong did you monitor your heart rate ever no never just felt how you felt yeah you know like these right down like how what different kinds of exercises you were doing workouts or did you play it you played it all yeah I still do that I still put that in my even weight liftin really yeah I feel like when you write down you limit yourself how so because if I get going I see guys all the time not knocking at everybody but I see them coming with a little notepad yeah and they have what they got and I see them go over and do literally only four sets on the bench and then they write down what they did and then they go over and do some dumbbells or same with the squats I feel you're limiting yourself I mean you didn't work that muscle to you know failure and you should it most of the time because if not that becomes maintaining you're not breaking down the muscle fibers you know and afford to recoup I feel you know when you go and lift I'm not saying every exact time you got to kill it but when I go in I want to do either a little bit heavier or more reps than I did last time you know what I mean for me to get to the point where I want to get in it has worked for me I do I feel like when you write down the only time I do write things down is if I'm doing a chart I'll go through that chart and then when I finished with it I finish out with so many reps in that same percentile of my PR you know what I mean and I'll go down now then I have a speed day an endurance day what's it and that's when I rep out and I do sometimes up to three hundred reps you know on a body part and speed and endurance and then before I even do that I work on safe as bench or squats I get two bands and then I have my guys do no more to six reps and it all got to be explosion because that helps in powerlifting for that one rep max you know it explosion love so it comes down you know and that's my theory on and a lot of people you know do it and then you got guys who do write down though do you think there's any benefit in the kind of lifting that you're doing now for a boxer I think right now if you have the time yeah it could help if you atomic in between guys if you had time to get that big or get that strong for maybe two months of heavy but I'd also think that you need a good period of no heavy lifting to recover before we start really boxing so your body is going to be used to it muscle memory you know you'll still be you're not gonna lose all that strength because you're not just stopping the powerlifting and not doing anything you know it's it seems like a real guessing game or at least an experiment I wouldn't try it if I was active and I had active fighter but yeah I would like to see somebody try that eventually one day you never know they're always coming up with something or they're always debunking some other you know you have to do this my favorite thing is where I get in about to training what people say you can't do this two days a week you can't bench or squat look at your guys in Jill all they do every day is words yeah if I lift weights and each city food and they don't have the supplements that we have you know they can't take a protein powder drink and BCA's so and and they're not smaller huge or jacked sort of lifts in everyday you know so I don't know well you feel familiar with Pavel taught Shalini yes well the guy also with the kettlebells yeah yeah he's he's got some interesting thoughts about about strength training in particular because he's one of those guys he believes you should do more rest in between reps less reps and you should do it more often so instead of like one brutal workout a week where you break your body down you walk like you're getting fucked in the ass by a rhino for two days instead of that you you workout with less repetitions don't go to failure but do it two or three times a week you get more repetitions overall over the end of the week but you'll you'll be able to recover better and you never get that full breakdown but your body gets just as strong or stronger I seen that now actually I was reading on that and I was gonna put that in you know put that into my program and I read a lot of them I see like summonses word Westside mm-hmm they got some great ideas and that's when it comes to lifted weights and powerlifting there's only so much so somebody's got it from somebody you don't mean like Westside they were big with the Russian Olympic team and everything else there's only so much you could do there's only so many programs you could do where you're not tapping in and copying off this um I think adding that in there's nothing wrong with that either now not changing it up after a while in shock in that body I think that actually helps you get stronger you know and changing the program a little bit but um you know that works I don't know and that's something that I may try out one day because I'm doing powerlifting but pilots ain't gonna be my vacation home in Hawaii you just doing the powerlifting for everyone yeah for fun yeah well you know was something that was fun and I got guys who I got involved with a buddy of mine actually a coach on you know certain days of the week we work on a heavy Lonnie Atkins he's great he's uh like six seven time world champion powerlifting drug-free you know Federation's like raw and W MPF and I and asked what I'm in because I feel like you know I have not knocking the other people that used the steroids and stuff but for me I like going the natural route and you know it's fun or especially if you think about fighting again because if you do you don't want to fuck up your endocrine system stit also is because of the boxing yeah you know what I mean I I don't want to make anybody too mad but when people use it I feel like you're taken away and then I do feel like it's cheating I tell people in a gym my gym you know there's certain people interdite that do it and they try to come over and tell people how to workout and that's kind of like listen you're working out is totally different than this guy's and what you do to get big is totally different all because of that reason yeah it is it truly is and especially powerlifting exactly and I got guys right now there are freaks of nature that do it and you could tell that they're not on it because if they are then he had that long talk with their dealer you know what I mean one of those type things but I like doing it because for me guess it's not cheating you know and also I like the fact of like when I hit a plateau I look it's more fun for me to go through and research things and look at like how do I get out of that and what's what's good nutrition that helps naturally raise this or raise that you know what I mean and different workout routines I like the board work chains you know to add that all in so that's where it comes fun for me also yeah do you do do you get your blood work done or anything like that I did get a blood panel last year just last year yeah that's it yeah I think you don't get like normal ones I'm afraid oh man I'm going I'm getting to the age you know I don't want that shit coming back it's like bad you don't want to know yeah you know hell if I start feeling it then I'll go but um no buddy you should too I recommend it to everybody and every athlete you know they should and eventually my time is to go back soon also yeah I think it's a really important thing I think everybody should do it on a regular basis I really do I know you don't want to know about anything bad but you do know but yeah you have to if there really was something funky going on and you know you went to the doctor and a doctor's like Kelly these these numbers are bad this is we got a we got to do some more exactly work more tests and see what the fuck's happening you especially with all these different diets that people were getting on I'm seeing yeah horrific things I had a brother-in-law from you know a certain diet that keto diet you know what happened to fatty liver that's because he's not you don't drink yeah that's what I'm here well you if you really look at it I mean you're eating the fat all that fat is something good for you yeah but if that's all your body got to burn you know and your organs got to that what happens with people where it does get dangerous is first of all that with if you have certain certain genes certain people it's just not the best diet for and it's it's a lot of trial and error to find out but it's also if you engage in a high fat content content diet but you also have high carbohydrate which is where a lot of people cheat and fuck up that's not good that's that's not good for you like you you gotta get your body in Iquitos in Indy keto stuff yeah if you don't get your body into ketosis and you're taking this high level of fat and the co high level carbs it's not it's just not a good course and what it also is you know what I do on it if you come off of it you can't just indulge into the carbs either right don't you slowly work that back into well it your body always knows how to process carbs it's more difficult to get your body fat adapted but once your body does get fat adapted what I found is I'm not on the ketogenic diet right now but when I've been on it I can get back in it pretty quick but it takes a while like the first time I did it it took a solid two weeks before I felt normal for two weeks I was dry it was hard to stick through it I didn't want to stick through it I just wanted to I'm like I'm just gonna have a fucking apple and a bowl of pasta and blow this duck off but if you get through it then you feel your body switch over when you feel your body switch over what happens is you have more even energy throughout the day less tired no crash in the middle of the day but I do have to say it took a long time before my workouts felt like I could have the same intensity intensity I would die off quicker and that's how I look at even some of those what do you call intermittent dieting x' 2 min fasting you have fasting yeah I like the when you're drying out and you're not eating and I period I wouldn't recommend working out at that time powerlifting or her strength training yeah I think that's a different kind of animal yeah because now you're getting into tearing down the muscles everything else maybe some cardio wouldn't hurt listen I'm not that's why I'm saying I'm not knocking all of them and I had my brother-in-law you know a doctor told him they think that's what it was from now granted that could be because he messed up on a diet somewhere along the line you know I mean I had a doctor that I buddied also died got fatty liver from eating too much of the meat again that could have been grass-fed or steroid type meat makes it your pasta what the fuck yeah I don't know if that does causes that does yeah and me personally I'm not knocking any of it because they're pretty soon I gotta try some shit myself you don't I mean I gotta start losing weight again well did you start eating like crazy because of the power left yeah those guys now heat like fucking savages and now they're also coming out to like where you could eat right and lose weight and still be strong you know me I started eating like that and then it really I thought where it gets me so I was never a real big sweet sweet to theater I I use a piece of cake or a candy bar here and there I'd have like total throughout the day one can of pop I drink a half a can in the morning or an afternoon then that night hop for people who didn't grow up in Ohio in Ohio oh yeah soda okay coca-cola Pepsi you know sorry your pop guy rhombic man yeah yeah there you go Ohio in the house yes and that's right yeah we talked about that and that's what I would do so it wasn't that bad but I stole enough sugar you got a long fucking sugar yeah and then I have a start at the one meet I was doing a 220 pound weight class that was 232 yeah my guy was like you ain't gonna make it in six days to get down to 220 and that kind of like I get a chuckle to at that because I had to make 160 before so I got all this fat sitting on me you're gonna tell me I can't lose that in six days bet and this is for a powerlifting yeah so I got down with that and I was doing a watch what I didn't even do hardly in the cardio for that and I still got down fairly easy to 220 then now we're I'm falling into this bad habit is I'll have like a piece of cheesecakes in the refrigerator okay I know and I love cheesecake and that's - that's one of my favorites it's a good one and it would be two cans of pop left right and my whole thing is I can't start I can't start watching cuz I don't want to say diet I start saying watching what I eat and I go I can't do that so that's gone I can't have that I don't buy this weird oh yeah okay I can't start it till it's gone but you can't throw it away I can't throw it away and I've seen you throw it away because it's only one piece left and I don't want to do that so and then the next thing I know my sister-in-law who who's a hell of a baker she makes something for the kids or makes me a homemade cheesecake and the next thing I know I'm back into the same thing and now let me tell you something else that that contributes to this I think all the years of fighting and having to watch my weight and especially for me to get down to 160 and even when I was fighting at 47 in the amateurs my life was pretty much running and it was a job you know it was time somebody was there I just couldn't go run I had to run it so fast and I was being time forward and distance I had to watch what I was eating I had people over me watching what I was eating and when I retired I was like fuck this man I'm free right you don't I mean and I I sometimes put that in the back of my head I shouldn't but I putting it back my leg man you deserve this man screw it you did that all these years like but now it's coming to the point to like you are get a little older you look a little bit like shit other than your arm like you're gonna have to start hitting a treadmill you don't to me that's one of those type things where you just cut the sugar out yeah and it works and I don't want to hear people say that they can't lose weight now that will only work for a certain period of time until that like levels out then you guys that's when you start tweaking the calorie intake and right thing you can owes a lot of weight if you just cut out the sugar yeah you can yeah so that's why I mean I don't want to hear people say it's hard so I'm eventually a you know I said when I get home from this trip because like last night I went out with my buddy and we ate pizzas and stuff like that so you know some what I don't have the access to healthy food right now right while you're on the road yes plenty places in LA you need help I don't dare you yeah dare you say you can't eat healthy here's to my set man I know yeah the mindset that's you know the thing about a lot of great fighters is they're very impulsive - yeah it's just that fuck it fuck it mentality that sometimes carries over to eating look at a lot of your guy retired fighters yeah I think I mean again I keep saying I'm not like bragging or anything but here I'm I'm fairly decent you know I mean I think at least you enjoy working out I think some guys they got to a point where they worked out so hard for camps that when it's over they don't want to do shit yeah just like I'm done it's over no desire no Drive well that's why cardio is very rare for me right yeah and you know I used to say this to all the time after a fight yeah I have fight - three weeks off and I there was a place called Mill Creek Park and a lot of people go to run and exercise and stuff like that there's a main street that goes past the park and you see people riding a bike and running and I'll never forget my wife actually started laughing I just got done with a fight and we're driving past Mill Creek Park and these people are all running know what idiots like who gets up a garage you know and after chances are I am - Larry and I chances are I if I didn't have to do it like that I didn't have somebody hounding me or over me while I was running chances are I would actually Lake running and I would like doing cardio and AD and I did - my my training but because it was a job for all them years from nine years old to thirty years old it was like screw this man I want to run you'll give you to run as if there's a fire or a big-ass dog behind me you know it's the only way that I or if I want to run to the buffet table but I know some people do it every day yeah you know every day before work and they're put in five six miles every day and you know what in this reality you have to yeah you got to anymore if you unless you want to be out of shape and and miserable I think it's great to actually start working out and even for me I'm lifting weights and it's fun and it's considered exercising and now what what I'm thinking of doing and everything else I got to start getting into that you know hitting the bag and everything's fun and I'm hitting the pads and that's cardio I mean that should that shit's really cardio and now the but if you're really thinking about finding and you're you said more than 60 percent right yeah eighty percent I would say between around 70 to 80 that's a lot that is that is but again and I'm strong I'm gonna say this there's a lot of that goes behind a lot more to think about also you know so I don't want because what I don't want is in six months when I say you know what no I don't want the backlash for it right he's walked up again and he knows and that's unfortunately that's the way it goes it does but you gotta not read that shit I know but that's unfortunately it really is this movie comments you know I tried not to did you catch on yeah you get to us it seems like the boxing world in particular has a lot of fuckin haters but you know what it's nothing like football like if a fighter loses I was I was watching barstool sports barstool sports Instagram they got some fucking guy leaving a football game screaming and yelling I'm like this guy is what I think about what I think of like douched out like sports fans this guy fucking screaming about somebody not be able to make a kick yeah yeah it's so funny I love I love it I love it I love hearing uh when I was playing football when I was in high school when you're watching these big games you'll see it on social or I'd be on a buddies house and I see have a I would have made that yeah fuck out of here people love saying stupid shit like that like how many times does anybody giving you boxing advice oh I have people that don't know the difference between a left hook and a fishing hook I swear to God they don't and why didn't you just hit him because you should have got up and hit him this team zimas it material no but I mean like like they're saying to you why didn't why didn't you just hit him I don't know you know that I seen an episode that was the funniest I I think it was on one of your episodes with Charlie Murphy and they were doing to Mike Tyson and like De La Hoya situation that happened like the guys that he could beat up be La Hoya and I true I wish I could happen on a regular basis you know like call people out on it when you're in front of somebody right how many times I hear people say that guy I could I could have beat him and it's like why is he sitting on like 25 million dollars and you're over here picking up UPS shipments you know what I mean like there's a difference for a reason nobody's knocking what you do but you shouldn't knock what he's doing well you're delusional you are people who are delusional for whatever reason especially when it comes to sports and fighting in particular people just say some unbelievably delusional shit I don't know why and I truly don't and I don't understand it and I'd never get into the argument long enough to even ask the question when was the last time you went on somebody else's page and commented on shit III can't tell you yeah cuz you're a world champion yeah and I don't know hey listen you know that's funny too because how many of them I want to write how many of the threads in it might involve me because I you know again a reason why I have to stay up on it is because that's part of my podcast right you know we're through to social media so I have to end these box and groups aren't even on our own fight or punch line boxing group you see that the comments and I'm just going like I can't really answer that because a little corny as shit if I answer that one right you know it's hard and it's frustrating it really is yeah well the the the interesting world that we live in today I mean it's a great time to communicate with people it's amazing it's also a great time for douchebags to communicate it is dangerous time actually yeah but I think it's cool that you're doing this podcast thing and I I think it's awesome and I really do hope you do commentary as far as you fighting a man if you find out watch but if you don't fight I'll be happy to I'll definitely keep you in the loop tell me I know I
