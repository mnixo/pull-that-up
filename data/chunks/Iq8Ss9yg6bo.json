three two okay so very nice to meet you and very your book is fantastic I've really really loved it and it's kind of hilarious how this conversation came about you said you got a call from your publicist because your audiobook spiked its spiking like crazy it was like what cosmic dust and the BAM outer bands of Jupiter just did that because we don't figure out what it was it just spiked like crazy went nuts I think it went to number one briefly okay so what did that anyway and it was from an Instagram post it was and you will see my friend Steve Rinella wrote a book called American Buffalo and I had put on Instagram how great the book was and he did the audio version of it and a friend of mine on Instagram he goes by the name of the Jackalope he's a fellow hunter as Thompson enthusiast he said you got to read this book and so he he tells me to read your book and empire of the summer moon yes yeah and it was amazing I mean he was absolutely right and it was so good and I I made an Instagram post about that there it is it's a fantastic book there's so much good stuff in there and I just it was it was so sad and so gripping and so riveting and you we all know that a lot of horrific things happened in the time where the settlers started making their way across the plains and right headed west but God you just did such a fantastic job of sort of bringing it to life it's all those things is brutal it's sad it's incredibly dramatic it's it's I mean I just think people forget about what the frontier was it was kind of a nice idea that you get on on TV or something but it was it was a savage place anyway I will ask I was trying to convey it with this and with the minimum possible of people being staked out on anthills with their eyelids cut off and things like that so there's a lot of that yeah I mean that the horrors of it all it's like foof you know and I'd never see I had no I knew that that kind of stuff had taken place but I'd really never read it so graphically depicted before before this book what what motivated you to write about all this so what what this is a book about me I'm a Connecticut Yankee Massachusetts Connecticut guy I moved to Texas twenty-five years ago and and I've been there ever since and I didn't know anything about Texas history nothing beyond whatever you might know about the Alamo or something or Sam Houston or somebody like that and I got there and I just started to you know I started to hear about what won the Great Plains and what they were which was an alien concept to me I wasn't sure what the plains were or why they were different than some other part of the country the high plains and I came into this idea I came upon this idea that the last frontier was there that this is where it all went down this is where like the end of freedom and limitlessness it was it didn't happen the frontier didn't push forward until it got to California and then hit the ocean California settled the east settled and then there was this one last place that did not and it went on forever anywhere reasons for that one of which was the most hostile Indian tribes in the country another was that it was there was no water water you know there was basically only land no water or timber but so I got into this and then hello and behold there's this I find out because I live in Texas that there's this principle that lives on this that lived on this land the Comanches that determined everything that happened in the American West around them and that's not an exaggeration they would they were because until you know the West wasn't one until they lost it and that was for sure and so there were two things one this arc of the rise and fall of the most powerful tribe most influential tribe in American history the Comanches which was very cool from the Spanish and the horse and all sorts of big stuff that goes on and then in the middle of that story was this little story of this little nine year old girl was you know blonde hair and cornflower blue eyes who gets taken in a Comanche raid in 1836 who ends up becoming the you know mother of the last and greatest chief of the Comanches and in fact her kidnapping and his surrender at the very end the Comanches you know sort of bookend a 40 year war we never fought a 40 year guesswork war against anybody except them so I ran into this story and I'm just the kid from Connecticut and it just seemed like the most obvious book in the world it was just the coolest history it's a crazy story and I've never heard of Cynthia Ann Parker before now she's we have run your well we have a giant a metal picture of her on the walls because it was so powerful your depiction of it - I wanted to I wanted to find out what she looks like and what is his name again Quan Quan so Quan Quan Quan Oh what was his the name cover of the book right he be because his mother was Cynthia Ann Parker which was not that didn't become that didn't come out and no one found out that until he was much older so he was born Quanah as a Comanche later in the reservation period when people found out who he was he identified as part of the Parker family also oh wow yeah so he as a famous Comanche war chief and he was one of the most famous and and feared he was Quanah it's such a crazy story that they killed so many people but occasionally they would keep people and bring them into the tribe right so there were rules of the frontier at the time and we're talking about how savage it was and the rules of the at least of the Plains Indians of which the Comanches were one that if you were captured as an adult male you were killed tortured to death either quickly or slowly depending on how much time they had if you were a baby you were killed they couldn't deal with the baby baby was they were nomads and they were on their horse and they were probably escaping from whatever raid they had just done they couldn't deal with babies a teenage girl or a young woman would possibly be killed but likely turned into a sort of a slave the ones who had a chance of being adopted into the tribe were the you know eight nine ten eleven twelve year olds because Comanches had trouble keeping their numbers up and so they instinctively kind of they would take these captives and not just from you know white people if from the Apaches in the Utes in the Navajos and whoever they might take them from and so what was interesting about the frontier though is that those rules applied so long but forgetting forget about white people arriving in the early 18th century for the moment those rules had applied to Indian tribes since forever you know that was the assumption of a raid they all had it was it was almost like the golden rule in Reverse or the golden rule do unto others they all expected that kind of treatment none of them were shocked when a baby was killed or a pregnant woman was killed it took the kind of the you know the angle European civilization of you know newton and leibniz in the biblical tradition to arrive on the Texas frontier in 1830 and be shocked at what they saw very interesting very savage very brutal it was a it was a culture of raiding essentially this is the Comanche culture in particular or the Comanche Americans in general yeah well Native Americans in general Plains Indians in general and you know so Plains Indians we could kind of start you know you would know the names of the law of a lot of Arapaho and Cheyenne and Sioux and these were people who operated out in the great wide open they were all masters of the horse what made the Comanches special was that they they became the preeminent horse tribe now people forget that there weren't any horses in this in in the continent until the Spanish brought them in the sixteenth century and so the the the tribes that got the horse and mastered the horse basically altered the entire balance of power and the plains and the tribe that got the horse better than anybody else in terms of breaking and breeding and saddling and riding and stealing and hunting on the back of and fighting with were the Comanches and nobody was there Pierre and so this was this was not just a Plains tribe it was the preeminent power on the southern plains did you know that horses originally evolved here in North America no and then they went exactly wedeck and then they reintroduced them really the Europeans did yeah there's a guy named Dan Flores he's got a bunch of great books and one of them is called coyote America he's got another one what is this other book about the the various large land animals that went extinct here in North America but that the wolf and a lot of the other ones wasn't concern Getty that's it natural Les Halles yeah yeah he's fantastic and essentially they all went extinct all the horses went extinct here and then they were reintroduced by Europeans but they had originally evolved here in Florida America I didn't know so there's no but there's no evidence that any of the native people here really used them until Europeans came whether it was Cortes or whoever you know what Cortes with the Aztecs or whoever else came across horses a horse is so much a part of this story the you know but so they come up with the Spanish the Spanish are acutely aware of what is going to happen if the horse technology gets out and they take great pains to not let it get out they don't want to teach the Indians in Mexico or the Indians in North America on how to use them but inevitably the technology does get out and then there's a few moments there's a great moment in time in 1680 in Santa Fe when there's a great Pueblo Revolt and they kick the Spanish out in like tens of thousands of horses get out it's the great horse dispersal and and and these are the horses that come into the hands of the police Plains tribes so it was in the 1600s that their power and their dominance started to serve itself begins of the Comanches figure out how to have all these horses and how how valuable that was or some of the other tribes just hadn't kind of caught on no one knows and and it's it's interesting no one knows that because you it was only seen in flashes by the Spanish through their kind of northern outpost no one exactly knows what it was you know in the heart and soul of a Comanche that could do that better than anybody else but in fact Comanches but by all descriptions of the time were not pre horse and they wait graceful people they were kind of short and kind of you know bowlegged and they they weren't especially graceful and and they didn't they didn't look like perhaps you would have think of the the northern Sioux Indians of the nig on the nickel I mean that kind if tall and you know with the bone structure that wasn't the Comanches and then they got on a horse and then everything changed and and and even though the Apaches were the first ones to actually get that technology from the Spanish and they crazed they raised havoc with it but the tribe that got it the best and the most were the Comanches they were the tribe that actually ended up supplying horses to a lot of the Northern Plains tribes that we just talked about and what they did with once they had this incredible mastery of the horse and this ability to hunt like they never had and fight like they never had they did what you would I guess expect the great new power and the planes and the planes are a big place by that I mean the great new power of the place it's got a challenge for the greatest food source out in Mid America and that was the buffalo herds and they were in the southern plains so the Comanches over a period of a hundred and fifty years of sustained combat moved south from the Wind River mountains of Wyoming essentially into this 250,000 square mile empire think of kind of headquartered in the pick Texas Panhandle which is where the buffalo were and this tribe they were known for being buffalo hunters and they were also known that they weren't really like making artwork or doing a lot of the things that we sort of associate with other Native American tribes or mostly just hunting they were writing and things that we all would associate with Native Americans you know this wonderful abilities and dance and music complex religion and complex religious social structures to go along with it and all these different things music and dance and all these things the Comanches by the time that the kind of Anglo Europeans run into them they are a stripped-down culture that looks more like Sparta and one of the reasons they are is because they've been fighting this long war primarily against the Apaches but against other tribes over decades and during that time as they became ascendant militarily they became less interested in those things they became interested in war conveyed status right war conveyed numbers of ponies and status and and so yes they were they were a stripped-down war culture I guess to whatever extent we know or something about Sparta I would remind you of Sparta that's what's so interesting about it is is such a unique tribe just a very unique branch of Native Americans that was specifically like this they made war and they and they conquered and when you know when you think about what they got themselves finally it's about I said 250,000 square miles this probably doesn't mean anything but think of West Texas western Oklahoma western Kansas eastern Colorado and eastern New Mexico gigantic chunks of that that was theirs and and when you think of the numbers of them that were there when when say the Anglo Europeans and the Americans came through in the 1830s there was probably 25 or 30,000 of them out there of which five or six thousand warriors now I don't know what five or six thousand suggests you but it suggests to me like the third baseline at Yankee Stadium or something it's not very many people mm-hmm you know occupying this gigantic area that that became as we were saying earlier determinants of everything that happened around it well your depictions of how the raid happened where Cynthia Ann Parker got kidnapped and how all these other various raids happened was so terrifying because these people the initial ones really kind of had no idea what they were in for these are the Parkers yeah yes so so the the core so as I say that my books about the you know the rise and fall the Comanches is a tribe which we've been talking about but then there's this little family the Parkers and the Parkers did what so many other Texans did and and this was the crazy Americans who who moved across their frontiers in ways that just were they were beyond brave into foolhardy I mean people if you look at say what what happened in Canada or what the Spanish did there was always that you know the soldiers would ride in first and set up the Presidio and then the then the priests would come in and you know the mission would be set up and then the protections would be in place and the institutions and then the people would come in Texas it was just these red from Tennessee and Alabama coming through with no protection of any kind you know no there were no institutions they were out beyond any form of security or protection or institutions and so this is what the Parkers were in 1830s they were about 90 miles south of Dallas and you had Spanish in New Mexico but but nothing but Comanches and Apaches between where these people were and and that so you know 800 miles of nothing and and so what they had done is they they had taken these head rights or grants from Mexico which was which owned Texas at that point they'd been given about you know 20,000 acres worth which is a kingdom from their point of view and the Mexicans were giving them this so that they could provide a buffer against the Comanches basically providing fresh meat for the Comanches and so they built this little fort out there out right at the end and it was it was so cool it was not only out in the middle of nowhere the absolute edge of the frontier of the Indian frontier where where it was in great danger it was also right at a part where the rainfall drops you know below 30 inches where we go from the around the 98th Meridian where we go from what we think of as the east to the west where there's no trees right which it happens right there too it also happens right that this this raid in 1830 that started this out and where the little blonde girl is taken this also happens at a time when when this gigantic Comanche Empire with 20 vassal states and no diplomatic relations touches this westward booming American Empire all these guys in Washington were in suits and running around that Empire is and they're touching right at this point and neither has any idea what the other one is the Comanches have no idea that these Parker family is sitting there attached in some way to cities in the east and the burgeoning Industrial Revolution they would not know what that was by the same token the the Americans coming West had absolutely no clue that they just hid they just did what they shouldn't have done which was to push in to come she territory it's so crazy that they set them up like that oh so dark me but it's it's just such a wild time too I mean but also so recent I mean I'm 52 so we're talking about three of my lifetimes three of my lifetimes ago it was on like Donkey Kong down there just crazy it's it's hard to believe that that recently some unbelievably horrific barbaric hand-to-hand combat killing people and slaughtering entire villages and other stuff that went back and forth between the Native Americans between the white settlers I mean it was just it's unbelievable it's one of the most what you just said is one of the most striking things about this to me and was when I the you know that the Connecticut kid came to Texas was that where I grew up you know Indians had been well when I say subdued usually killed off by white man's diseases but if not by you know bullets or treaties or something I mean couple of hundred years before my forebears ever got off the boat there wasn't a frontier in memory anyway I mean there were Indian tribes around and I played baseball with some of them in the summers and so forth I knew of them but this was a really distant memory okay get to Texas 1875 was when the last of the Comanches came in and there was a whole bunch of joseline on and off the rez after that into the 20th century yeah under so what he plus years ago yes so we're talking within a really close generational memory and and that's what's really stunning and if you talk to Tanana where are you from originally just Boston so boss okay you and I okay Boston was born in Jersey but did most of my grown most of my family came from Boston and so the the difference between that and and what if you go to Texas there's that there's an area west of Fort Worth kind of Weatherford Palo Pinto County Parker County now where you can talk to people and they're still talking about command Jesus it's it's their great-grandfather was killed by them Wow so that's Texas and that's why it's so I found it so striking so really striking it's also striking because you realize over the course of the book and I mean just and then more books that have gotten into subsequently that this was something that was going on before the white settlers even got there that this way of life and the rating and the the killing and that's not what we associate Native Americans with we associate with us with taking the Native Americans land and then them fighting back and that's when things get ugly but it turns out this was just a wild way of life that they had had for who knows how many years one of the things that surprised people when I wrote this book and I didn't know that I was going to be surprising people because I was just reporting what I found was was was that that very thing that that this was I think people are often used to the burry my heart at Wounded Knee narrative of the of Native Americans which is as victims yeah and there's no question that they were victims of a westward rolling Empire and 378 broken treaties and we can just go on and we know what that narrative is like but the narrative that I told was an era of power of dominance of power which came with brutality too and I think it surprised it was a fact it was a fact that that if you go back in time these indeed these Native American tribes that eventually got crushed as the Comanches did and put on a reservation somewhere and had their livelihood taken away from them but you know it really anyway it's just it's a it's a huge deal and and a narrative that I think to me that doesn't take into account the enormous power and dominance and behavior of Comanches is just missing you know half the half the narrative well it's so fascinating because it's essentially they were living like Stone Age people and they were doing it very recently they were they were doing it like in terms of the way Europe is you could go and see buildings in Italy that were built long before any of this stuff happened long before the settlers started encountering them and they were living like this and this sort of it's very romantic the way they live just chasing the Buffalo and threeway and killing them and then eating only Buffalo me then doing very little farming picking some berries and nuts and that's about it I mean it was just eating meat and raiding and killing if they were they were hunter-gatherers yeah they were nomadic hunter-gatherers yeah which is what they were and and what the horse allowed them to do was to which is what they had been before the horse allowed them to do that only just really really really well in other words they were they weren't in a position of becoming agricultural Indians the horse gates and this ability to and as you said that they got everything from the Buffalo clothing and lodging and and tools and saddles and bridles and food I mean everything came from the Buffalo so the horse just enabled them to do this an incredibly sophisticated level it's the most sad part of the story is the extra painting of the Buffalo I mean that's not the most sad but one of the that their way of life it's almost like you know what happened but I'm rooting for them in some weird way you know I mean I know that they're not gonna win but there's something about the way they lived it seems so exciting this and the other thing it was the way you described Cynthia Ann Parker post being air-quote rescued like how badly she wanted to go back to the Comanche and how she missed the way they looked at the world that the world was in many ways there was so much magic involved in the way the Comanche viewed the sky and the ground and that there was gods that were looking out for them and that they could literally have magic going into battle like all this the the romance of this nomadic lifestyle was that's what she wanted and like when you talked about that one guy that spoke Comanche and that she meets him and she's like please take me take me with you yeah it's crazy it was so she was she was taken about the age of I guess it was nine and then she was with the Comanches for 24 years she completely assimilated she married a war chief she had three children she they tribe you know at two different times they knew where she was Indian agents figured out where she was and they they they made a push to get her back because the idea generally was to get captives back she wouldn't go and then suddenly in a raid purely by accident she's captured in 1860 and is dragged back and she has to show that she's white so that they don't kill her right right she has to show that she's a woman and and white so that they don't kill her she she barely escapes from that but she ends up being you know forcibly reassimilated so here's someone who completely assimilated once with great success and then in in her 30s now she's taken back into this white culture and in fact they put her up in a they were so astounded to see her because she was indians worth the cleanest people in the world I mean her her job was to kind of you know tan buffalo hides so she heard kind of greasy looking and you know it didn't look like a white farm you know white god-fearing farm woman from from Dallas but they put her up on a you know on a pedestal with her daughter and they kind of looked at her and stared at her as this kind of this strange object the white squaw who wouldn't return this kind of object of curiosity and then she gets kind of shuffled ever deeper into the East Texas piney woods and ever farther away from her her people and she never assimilate it was interesting she was she having assimilated once brilliantly she was asked in effect to do it again and she couldn't and she never did but going back for just one moment to something you said was this idea of this kind of freedom and magic there was in Comanche and it was it was all there it was this it was this world that was suffused with magic everywhere you looked there was magic and everything and but one of the things that also was and this was this was relayed by actually male captives of the Comanches now the Comanches had a very flat hierarchical organization or a very flat hierarchy there was like it may be a war chief in a civil chief but there was really no there were no priest clans and hierarchies there was it was just flat and if you were a quante Park or a young warrior and and you wanted to get together a raid on the youths you could just do it it was just you could do what you wanted to do and so you look at these what does one particular captive was talking about this and he was talking about being 15 years old this is before the Comanche men had to fight and really hunt they could they could do some hunting and but they weren't yet in the full responsibility of men there they are sitting there they've got no responsibilities except to go hunt and have fun and go swimming and learn how to become the greatest riders in the world they've got no institution around them of any kind they've got and you start to think of why do people go west you know away from institutions away from things that we're going to make them less free and so you I looked at and I described it this way a 15 year old Comanche boy may have been like the freest thing that ever existed in in America and I can feel the pull you know yeah I think we all can I mean when we were kids growing up you know you didn't we played cowboys and Indians you know and a lot of people wanted to be Indians you wanted to wear those kind of Native American jackets with the frill and there was so so much of that that was attractive to us and that was a big part of it was that they were free you know Dances with Wolves obviously and you know when Kevin Costner gets assimilated into that tribe there's something exciting about it like it's more noble it's thought to be like a more powerful alternative to this Western grind and and and again you're just you're out there and and and you are beyond the reach of any of the normal institutions that we think about school and work and job and government and religion and church and all the things that bind people in and most people are happy to be bound by them but but many people aren't and I thought that this there was an idea of the West of kind of limitless freedom this west of the predates barbed wire and private property and and that just seemed I don't know I still find it's just one of the most appealing things to think about there and just the fact that it's so recent that's what's really crazy really talking about the urban sprawl and barbed wire and things along those lines I mean and it's particularly in Texas where everything's almost private-property I mean this giant ranches everywhere and this was all run by the Comanche 98% of Texas is unlike if you go one one state to the west and you'll you're it that you're in the big land public land government land states Texas is 98 percent private now that's a weird thing isn't it it is it's very strange how'd that happen well it it happened because that's the way it settled and and the the public land States just there was for one thing there was a lot more of apparently a sort of useless land in in the in the western states but anyway yet it happened and in Texas you're lucky to get yourself a state park here and there when you were doing research for this did you meet with any current Comanches I met with some of them and I know some of them some of them are on my on my website um but as far as interviewing them for things that happened two or three hundred years ago that's not really a sort of a non-starter as a historian although although the book itself is based on lots and lots of interviews with Comanches but of the era people who this is this was the great there was some great projects done in the 20s and 30s with Comanches who talked about you know who had memories of the 19th century and so a lot of what we know with it's in my book that we know about the Comanches and who they are come from all of these interviews and there's a lot in my book that comes from Comanches but again of the era so you know I just figured that interviewing people today about things that have a long time ago was probably not that efficient no for sure not that efficient but still to me would be kind of fascinating to see where they are now I mean the the Native American reservations in this country have traditionally been pretty horrific and it's very depressing and sad and for the people that lived there just so so little hope and so little opportunity and it's it's oh as you were talking about before the broken treaties and just to see them having gone from being this incredible warlike tribe to being resigned to these very small patches of land that are usually not very fruitful not very resource filled and that happened to a lot of tribes if you look at the Comanches the Comanches are pretty small tribe they're they they they're located in their center although there's no reservations you know there's no excuse me all right yeah they don't have a yell under the flue they don't have a reservation there but they there I'd say the last number I heard was 14,000 or something like that one of the big I guess ironically in some ways determinant factors in how wealthy a tribe is now is proximity to a major urban area for example Chickasaws and Choctaws are in range of DFW so their casinos there make a lot of money the Seminoles in Florida there are some tribes in California who are making a lot of money if you go up to say some of the Sioux reservations you know well up north on the plains they're not near they just did there they're the lands their traditional lands just don't happen to be close to urban centers yeah urban centers and so there's a little bit of that going on there but yeah that's they this is just you know where where we the US government put the Indians and and in terms of Plains Indians and Comanches and Arapahos and Cheyenne's and Sioux and everybody else they never wanted to be farmers they farming was exactly what they never wanted to do and even if you gave them 160 acres they would they would sublet it they would rent it out to - usually a white farmer who would farm it and they would take a sharecropping percentage or something but yes so they they didn't want anything to do with that and and above all they didn't want to be forced into a type of life that they that they had never done before and considered it just kind of unseemly so do Comanches have a reservation today no no reservation at all well the the problem is the way this is going to get into a lot of detail but I mean Oklahoma they basically they they in favor of in place of reservations they gave out individual apportionments of land and had them ascend so where I work for example where I came from in the East Coast there are reservations if you go to say Colorado you'll go to see the ute reservation was some of the Sioux Reservation Sue's reservations all over the place not in Oklahoma wow so they're in danger of having their culture probably get it erased there pretty I mean I think they would they would tell you I mean I want to speak for Comanches or anybody else but that they're that they're you know they're they're pretty strongly organized where they are they they have a nation they do have a nation is just they don't have a body of a reservation but they do have a nation but if they have a nation they don't have the same sort of laws that one have a relevation know they actually do so if you go for example I spent some time with the Chickasaws a few years ago it's incredible now they don't have a quote reservation either but they have they have little pieces of land that is theirs but they also have a completely parallel police system completely parallel legislature they have parallel healthcare systems and you can and you can drive through these parts of Oklahoma where I don't say Choctaws or some or Cherokees or whoever they may be are and there are these whole parallel worlds they're existing right in front of you and you don't see them Wow there yes so no I actually I think they're in a lot of ways a lot of the tribes in Oklahoma are doing well but you even you literally can drive through it and you you wouldn't be able to tell it's just such a stunning amount of change that happen to this continent over a short relatively short period of time yeah I mean really astounding and and if you look at what from from the moment that the last Comanche surrendered with Quan when quanta and the the last of the starving have a had all the Buffalo have been killed now and so they're they're coming in and it's 1875 you know that very year their old kind of Maine I guess camping ground would be Palo Duro Canyon one of the biggest canyons in the American West up in the Texas Panhandle and that's kind of where their their sanctuary was or one of their big sanctuaries worth within that very year white men already owned Palo Duro Canyon there was already a ranch on it it was already private property within a few years there's barbed wire going all the way up I mean it this is happening I mean so in other words you have you have the transfer of ownership suddenly white people own the land that the Indians used to used to be theirs right the second thing that happens is now we have the cattle drives just before barbed wire and then there's only a few years of cattle drives and then the barbed wire goes up and this happens with just breathtaking speed and I mean from really the moment that they started killing the Buffalo off in the what eighteen seventy or something 1871 - I mean full barbed wire it's just it's less than a couple decades it's such a great story and then the the fact that this young girl Cynthia Ann Parker gets kidnapped and gives birth to this man who eventually becomes the last great Comanche chief and literally watches the entire empire change and shift into this what we now call Western world yep he rides in Teddy Roosevelt's inaugural parade that was also what's crazy about the book like that he meets Teddy and he has a speech with him on stage and this is all I mean he had killed all a lot of white people to write a lot of settlers he didn't talk about it but yes he had this is because that's what Comanches did yeah well so wise of him also did not talk about right and not only Comanches he but he was he fought Indians he fought anybody that's out there but yes he didn't he didn't spend a lot of time bragging about that yeah I mean I guess it's just the way they felt about war what is this Jaime at the parade oh here's the parade there's another one he is but there's six of them in the parade Wow and what year is this over 1908 Oh 8 I think oh what a insane relationship that must have been for those people to be experiencing first of all these enormous cities and going through Washington DC on horseback and now knowing what you had come from and what a catastrophic Titanic change had taken place inside of your lifetime and now you're experiencing something that you didn't even think was possible and it's the the new law of the land is that it does look like kkona doesn't it in the middle but I mean he and he was you know he was not just ceremonial Indian I mean he he was a brilliant man and he one of the things he did is he went to New York I mean went to Washington and he testified and there were all these there were all these hearings trying to figure out how much land Indians were going to get and quantum tors testified this and actually it's quite brilliant I put his testimony in my book he's just flat brilliant he sort of runs circles around the senator who's questioning him so but he would so he played an active role too but there he is as you said he's sitting in a committee room in Congress I mean this guy who was this great free warrior on the plains now how long did it take you to research this I you know I did this partly while I was at a day gig so I'm not really sure probably three or four years something like that there isn't as much as you would think because and the reason is I mean there's a fair amount and it's all in Texas which is good um but there is one curious thing about writing about Native Americans is that they don't they didn't write anything down so so if you're writing about say Winston Churchill I mean you can track him from like his bath in the morning to his seventh note to ask would and is know to ask with to to his notes to his wife to all of his proceedings in Parliament and everything he ever did it's like moment by moment you take someone like Kawana out on the plains and you've got pretty much nothing and so which you have what you do have are you know flashes that are seen by say this the Spanish originally or the French or Mexicans or Texans and Americans as they come through you're seeing them in flashes as they're presented to because there are no parish records there's no legal records there's no interviews there's no things like that that's so stunned yeah it's so stunning but that's one of the weirdest things about where they are today in 2019 this idea that they don't have really a reservation or specific giant chunk of land that's theirs they sort of preserve at least some of this history ya know it's um it was a peculiarity of Oklahoma that that that it went that way because there are other states as we talked to better who have large large reservations to this day but yeah so it's it's so and when you get if you're writing about them when you get to sort of the the post reservation period so let's say into the 1880s 1890s the the world does change in terms of things are being written down quanta you know quanta becomes a big part of his society's settling up cattle leasing deals he's founding a school board I mean he does all these things that you know that you wouldn't necessarily think a glorious chief of the Comanches would do but he does those things and and those are very trackable I mean you know exactly what he's doing and you can research them and in conventional ways I was fascinated by the peyote rituals to know was that a natural normal part of Comanche life or is this something that he adopted from other tribes he he adapted it from something that had gone on on the border on the Mexican border but if he became the founder of the Native American church which had a peyote ritual in which he and it became famous for and so there was if there was this great a place I would really like to go back to in American history would be to quanah's house Kawana got his cattlemen buddies to build him you first of all he wanted the US government to build in the house because con it was hustler and could I please have a house they say you can't have house so he went to his cattlemen buddies and they built in this house magnificent house and Willie 4,500 square feet double porch with these giant white stars in the roof it became known as satis house right there that's star house it's falling down but now but yes and in its heyday it looked really so that still exists to this day it does and it's about to fall down and they feel owns it well this guy who lives in cash or Lawton Oklahoma and who doesn't who has been unwilling to accept help or money from everybody from the Comanche nation - that's it right there there's always had the stars yeah yeah it did because he saw that US generals had these stars and their colors and he wanted he wanted like more than they had Wow and but that's that's this sits there in cash Oklahoma no no I've been in it but but it's gotten so beat up now that they've they don't let you go in and anymore bill sits there so so that we had so as long as we have that there in 1895 if you went there needs I say early 1890s you it would have been one of the most amazing scenes we had people like Geronimo coming to dinner Roosevelt came to dinner and Nelson miles the great general came to dinner he had a I think it was a Swiss Mexican cook he had six wives he had 19 21 children 19 who grew to adulthood the house is full of kids it would have been surrounded by lodges and the reason it would have been as because people his own tribe had come in and for help you money or pay for a funeral or orab or going back to the peyote a peyote ritual which is a healing ritual and so you would have seen one of the great scenes in the American West and and people went when he died in 1911 people found out that he'd given most of his money away in to all these people who had come in asking for his help he had in fact helped them and given most of his cattle ranching money away that he had made now this house is owned by one individual yes and so but it's a historical landmark and no one's preserving it they're not doing anything to you know it I don't know all the details of it but it's owned by Wayne Gibson and his sister as far as I know still and they've owned it for a while they don't want any help it was that house was put into an amusement park years ago to preserve it that was owned by Wayne's uncle as far as I know and so taken apart it was was it taken apart I don't know they did move it though they moved so this is not the original location where it says right now the original location was out on what turned out to be later to be a Fort Sill gunnery artillery range and so they they moved it and so quanah's a daughter I guess it was moved it down into cache and then it was moved one more time into this amusement park literally that when I went into this amusement park it was like something out of a I don't know a Spielberg movie I mean you go I was told the house was back there and I couldn't really believe it but so we go in and you're going by these deep dolt in rollercoasters that are all overgrown with vines like Sleeping Beauty's castle you know and and there's cows everywhere and and and rides and carousels all grow all overgrown and then you go through a series of houses that were also moved there like Frank James's house or something and keep going keep going in the back there that thing was the house was sitting there now it is his he owns it he's been approached as I said by all sorts of different people consortiums of people with money who want to buy it or or just save it you know from literally the Comanche nation I know has wanted to and Texas Tech has and some Dallas people and any number of people and so the to my knowledge thus far he refuses to sell or or to take their help was that him right there I think it is that's him wait wait wait Gibson yeah yeah hey so he's a perfectly nice guy it's it's a he feels the house is very special in his family and it is indeed very special but he won't the last time the last tour I got with him as you're going up the main stairwell there was a four foot by six inch hole in the main in the roof above the main stairwell I mean you can't really have a four foot by six inch hole no there is so right and the rain would just come through and but so can you do to preserve a house like this while still leaving it the way it is so it's you know I'm saying like you would have to replace the wood now if you replace the wood is it still the same house like there's arguments about boats yeah they've found some ancient boats and they've done some rebuilding of these boats now also you're looking at new wood and the shape of this old boat like what is it visit what is it yeah so I tell you the first time I walked in there which was 15 years ago you wouldn't have needed to do that much work to it 15 years ago yeah you would not have needed to do what it needed some bolstering for sure in the foundation what it needed some work but it has gone way downhill because nothing's been done to it so now I don't know what but when I walked in there you you really could have a good carpenter and you know carpenter team a month you could have shirred that Jesus Christ yeah that's so sad yeah and I don't know how much of it I mean a lot of it was the problem was with all those holes in it and stuff it started to rot and rot because rod is different than ya you know and then you would have to actually really replace that wood so at the end of the day was going to be a certain percentage I was gonna be new but at least you could sort of get a semblance of what it was and do your best to sort of prove you had like a real good architect on hand and a real good engineer and someone from some sort of historical society where they could look at it and say okay this is what we want to maintain as much of this old stuff as possible while making sure this thing can last for more people to see it I think they could still do that but I have a memo expert but it's a there's plenty of it that you can save and there's things like you know that where's that famous it's in my book it's a picture of the table Kiwanis table there and you've got the tin ceiling that's still there and the floorboards are still there and those are all the same you know the same stuff so I don't know I know expert on it but until the owner because it's his until the owner decides to do something to it come on bro what's his name I think it's Wayne Gibson Gibson come on Wayne it's ridiculous he's a lovely guy I'm sure he doesn't he just doesn't want to do that this is a shape to where the wing yeah giant part of history I mean and particularly after you read this story read your book it's just so much more interesting you know that mean that was the end that was when this guy had become a cattleman that's when this guy had sort of assimilated into not not just assimilated become incredibly successful and you know I want to say Western but Western meaning you know the United States it's not really what I keep using that word probably incorrectly what is the word to use when he was assimilate Eastern no was settler culture like what what would you say when they assimilated to white man's world I would you just say that the white man's world I suppose I guess the white man's world is probably this way Anglo European culture that had come West but yeah very much the white man's world the fact he become a cattleman and become it was hilarious to that they wanted him to not have so many wives they didn't wanted to have the wives and they didn't want to have hit the you know the braids the long long braids I didn't didn't like that didn't like the wives he quanta did things his own way he also played politics brilliantly he mean he understood from the early going that that quote the chief of the Comanches was going to be appointed by the commander at Fort Sill you know it wasn't just going to happen and there were all sorts of candidates jostling for this and he made sure that it was him that didn't make him any less the leader of his tribe it didn't make him any less of an independent person who the white men had to deal with but he made sure he had that one buttoned up and he was challenged continuously I mean there was there were continuous challenge to him it's interesting historically that you don't hear about him and the Comanches when it played such a significant part in taking over the West and settling the West but you hear about Crazy Horse you hear about Sitting Bull you hear about the the Sioux and the Apaches you don't hear that much about the Comanches and you don't hear much about Quanah Parker no it was one of the great pleasures of writing this book is that the these were largely unknown things I mean if you Quanah was one of them another another discovery was you know every we all know about certain people running around San Antonio in the 1830s je Davy Crockett would come to mind but we don't know about Jack Hayes the world's greatest you know the Ranger the guy who sort of invented this anti Comanche warfare invented the repeating you know he first needed an invent but he first used the repeating five-shot pistol and then of course had a hand in the invention of the six-shooter but you know everybody should know who Jack Hayes is everybody should know I mean Kawana was I mean Geronimo is Geronimo and he's famous largely for one particular particular breakout in the late 19th century but you know Quanah was arguably the greater man in in the reservation period and I mean Geronimo in some ways was kind of a was kind of a curmudgeon yeah that was another part that I wanted to get to was Jack Hayes and the creation of the Texas Rangers so we think of the Texas Rangers today think of like Chuck Norris yeah you know you really don't realize that they were essentially a group that was created to effectively combat the Comanche exactly that's where they came from it's amazing the story when when you talk about how it took like sort of several iterations of these guys with before they figured out how to do it right and the guys that came out there essentially a lot like like a lot of depictions of Navy SEALs like renegades yeah like wild rugged rebels and there they are there's the original Texas Rangers is that Jack Hayes in their military very as their case is well the the lightest picture that's him that's right yes oh hey so the thing was of okay San Antonio in the 1830s late 1830s you have you have about 2,000 residents it's the kind of the out the final outpost on the frontier and what what's happening is Texas which now owns the Texas which now owns Texas having won its independence is giving out what they call head rights so if you want to get ahead right meaning free land so all you had to do to get your free land outside of San Antonio was go survey the land so I had to do you had you know home and so the surveyors would go out and survey it and the Comanches would kill them in ever more imaginative ways because the Comanches understood exactly that the instruments did steal the land the instruments were the mechanism of the theft of the land from them and so part the deal was to keep how can you keep your surveyors alive and Hayes was originally a surveyor but he eventually just got good at keeping other surveyors alive and these guys who could do that eventually became known as Rangers and they evolved as Comanche fighters if we know fighting like Comanches did I mean they learned bird signs to track people they would you know make cold camps I mean you never made a warm you never made a campfire if you were around Comanches I mean they would they would they learned these these techniques and techniques of warfare and they got really good at it they've just had this one problem and the problem was that they had three shots yet Kentucky long rifle bang a and two single-shot pistols and that's all they had against Comanches who I would encourage all of your listeners to go and and look up this guy Lars Anderson on the Internet yeah he's the he's the bow guy yeah okay so in him of what he what he proved among other he went back and he just researched it and a lot of the things that I frankly found hard to believe about Comanches once I saw the Anderson videos you believe them yes Anderson can I think it's ten arrows in five seconds he there's no such thing as a quiver you're holding it as a bunch in your harm here I mean but all these things that we you know we heard that the Comanches could do underneath the horse's neck and rapidity of fire and you and no one's ever Comanches never stood in one place and closed one eye as shot and they never once did that they were moving both eyes open anyway look at the Anderson video it's really cool but what that meant was that Jack Hayes and the Rangers were at an enormous disadvantage you know and then lo and behold he yeah well cut to the East Coast this inventor named Samuel Colt had come up in the in the early 1830s with a prototype of a it was a it was a really ingenious little pistol it was a five shot pistol made and eventually made in Paterson New Jersey and it is right there yeah is that the Paterson Colt this is a five shot chamber that was popping up with the same guy so yeah doesn't look like the Paterson coat but anyway it's a five shot it's a five shot thing with with revolving cylinders and as a great idea right absolutely nobody wanted it I mean it was it was like a sidearm for cavalry but the u.s. didn't have a cavalry so it didn't really work out for some reason Mirabeau Lamar the president of Texas ordered a hundred and eighty of these things and they can they found their way to Texas the five-shot Paterson Colts and somehow Jack Hayes and his guys found out about them and they got ahold of them they try and they immediately understood what it meant it meant equalizing the warfare against the Comanches it meant because now they had they had a five shots or one interchangeable cylinder now ten ten shots in Eastern pistol now so in close hand combat the world changed and and not only did that world change but eventually everybody was so stunned by what by this development that the US government ordered a lot of what what ended up being Walker called six-shooters for the Mexican War Colt becomes one of the richest men in America and basically Jack Hazen Rangers redefined warfare which is which is and people said this about Jack Hayes and it's broadly speaking true before Jack Hayes you know people came into the West on foot carrying a Kentucky long rifle and after Jack Hayes they came mounted in carrying a six-shooter yeah that was the other thing that was really shocking was that the US soldiers would try to get off their horse to engage right right because they didn't think you fought mount the only people who fought mounted were the Plains Indians I mean you know nobody thought you've fighting mounted was not something anybody did if you if you used a horse you used it in the Dragoon Way which is you would ride to where you were gonna fight get off the horse and then fight the black Comanches were fully Mountain Rangers were fully mounted and what they what they used the Texas Rangers for in the Mexican War which is they were there was this terrible guerrilla problems and these Rangers just went and cleared out these whole areas and nobody had seen this type of warfare before nobody had seen this kind of ability to fight and move and move mounted and move with these well and nobody had ever seen these what these Walker cult sees five pound hand cannon six shooters that they had nobody had seen those either and so these crazy these these Rangers that dressed any way they wanted to you know sometimes with no shirts on and Serapis and crazy hats I mean there was just the Rangers there everybody was scared to death of it do we know the history of the bow and arrow amongst the Native Americans do we know when it was first implemented I'm not an expert on it I mean I I don't know because I don't know if other if the way the Lars Anderson style of shooting of keeping all the the arrows and the fingers that he researched did he research that from Native Americans or was that ever utilized in Europe or anywhere else his researches I think he started and I'm not an expert on him either but I think he started with other I mean he started reading about you know anybody who were you know who were archers and famous for it and descriptions of them and I believe I'm sure that that did include Native Americans but it was no it was a whole he looked at the whole world and so do you think Native American well we don't know but I'm just speculating did Native Americans develop this ability independently or did they did they learn it from anyone else like it seems interesting that they were livings particularly the Comanches this incredible nomadic life and didn't really have a lot of interaction with other people from other places so for the first interaction from from anywhere else was 16th century Spain yeah yeah and there's there's no that that's the that's the first interaction with Europeans so the question is did the boat come over in the land bridge didn't I I mean I don't know that I really not my field but no of course it's just it's so interesting because I don't know that style of multiple shooting of being able to shoot so many hours in a row had been input I don't think it was implemented by the Europeans maybe the Mongol did they have I don't know the question though the more the question you're getting at is how did the Comanches in particular because when when these Dodge and cattle and these various people saw Comanches in Texas in 1830s they just flat couldn't believe what they were looking at they they couldn't believe their abilities with horses breaking them yeah I'd never seen anything like it before I'd never seen anything like it no saddle either right now the ad the other they did have a cell yeah I think that was part of the Spanish technology very very very minimal you'll see it museums but do you say you can find one of those yeah I'm a Spanish saddle or anyway but yeah they they had and but particularly the the shoe there it is right there Wow very minimal minimal yes and one of the ways they could shoot underneath the the the neck of the horse was to hang a thong off side of one of the saddles but a thong well loop a leather loop a leather loop that would allow them because otherwise they they would need to be supported as they came down underneath them there were fairly small people they were they were fairly small people so they're like they would kind of climb off the saddle and hang on the side on this side full gallop full gallop shooting under the neck accurately arrows that would kill a man at 30 yards underneath the neck but people so the question there I don't know the answer to that and I don't know that anyone does what the white men saw just absolutely floored them with abilities with arrows and among other things they would you know they would make the Indian would ask the Indian voice they set up a dime in a tree or a coin and they go okay now here you stand here and like close your eyes and aim and hit that the Comanche boy would miss it by the foot look at that picture right there of them do that's Aristotle underneath the so basically using the horse as a shield yeah yeah that's the whole idea Wow and there and and if you see them from the other side I've seen trick riders do this you can't even see them mmm from the other side of the horse and again this was something that you know trick riders after you know in the Wild West shows and beyond would do these sorts of things but I'm sorry so I'll go back to what you're saying so when they were standing still oh so where the Comanche boy asked him to like shoot that dime and you can see boy wouldn't hit I mean he was he was - he was playing by their rules they wanted him to stand and aim and whatever and again if you see the Lars Andersson videos there was no such thing as closing one eye there was no such thing almost as standing still and shooting it was constant movement it was you know shooting from movement wherever they were going so and so so we can hear it that way so it was sort of like the member in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid where they say here Sundance try to hit that and and you know Sundance Kid shoots at it and misses it and then on his way out he moves he says you mind if I move or something or I'm better if I move it's the same deal yeah it was all about movement and it was never about anything stationary mm-hmm anyway so you know that that dancer I have no idea how they they got good at that right that's why it's a real shame that they don't have a written history yeah I mean that's one of many many things that's a real shame that they don't have a written history because it's and I would have loved to have seen someone be able to do that I mean God what how incredible would it be to see what what it looked like to see them I mean we're just we just missed the motion picture by 6070 here's gonna think they were doing it for hundreds hundreds and hundreds use it's almost like just too magical to capture sorry it's gone you have gone right before you'd invent a camera no at least we have some photos some still photos we do and we have and I put in pretty big chunks of text into my book of people of the time who saw them and to describe it yeah that's all you can do is yeah this just what they saw and how astounded they were we must have been pretty excited when you saw that Lars Anderson guy oh yeah because you know I pull that guy up show up pull up a video of that guy so we could watch it because it is pretty amazing and because I mean I it's not that I didn't believe what I was reading but on some level it's hard to believe that they can do what the people said they could do it's interesting because this guy gets hated on a lot in the archery community it's very funny because you know they say that a lot of what he's doing is tricks and a lot always doing is nonsense and you know it's not really true that people actually did that but watch him do it yes I said okay ma'am I mean unless that's a trick I mean he's clearly doing what he's saying he's doing there's no if ands or buts about it yeah are they tricks in terms of like is it something that like maybe wouldn't be as effective but it's really cool to see yeah for sure but so what so what he's still showing you yeah he's showing you that you can do things I mean but is he throws a ball and then shoots look at he shoot it was look at that he shoot it in the head with his people also the rate of discharge which was one of the things I had trouble believing he when you see him shoot he's just yeah one every time throws it catches it and he can shoot an arrow like after right after he catches it look at that how he throws something in the air and then shoots two shots - he throws it in the air and then by the time it hits the ground he hits it twice means incredible and he's really accurate with this thing he also one of his cases is that you know that he is always moving it's continuous movement he never he doesn't close one eye he doesn't stand still he is moving all the time yeah where he goes which is what he said was a trademark of the great the Magyars and the great you know Archer cultures look at this jumps in the air gets off an arrow before he hits the ground I mean amazing and he's even catching arrows and then shooting them back like anybody that says that what he's doing is nonsense is a fool like look he's mainly doing it you're in you are an archer yeah archery range back then okay so you've got it I'm a bow under yeah well okay that's how this is really impressive stop for me I don't shoot traditional archery I shoot a compound bow with a sight and I can line it up to the exact yardage and all that stuff but but I know enough to know that what this guys doing it's pretty special so he's showing arrows in the quiver versus arrows in his hand how he can just grab him and pull him right so his his case is that we all think that it's a quiver right he says nobody nobody was any good ever used to quiver you can transport them in a quiver but in battle you're holding them in a bunch of a clustered bunch in your hand I was saying these people here in these ancient depictions the actual drawings from you know hundreds of years ago of the way he did it holding the arrows in his draw hand and so he can do it very quickly really interesting it is really and this is probably I mean because of this one gentleman it's probably the only way we're really gonna know that this was possible cuz no one else is doing anything like this guy look at this guy he's doing drive-bys on a back of a bike and he hits I mean back that up again so you could see that because that is insane watch how he's doing this right there I mean three times he hits in in a second he hits three targets on a bike as he's riding by which would emulate a horse other difference between the elevation change you know you go up and down on a horse but that was the other thing about like the stories of the Mongols that they had developed an ability to shoot as the horses in the air because it wouldn't like the the stomping oh I say hubs would during that part so as the horse was up that's when they would release so it would have the least amount of impact on their their accuracy pretty incredible stuff but it's one of the things that made Comanches Comanches the mastery of the horse Plus that would now combine with this ability to shoot from from a moving horse now did they have a particular prowess with archery that was was known amongst Native Americans what was extraordinary amongst other tribes I don't know that for a fact but I do know the reaction of people who saw them who had seen plenty of other Indians nobody had ever seen anything like it at the time now was there a group in of Northern Plains Indians that could do I don't know but but the reaction was almost universal by people who had seen a lot of Indian tribes and you know they'd never seen that before someone needs to make a movie yeah you know I mean someone really is someone really needs to make a movie about Cynthia Ann Parker about Quanah about the Comanche just about what it must have been like for these poor hapless settlers that didn't know they're being used as a meat buffer you know the whole story mean well you know Warner Brothers has been working on this for nine years so yeah I would maybe one day we can't they came very as I understand it very soon this book came out nine years ago right so that's when Warner Brothers was right and the first screenwriter was Larry McMurtry it was very famous you know if you had to pick a screenwriter who would be Larry McMurtry and Hollywood well you know you're in the middle of the you're in the belly of the beast here you know what it's like it it Hollywood is just does what it does I mean there are two modes here I think hair on fire and glacier and I've been through both of them maybe we get your hair on fire again but we know we've got a great screenplay now and I did I didn't write but you know Derek C and Frances the director has been happy with the dog I am extremely I didn't think it was possible to do a two-hour movie about that yeah so what they did is they basically made it about McKenzie in quanta it's just flat brilliant so and I think as as I'm told even though I wasn't part of it they came pretty close last summer to doing this but the budget was too high and the budget was so high I think that they thought that the only way they could make their money back as if they had Batman or Wonder Woman in it but that might wreck the atmosphere so but yeah I'd love to see it get done in it so it's a wonderful screenplay and we'll see no listen it's more than that it's it's an amazing book and I can't recommend it enough you know it's just it changed the way I felt and thought about the whole this whole thing of these settlers traveling across the country and encountering these Native American tribes it changed my home which completely changed my whole perspective of that era in time well it's that the needle sort of swings both ways on this on the question of a Native Americans and there as I said there was a there was sort of a school that was dominant well if you actually go back you you have kind of a mid-century impression that you know sort of the Indians are all bad and the Army is good right the Cavalry's riding out right that kind of idea of Indians mm-hmm and then you have the beret my heart at Wounded Knee which is a needle swinging the other way then is these people are victims the Army is all evil yeah which wasn't true either and it kind of swings it swings between one untruth to another untruth but the actual truth is some is somewhere in the middle oh you and you do a great job of depicting that like you talk about the horrific crimes that particular army people did yes yeah yeah so there's no in my book I'm I objectively speaking both sides are responsible for atrocities and you know one of the things the Rangers learned was no quarter you know no quarter isn't you know when you when you if you if you can imagine all the way into an attack on an Indian village as men women and children in and imagine what no quarter looks like it's not very pretty and that was certainly Comanche way of doing things and that was the Texas Rangers way of doing things when fighting Comanches so yeah you have you have and any number of great massacres perpetrated against against while Comanches and other Indian tribes yeah it's I mean it's it's amazing I can't recommend it enough well thank you have you thought about writing any other books on Native Americans or is there any other subjects like this you'd like to tackle you know I I I would have probably this book became very successful and then there was a wave of other books that there were really not very many books at all before it about this particular native culture but then there was a big wave of them after right afterward which inspired by the success of this book and a good was oh yeah yeah let's see the center of everything that is the heart of everything that is which is which is a version well not a version but it was a it was a kind of doing for the Sioux what what this book did so that might have been a choice of mine for example would be to go hey I'll do the Sioux and Northern Plains Indians won't that be great but there were some books like that but one heart in the heart of everything that is is is it very I would recommend that one there was another book actually they came out just before by called blood and thunder that's quite good but but uh anyway there that it it it preempted me on some of the choices I might have made but I'd like to return to it I've been in the Civil War now for a few years and yeah writing about the Civil War I have a new book out called hymns of the Republic about the final year of the war I wrote a biography of Stonewall Jackson and so I've been kind of I took I took a right turn actually because this book was very successful let me sometimes when you're successful a window opens and maybe it's never going to open again and that window in this case was that I could maybe do what I wanted to do and so I picked Stonewall Jackson just because I want to do so well Jackson and so that made me a right-angle turn into the Civil War where I've been for a while what I'd loved answers I'd love to return to of America well it's a whole genre of film in this country which is so interesting right the West Wild West movies means a gigantic genre of course Clint Eastwood and so many other great movies yeah even the Civil War it's like there's so many story what we're trying to tell this insane story of what this country was and what it became and how quickly it all happened you know it's so hard for us when you you're born me me I was born in the East Coast you know you live around cities seems normal and then you start hearing about the West and then you start like as you're growing up you start learning about cowboys and Indians and what habit you get this sort of weird version of it where I mean in in high school they'd barely taught you anything no nothing comprehensive nothing any no anything remotely touching on your book and then as I got older and I started getting in it more and more it became this really weird puzzle to me until I read your book and your book was actually listened to it on audio tape and it was one of the most sort of paradigm-shifting well it just it's completely shifted my perspective on and how it happened well I'm glad it's various did that right here it was it is it is a bit of I mean I think from my point of view it's a bit of me being too dumb or naive to know any better I mean I just went in as a reporter and reported without any particular agenda not because I'm a noble person but just because I just didn't have any agenda I just reported the book and I thought this is interesting and this is interesting and and just laying that out actually means you're avoiding these sort of ideological extremes that you know that of whatever it may be that that is painting a picture that isn't quite accurate for some other reason so anyone has anybody written a good book on Crazy Horse not that I could Larry McMurtry wrote a pretty good book about Crazy Horse a small volume I'm trying to remember there was a book a few years about crazy ores but anyway the memory book is pretty good yeah so but so basically so you may go back back to this sort of subject I may if I could find if I could find you know the right subject so Jack Hayes was something I could still go back Jack Hayes was a really interesting guy yeah it seemed like when you were talking about in the book like this could be a whole nother Avenue that you could take second see going back to Kay's because he he continues to intersect with Native America all all through his life anyway so it was just the whole idea of going from a surveyor to protecting surveyors to becoming the original Texas Ranger which is one of the main Texas Rangers one of the most iconic groups of humans in the history of this country he was the uber ranger he was the man you affect five foot eight five foot nine slender the high voice man let's say bad and he had all these you know these giant Rangers really mean people I mean these were the people you did not want to pick the fight with in the western bar you know complete deference yeah well that was what was fascinating about is like they had put together these sort of outcasts and those are the ones that were able to do the job and not only able but they nobody else would do it I mean these were 23 year old guys who didn't have families and it just didn't give a shit about anything they were happy to be out in the field for six months without pay which was often true I mean they often just didn't get paid they weren't they weren't armed they weren't paid they weren't any there's just and they wanted to fight Indians I mean honey only 41 year olds you know willing to do that you know this is such a wild group of humans you know yeah I really do hope you write a book about that well that would be a I've often thought of pursuing that one and that gets into other Native American areas so well listen man I mean just what just being able to talk about it on here I'm hoping that it gives it a boost again well thank you for whatever I'm so glad you like it it it's it's a great subject and it it in some ways I think the reason I maybe was mainly attracted to it is it told you what happened in the American West on some level through this one lens you which is pretty cool you knocked another park man thank thank you coming here really all right you thank you appreciate bye everybody [Music] well that was painless thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]
