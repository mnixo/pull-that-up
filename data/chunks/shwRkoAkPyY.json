three two one Jon Ronson welcome back Joe it's good to be back good to see you again very good to be back what's happening man how you been I've been good I was floating around this neighborhood yeah I've spent a year on porn sets [Laughter] research most research it was a lot my wife did say to me once a twisty really that you really have to go to another person it just made I've just finished making a series for audible called the butterfly effect and the flap of the butterfly's wings which I'm dressing throughout the series is it's this young man called baby 'n who's like a tech nerd in brussels and he has the idea to get rich from giving the world free porn so free streaming porn so the series is about the kind of tech takeover of porn in the valley I mean know that that's really real oh no this one's everywhere yeah no that was back that was back in the day that's like in the 90s oh so Fabian Fabian gave the world pornhub okay that's fiction no no this is this is so true so okay let me go back okay so in the 90s right this kid called Fabian good like Fabian tilman so a young boy in brussels was like a tech nerd would like go on CompuServe and swap pole and password so get porn for free which is how people got porn for free back in the 90s and then he had like a sort of Eureka moment which is I can I can give the world YouTube for porn right so he bought up this fledgling company in Montreal called it was called ma'am safe at the time was run by these two brought this up in Montreal and they just invented pornhub fabian porter pornhub and then kind of overnight single-handedly took over the valley there it's an extraordinary story this massive flow of money went from where we are now in the valley a community of people who were making pretty good money from porn the money just load into Fabian's pocket because what fabian did was well look if you're if you're a porn star and you go to a bank and say can I have a checking did you see a porn star a porn ster a porn well I said a porn star but actually I'm brilliant many porn stars anymore if you're a porn person and you go to a bank and you say can I have a checking account the bank manager will usually say no because you're in porn which means you're disreputable really yes people like me people like story written about this a lot about how they found it really hard to get mortgages how'd they find it hard to get checking accounts what checking accounts that seems unlikely I mean I would believe that maybe mortgages they would think that your your business is fairly unstable that kind of makes sense as far as an investments in concern and also the idea that other people other customers might not like the idea that their high street bank is being shared with somebody who's in porn really yeah it's got reputational risk Wow that seems really dumb to me yeah I mean I sense at all right well sure but Fabian was making money from running a site that dealt in the in in piracy so basically fans would upload porn illegally onto pornhub mm-hmm so Fabian's running the site that was filled with pirated content Fabian went to a bank to say I want to expand but because he wasn't ostensibly a porn person he was a tech person who was deemed to be respectable this bank gave him a three hundred and sixty two million dollar loan to expand to build an empire based in purse on the handling of stolen porn so we went to the valley who already kind of paranoid there all their porn was being stolen and put up onto pornhub and he bought up all the you know loads of companies that cut price right because the companies were like panicking I wanted to sell and certainly Fabian just single-handedly like took over porn so I want and nobody cares about that was thinking about the consequences of that because Fabian was given the world what they wanted to it was free porn but I was really curious to know let me pause there you said no one cares about it no but a lot of people did it was a huge issue and there was a lot of like moral debate around like that boom well be you know there's a lot of the girls that were in porn that we're really pissed off because they weren't making any money anymore and they were there's a lot of social media posts about it's imploring people to stop using these sites oh yo and listen to exactly I mean some people cat yeah you know porn consumers didn't well it was a it was an interesting tech like a moral tech debate that was going on for a while but then what the debate is lost I mean there was a it's really interesting because there was a guy who lived down the street from me and he was a big-time porn producer and I actually knew him from my jujitsu class and he was a real high Rolland sort of character like he always had this beautiful mercedes-benz and he wore these really big watches a lot of you know fancy clothes and he was just making just tons of money and if this here this beautiful house and he was just this baller character and then it all dried up quick yeah lost his house his house got repossessed yeah and Fabian got so rich because of this because the money went from the orphans pocket into Fabian's pocket Fabian got so rich there how's he getting rich off for free streaming so their ads winners partly because of ads but partly because he brought up the paid sites as well so you know because the paid sites were like panicking because they were losing all their money to piracy we bought up the competition he bought it redtube he bought it youporn so he bought up all the competition to pawn her but he also bought loads of paid sites and went Playboy TV so your friend got so poor that his house got repossessed Fabian got so rich that he installed in his house an aquarium that was so big there a diver that to come every week and dive in and clean the coral reef wow you know you're doing well when you get your own that's weird yeah so yeah you write porn people care to love but the outside world didn't care because you know the outside world doesn't care where music's getting pirated so it shows hell don't care when it's porn well they care a little bit about the music thing but the porn thing got almost no traction and when the porn industry essentially for the most part collapsed or at least there was a massive amount of loss there was no talk about like some sort of a bailout or anything silly like that I was like no that industry is gone right in an act like many other industries were bailed out and when you look at our smaller right when you look at that headquarters up in Montreal the company that owned porn up it's not poor day its techie so you're walking fabien actually said to me quite tellingly he said yes he said it was amazing you wouldn't even know that we were in porn unless you went to the wrong floor no he seems like a guy who's well aware of his crime yeah I mean Famers say if it wasn't me it'd be somebody else I mean it sounds like a good thing to say after you kill somebody I did say it's progress you'd call it progress but it's but he's a criminal I mean it's it's essentially he's lucky that he's dealing in pirated stuff right the one time Fabian got annoyed with me he was quite game like I wanted to I wanted to interview him and then I wanted to travel to the valley to look at the consequences untraced consequence due to consequence like where would I end up if I just because I think people don't think about consequences on the internet that much they want to just you know destroy somebody and then carry on with their day as I want so story about consequence is that the only time Fabian got annoyed with me was when either me or my quasar director said to him you know you uploaded pirated porn and he said no I didn't I've never uploaded pirated porn I offer a service in which of the people can upload pirated porn and if they tell us to take it down we'll take it down which was they have to find it they have to find it and also there's so much fucking free porn and Paul yeah there is like cutting down a forest with a butter knife it's in possible - yeah you know you can you can say take down my power to portly I'll say okay sorry phone but then there's like a million other people's read porn up there anyway yeah so actually it's funny I don't by the way what I'm about to say shouldn't be construed as me saying that I think that Fabian is a psychopath because I don't but that thing about not taking responsibility for your own actions I just remembered I wrote a book a few years ago about Psychopaths called the psychopathy test and a psychopathic trait is that like if somebody kills somebody in a bar they would say well it's his fault for looking at me funny so failure to accept responsibility for own actions is one of the twenty items on the Psychopaths do you think he's a psychopath or do you think it's some sort of a convenient neglecting of certain responsibility for what happened he I don't think baby and that was very much the time central thing because I don't think Fabian is a psychopath at all but I think that tech people have created a sort of a moral bubble around themselves I'd talked to the head of porn hubs mobile division so if you've ever watched he's called Brandon if you've ever watched porn hub on your mobile you have Brandon to thank and I said to Brandon burner said like we never like 99% of pornhub employees never set foot on a porn set and he said that's good because you know we're designing you know we're search engine people we're you know we all want to say India it would be sort of unpleasant to set for the porn set it would be sort of intimidating and unpleasant and I said well maybe maybe would have been good if more porn her people did set foot on porn sets because she would be able to see the negative consequences of your business plan and Brendan went their livelihood which again is a very tacky thing to say right because it's all about it's all about progress their livelihood yeah what did you mean by that like okay now you want to talk about their livelihood so their livelihood people yeah but I mean they're they're essentially like content provider that's not paying for any content yeah and yeah so yeah I just remembered a guy called David Lowery who's a who's a he's and he's interested in kind of piracy issue in in music and he said when we look back on the dystopian movies of the 1930s well you know machines would take over metropolis or something like the mole of the film that the climax of the film is when the people the humans defeat say you know I we're not gonna live in a world run by machines we're gonna defeat the machines and human morality will take over but now that machines are ruling the world instead of us defeating the machines we are adapting our morality to fit in with the machines capability so because it is easy to pirate instead of saying let's not pirate we're just adapting a morality and say ok we can watch / - poets guy yeah but it's not as simple as pirating because pirating is what everybody does on you know when when they're sharing it through message boards or you know what have you that's sort of pirating right when they're uploading it to these websites and servers and stuff but what what he's doing is massively profiting off of other people's work it's a little bit of a more of a gray area yeah I'd say so he's not even gray it's kind of dark when he certainly profited hugely from other people pirating you know their favorite porn films onto his side has he been sued he got into he got arrested for tax evasion and that's how he got out of the business eventually but I think that all got that all got solved I'm not sure if he ever got sued like because if somebody says to him if somebody said to him that take down my you know bad babysitter's volume two is mine I say that one because I was actually on the set of bad babysitter's volume two mmm he'd say oh sure yeah sorry of course and it would go down but then maybe somebody else would put it up later that day or you know and it didn't matter because everything else was free I tell you one amazing consequence of all of this though so what I wanted to do in this audible series at the butterfly effect was to kind of trace the consequences of this lie you know what was the tornadoes that were being created and one amazing consequence is like Fabian surrounded himself with tech wizards like people who knew how the internet worked including a lot of search engine people so instead of making porn films like they made in the 90s this porn director Mike quasar said to me that the first film he ever made back in the 90s was called Women of Influence now all the porn films have to be easily searchable it's like a kind of arms race of search engine optimization like to get yourself up the Google rankings so all the porn films in the valley aren't called Women of Influence because how do you search for that they're there they basically see what the most popular search terms are and then make films based on that so Mike quasar was telling me this on the set of the film he was shooting that day which was stepdaughter cheerleader orgy so I said so I said oh just it's just around the corner from here so I said to Mike so are there because I thought about like Women of Influence versus stepdaughter cheerleader Audrey mm-hmm I'd look I haven't seen Women of Influence so for all I know the moral of Women of Influence is that women shouldn't have influence but my guess is that Women of Influence is a more kind of holistic porn film than stepdaughter cheerleader oh gee so I said to Mike are there any people in the valley who like conch at work because they're just not a keyword and might one yeah like every asshole porn actress now between the ages of 23 and 29 can't get work because they're not a teen and they're not a MILF they're like in this sort of fallow periods between teen and milf when they're just attractive and just attractive isn't a searchable term so if you're not a teen and you're not a MILF if you're like a 26 year old adult film actress you can't get work you just have to lie well I said to Mike what do you do do you just like sit there until you like become a milf become employable again and the answer is they have to find other ways to make money so escorting is going through the roof in the valley yeah because of the tech because people have fabian because the tech taker throws porn escorting is going through the roof but also another thing that's going through the roof is this kind of weirdly adorable world of bespoke porn yeah and that's what the article were what was the publication who published that article is the Guardian I did like a written version of one of the episodes of the show I just stumbled upon it you know knowing that you're gonna be here I didn't even know you wrote it I was reading it and as I was like oh John wrote this right it's what an amazing did you know about this world no and you're right in porn 1/2 in the valley so yeah it's a pretty hip sort fascinating explain what it is like people literally will request some of the most bizarre things yeah these people will make custom films based on their weird kinks just for them like a team of professional porn people because the valleys suffering so much because there's porn opens oh my we'll make an entire porn film just for you now how much does something like this cost like say if you wanna what makeup film about girls were in Mutant Ninja Turtle outfits who kick guys in the balls like that's entirely possible right yeah oh yeah anything's possible but that sounds like something this might actually sell yeah oh yeah they've got like a couple of thousand dollars that's it yeah couple grand yeah Wow I got so obsessed with the world of bespoke porn because it was such a fascinating window into people's inner lives yeah one of the first ones I saw was with a condiments video like ketchup and the ocean so it's it's a woman sitting in there in a you know like a child's paddling pool and out of shot what are the bespoke porn producers is pouring industrial sized tubs of condiments on her hair dried mustard and what and the woman's like right here you know she's beat she's lying Gabe so she's got oh it's so cold and slimy and so far anyway the guy who commissioned this video the producers knew one thing about him he's a restaurant who deals with continents every day oh yeah and has to you know presumably avoid situations like that happening in his restaurant so he just sits around thinking like as like customers hitting down a little squirt her with some mayonnaise well maybe it's stress maybe it's like oh my god if this type of mayonnaise falls right we're all fucked dude yeah we're doomed didn't like that be like the cleaning pill and maybe it's like maybe his releases to do this Wow another one was a Norwegian man has spent 40 years amassing of a valuable stamp collection and his bespoke porn film was to send his stamp collection to the valley where three naked porn women would destroy his stamp collection yes Baker there's a still for it yeah how much does a stamp collection worth well lie well it turns out because we managed to track down stamps man and he talked to us after a lot of persuasion and he's got 10 books of stamps and once a year he sends one to a custom preset and three does it would say yeah so that's his thing yeah it turns out it's because he grew up in Iceland where stamp collecting was a very popular hobby at the time in like the 70s and the 80s stamp collecting was big so he became like an obsessive stamp collector the stamp shop owners would say oh if you buy this standards can be very valuable in 20 years but then came the internet and it like killed off the stamp it killed off stamp collecting as a hobby like you know ya nerds apparently felt like other other things to be interested in and you know the thrill of the chase just wasn't there anymore like you can ease keep oh yeah so anyway so his stamps lost all of their value this stores closed down that kind of collegiate atmosphere of fellow stamp collectors just vanished he began to like you know regret his life choices of like spending all of that time and money collecting stamps he began to feel depressed and isolated so he went to see a psychiatrist who told him that stamp collecting is a ridiculous hobby because it isolates him so now he pays porn people to destroy his dance the psychiatrist told him that our hobby is religious yep according to him I'm not never talk to the psychiatrist but according to him yeah he said that stamp collecting is a ridiculous hobby that seems like a ridiculous thing for a psychologist to say sounds just yeah bad psychology yeah if someone enjoys it yeah if you're if you have all your ducks in a row and everything's firing on all cylinders but you really truly enjoy stamps who's whose to tell you there's something wrong with that well the only I mean one good thing that came out of it was he he really enriched the imaginations of the people in the valley and also my imagination - I mean stamps now because all the custom produces talk you know alright and stumps man was such a mystery to them all so you know so at least he destroys the stamps now in a way that's beneficial to him yes really yeah isn't it amazing but it's all weird right well it's also quite sad we Dan and Rhiannon who made one of the stamps videos called us just as we were finishing our series and Rhiannon was in tears and it just had a request and the request was for a guy I got I wanted a porn woman to sit cross-legged on the floor fully clothed and say into the camera you are loved things may be bad now but they won't always be and suicide is not the answer yeah so then they they thought what do we do so they told him they'd make the video for him and they could shoot it really soon and he didn't he didn't respond so they made it anyway and we were there to record and and it was fair it made me realize just how kind of delightful the the bespoke porn world is because they were so eager to help this guy did he show himself we don't know they made the video for him the woman did the pornstar Riley was saying into the camera you know I have thought about dying too but I came out of that hole you know when I came back stronger and now I can see all the good in the world and Riley was crying and Rihanna and the producer was crying and they sent the video to the guy and we don't know you know it's interesting there's quite a few porn stars on Twitter that have like you know really like kind of motivational Twitter feeds like they say nice things they say positive things there they seem like healthy people yeah and if you separate the fact that that they have sex on film for a living take that out of the mix and what you have is like looks like your average person who's trying to do better in this world and is sharing positive things that they find that gives them inspiration and moves them along in a certain way and but then you add the sex thing and for whatever reason we have this weird hang-up about sex it's because we all fucked up I talked to this girl called dick coat who was part of a radical honesty group a radical honest if you come across radical honesty no I don't think so you would love it I might be in one I don't even know it could I take a radical okay well the first time I ever heard about radical honesty was my friend Stanley Cohen at the podcaster who went on a radical honesty group and one of the things you have to do is on a podcast yeah she does a podcast called mystery show she's to be on this American Life OK anyway so she went to a radical honesty group where you have to be like radically honest to each other so at how it starts I've been torn as well it starts with everybody's sitting in a circle and they have to confess to the room a secret about themselves that they've never told anyone so the one that sterling went to the first guys my secret is that I haven't paid taxes in 10 years and so everyone went oh and then the next guy said my secret is that I killed a man whoa yeah he said I was in a truck I was driving a truck and I kicked the passenger out of the truck and he fell onto the road and he got run over and I got away with it and nobody you know nobody knows that it was murder so then the next person in the circle when well my my secret so it'll be disappointing compared to that she said I suppose I can tell you that I have sex with my cat so then the murderer kind of put his hand up and said it was disgusting No so can I add something to my who should be shaming yourself quite the opposite he said could I add something to my secret he said I also have sex with my cat so hey yeah I'm one-upper yeah he had to like he had to be the best secret in the room he might be a bullshitter oh so it's possible yeah that's part of the problem with those yeah I should say by the way I met Brad Blanton the guy who runs his radical honesty groups and I asked him whether Stanley's story was true and he said yes the way she described that circle is what happened but so I was at this radical honesty group in his church school in New Orleans and this girl called Dakota said that her secret was that she was she's like this young church girl she said her secret was actually watched porn so I said what did you you know what she watched it on and she said porn her because this is how like every child in the world learns about sex these days and I said did you ever get so into it that you would like learn their names she'd say oh there's James Dean and she said no no no she kind of laughed and she said no I never learned their names it's like when you kill a deer you don't name it because then he can't eat it so this is what the porn people are up against right it's this shame of of the of the viewer it's like in in hypocrisy lies exploitation which is why somebody like Fabian can come in and get a 300 million dollar loan and take over porn it's because we don't want to think about it because it makes us feel bad about ourselves but that sort of thing but her her issue is like church-going plus female mmm whereas men they have very specific tastes and they tend to gravitate towards very specific porn stars like one of the things that I've noticed that really popular porn stars will have like gigantic numbers on like social media Twitter or Instagram like upwards of a million yeah you know and maybe more like and so they obviously have like a following you know yeah you know you said that a lot of poem women on Twitter that kind of a positive indicator intervention or messages one of the reasons why that is I met this porn woman called may seem a who was like really depressed another of Fabian's consequences is that like kids grow up on on pornhub these days so there's no longer the kind of outlaw status about coming to the valley to do porn that they used to be in like the 80s and 90s now you know the valleys like flooded with women who you know they turn 18 they watch porn out they think that looks cool and then they come to the valley and and a negative consequence of that is that they get worked for like a couple of weeks and then you know there's loads more women off the bus and so the producers don't need to employ them anymore so there's a massive turnaround they get worked for a few weeks and then it's over so I met this woman called may seem a who was in that funk like she came in May throughout May she was working I met her in July and the work her just dried up and she was like venting on Twitter and then she stopped venting and then all of her tweets were like I'm so happy it's such a beautiful day and I said why did you stop venting on Twitter and she said well a bunch of porn producers told me it looked bad for my brand ly you know they don't you know I'm they don't want a sort of miserable poor person saying I'm not getting work today they want a poun person who says here's a picture of my butt yeah and isn't that unhealthy right this is what we've turned Twitter and we've turned it into this thing when we're not allowed to to be ourselves or to tell the truth about ourselves the well in this particular example maybe but I mean I think it's an inherently for whatever reason in in my estimation and many others a depressing business I don't yeah and I don't know why I mean for a lot of people the idea of a young girl going into porn is depressing you know like I have daughters the idea of my daughter's going into porn is very depressing hmm you know but I've met porn stars that seem nice they seem happy so I mean but why is it that it's everybody wants to have sex but if you have sex on film yeah and everybody gets to watch the shame yeah yeah sweet it's a weird a little side effect of our civilization it's the shame coming in from from the outside looking in there's no shame when I was on the set of stepdaughter cheerleader orgy was quite close to where we are now probably like a mile away from here but up in the hills and it was a kind of familial bubble like it's almost been nice to each other right happy but Mike the director needed to get an establishing shot of the cheerleaders arriving home from cheerleader practice so we went outside they were wearing their cheerleader outfits and some teenagers had caught on to what was happening but a porn film was being shot like up on a nearby hill and they were like catcalling and hissing and sort of mocking these girls and for the first time not just the girls but the cameraman the director everybody suddenly felt like self-conscious and the girls were like you know sort of depend on westerns so until the mucking Outsiders came along it was healthy and shame free but as soon as an outsider started hissing at them it became shameful and I think that's that's that's porn for you like most of the problems that porn people face are stigma from the outside not from the community itself which be quiet respectful and the people that were mocking them first of all they're young right teenagers and second of all they're probably thinking of it in terms of like almost like they're online yeah yeah I mean like one of the things about online is there's no consequences for what you're saying and then people have no problem shitting on people we couldn't see them we could only hear them mmm I was looking looking up and I couldn't see them because they were on like a ridge about the house yes it's almost like being anonymous yeah yeah I mean anonymous people online it's the behaviors very bizarre because like sometimes I'll see people's comments whether it's to me or to somebody else and they're so fucking vicious and nasty over nothing to say but nothing over nothing yeah you know over you know someone's movie that they did or some album that they did or whatever it was and just shitting all over every aspect of their person just almost just to try to get them to hurt the way they're hurting you know that's almost what it seems like it's like you're just like super angry bitter person it's just life is just throwing rocks at them everywhere they go and every chance they get to throw a rock back they do yeah that Randy Niemann song I just want you to hurt like I do mmm yeah I'd say this certainly an element to that there's also an element of what the right call was that phrase at the right use all the time virtually signaling which I don't like using that phrase because it's so been kind of adopted by this sort of you know white nationalists but that's but it exists you know I hurt you signaling is absolutely real I see it all the time I see it all the time it's usually like really really weak men you know they're like trying really hard to court the favor of women and they're not attractive and they're not desirable and so they try really hard to be allies yeah the last time I was here I I just don't fill all of that as it was out of my public shaming book coming out oh yeah I'm like a sort of small group of people decided to sort of try and angry at you screw ya wrong think you were guilty of wrong think yeah I just read a story this morning in vulture about the young adult world where this book came out called called the black witch and it said it's a liberal book as a young adult book that's a liberal book is a progressive book but it contains racist characters so a blogger took some of the quotes that the racist characters said in the book it's about radical quote certainly and took them out of context yeah page 163 the Celts are not a pure Rayz like us they're more accepting of intermarriage and because of this they're hopelessly mixed so that's a quote from the book and then the blog wrote underneath yes you read that with your own two eyes this is one of the times my jaw drops in horror and I had to walk away from this book so then how noble so then like hundreds and hundreds of people like powered in on the book and then Kirkus gave this book a good review and then people powered in on Kirkus Turkish Turkish is like this industry is that when you write a book one of the first reviews he gets from Kirkus it's like it's an industry all that word ki RK us okay and if you get like a starred Kirk because she feels like a big deal and so they powered in on coke or didn't get a good review but noticed two things happened as a result of this one was actually it didn't seem to affect the books success the book is doing well like on Amazon and people actually read the book I'm offended by it and same thing up and with my books they'd been publicly shamed like the code of you know people trying to turn against the book it didn't well the numbers are so small you had numbers of twats that are actually out there beating the bushes for this stuff when you're talking about you know a few thousand people at or whatever or a few hundred maybe even very vocal yeah and if there's anyone particularly upset at you it might just be there's there's many instances where people are attacked by one person and that person assumes multiple identities online I had a body mine who's do someone was doing that yeah it's just it's it's real common like they're just for whatever reason just single you out and maybe you wrote something that you know they found personally offensive or but the thing that drives me crazy about that about this taking out of context this character who's a racist character is you were talking about fiction and if fiction if you can't portray realistic humans I mean there are racists just but how come you're allowed to make a fictional character about a murderer or about you know some sort of a you know Nazi type character or something long like how come that's okay I mean these are like you know these I think are kind of young kids because this is the why a world and I you know they're not thinking why a young adult type of publishing and you know they're not thinking it through they're they're not thinking this well they're just seeing an opportunity to be outraged you know that you know the expression recreational outrage yeah man so but the other thing that happened as a result of this so the book itself apparently isn't being particularly negatively affected even though the the outrage was was huge probably help so possibly but the journalists from this vulture article interviewed publishers who basically a segment we're telling our authors you know just you know us having a chilling effect on unlawful don't put in like if the author's white don't try and put in a person of color as a cat just it's not worth it you know just don't do it so actually these new roles these are new roles a few years out you notice wrote this I've been writing movies lately and and and I always try and put in characters of color and because I think okay you know maybe a director will kind of ignore it but if I put that into a screenplay then there's a good chance that a person of color is gonna get offered you know a role but now suddenly I'm being told like that's not that's not good I shouldn't do that well you'd be told you're being told you shouldn't do that because you need to stay in your lane yeah well I'm not being told it but I'm reading this article where I read that novelists are being told well this is a different situation you know talking about an offensive character you should probably clarify that oh yeah no of course ya know what you're talking about is someone's telling you not to do or maybe you shouldn't do a person of color in your screenplay because that's not your place yeah writers are being told according to this felt rascal that today writers are being told not to do it oh of course not not like right that's a different thing yeah it could easily be misconstrued yeah I don't want to let anybody take you out of context there right yeah no of course and and that feels like a very short role it is yeah well it's just again it's it's just the left is turning on itself I mean there are people that are turning on them so there you cannot be progressive enough there is no one out there that's progressive enough and so there's always gonna be someone to find some fault in something that you do particularly if you're doing fiction that portrays realistic scenarios that could easily exist in any city and in me in any you know civilization on earth yeah and I noticed when when you know because I was covering all of this for a couple of years I was writing so you've been publicly shamed tonight and I noticed like every time somebody like Justine Sacco got kind of got got on the Internet Breitbart Infowars male innopolis poor Joseph Watson Alex Jones you know they would propagandize the hell out of this stuff and this was in the run-up to Trump getting elected and I can't help thinking that the left eating itself it's part of the reason why we've got trampled you they fucked up for sure they became unreasonable yeah I mean there's a meme that's going out there that I've seen on many many different places on Instagram and Twitter and stuff it says this kind of shit is why I got elected and it's Trump like pointing yeah at the camera I think it's true you know it's a hundred percent true people are fed up I mean they they're fed up and they you know they didn't realize what the consequences are you know what's really fascinating is I saw this article today where I was talking about America was on CNN about Americans like in general like everyone polled does not like the fact that Trump tweets it was some crazy number people think that he should stop tweeting but one of the things that got him elected is the fact that he tweets said people enjoyed it like here's a guy who's fighting back and he's not he's not scared to hit back with personal insults and like we'd never seen that before from someone running for president like this was stunning yeah you know but and then he became president everybody's like well he'll surely let that go once he's in the office cuz that's not presidential but he used an expression you know I forget the expression with something like it's modern presidential right yeah why yeah I remember the very first talk I ever did for they'd been publicly sharing there's this woman in front row this kind of elderly lady this was at the bookshop Santa Cruz and she was like pointedly shaking her head and disagreements with everything that I was saying and then when it came to the Q&A I said I couldn't got any questions and she went she said I said okay I just said if you play she said if you play with the Twitter toy that it's your fault if you get burned well I'm what I said to her was like you know it's influences beyond Twitter like Twitter is Twitter is infecting the culture and it's an it infected everything what began on Twitter a new type of discourse in a new way of seeing each other infected politics culture the mainstream media it's infected everything in the same way that I wonder whether Fabian F is sort of feels a bit guilty about some of the consequences of his business plan I wonder whether it's some of the twitter executives ever feel guilty about what they've done well they certainly feel like they have some sort of responsibility which is why they're silencing certain people and I don't know if shadow banning is real but there's there's all this talk of people being shadow banned and you know and then a lot of people have had their accounts suspended yeah so they are doing a bit of stuff now yeah how does a member megin from the Westboro Baptist Church helps yeah he's a friend of mine and she oh she came on yourself yeah she wasn't great she's amazing she's so great fascinating that someone who came from such a horrible regressive environment became just like fascinating really intelligent really well-spoken sensitive person yeah you know I think mekin would say if she was sitting here because I kind of said that too at one time and she said it goes to show that you know fool for that sort of hateful beliefs my parents were good parents like they gave me this positive stuff as well as the negative Wow amazing she can't even talk to them anymore yeah they won't talk to her we won't talk to her I think she went up to them at a picket of David Bowie's memorial they wouldn't talk to her they wouldn't look her in the eye anyways anyways she was on the phone to Twitter one time she tell me because they love it I mean Twitter loved her because she hadn't she sort of got talking to liberals on Twitter and that's great that's what persuades her out of the Westboro Baptist Church so for Twitter that's like the best story in the world so she was talking to twister she told me they wanted her to do a talk and she said oh you know she did was talk as well Jon Ronson and she said she said Twitter went quiet so they're upsetting you and so I think they're upset at me for basically pointing out what a you know how will all toddlers crawling towards a gun on Twitter the you know it's not all people I mean what you're so you're pointing out some of the issues that many other people have seen yeah this is not well yeah I don't think what you're saying is controversial at all you're just astute I don't think said that story I've heard about Justine Sacco a few years ago and about how you know the woman who tweeted go into Africa hope I don't get AIDS just kidding I'm white and then when she'll lol yeah and then when she was asleep on the plane you know thinking she'd made a smart cut her South Park II and joke mocking her and privilege like everyone United to dis and she was fired yeah I had by the time she landed yeah and you know everyone from that misogynistic controls through to social justice people all United you know to destroy this Orban you know she upset everyone and yeah so that I think that story became pretty powerful at the Sam and I think it probably affected Twitter's business where people got too scared to go into it I think that's oh I don't think it dropped their biz so if at all I think it do I think I think people started to think like it may have recovered now but I think people started to think fuck if Twitter's not fun you know just from the justine sacco one racist joke that she got fired for you think that really have an overall effect on twitter use i think well what happened was i my book got extracted in the new york times it was that story and that story kind of went crazy viral it really spoke to kind of spoke to people's like that like deep fears that story well deep fears they might get drunk and Papas antics and say something really stupid do the same saying wake up in Africa fired yeah exactly and and I think that that kind of probably affected I don't think it did I think they need to relax I think all that stuff just makes people interested and then makes more people sign up and I just I don't boy I don't see that at all if they were upset at you over that that's pretty preposterous I wondered I've given I gave talks a Facebook and Google you're upset they won't give you a talk well I'm going on but I'm curious I'm curious I mean is it for their Orwellian Council and maybe they'll go over every word you're about to say oh wow what is their trust and verify counsel what the fuck is that called yeah they have all they have some people on that or that are ridiculous social justice warriors proven attention whores people that are dishonest there's not they're not honest people and they're a part of this whole thing where their business is getting attention and being a victim yeah and and exploiting it to the nth degree I mean that's that's a bunch of people that are on that thing that's what they do I do think like if you're gonna address harassment on social media you have to accept that it comes from both sides yes on the right to the left it comes to the left to the right it comes to misogynists to feminists that comes from feminists you also could define what is harassment and what is criticism now if you have ideas in the open marketplace of ideas and you have ideas that people think are profoundly ridiculous they're allowed to mock your ideas that is not harassment I just think that that is someone shitting on you yeah and you put yourself out there I mean especially someone who's look you know these people a lot of them they're not singers they're not authors they're not musicians they're not comics they're not they're not producing anything other than their words right so if someone doesn't like your words and they shit on your words like that what else do you expect yeah I noticed that there was some kind of gas lighting going on on the left like like everyone would agree the sort of world that I come from like the Guardian and you know the left like everyone would agree that if a gang of misogynists sort of gang up on a particular feminist writer and basically harasser until she goes offline everyone agrees that's that's bad and it is bad it is well yeah but when the mirror image of that is happening right people pretend it doesn't people just pretend it's not happening right when someone goes after someone on the right even if it's a woman like you know a perfect example of that was no feminist stood up to defend Sarah Palin like there's no one I mean you never heard that when Bill Maher was calling her a cunt and all these different people were mocking her in that no one's stepping up and saying hey that's a woman that's a mother you know that someone's someone's mom like leave her alone have some respect for women if you're a woman and you're conservative like you might as well be a monster man that was there was undoubtedly the sort of was cognitive dissonance like when somebody's being harassed they don't want it and see themselves as doing the same thing to to a group of people that they don't like well it's very easy to think of someone who is opposed to your point of view or thinks of things completely different as another yeah you don't even think of them as a person I know this happened to me you know I an editor said that they wanted to run a series of articles about about bullying on the internet and wanted me to like you know contribute to the series and they said they wanted it to all be about how women are being bullied by men and I said you know I've no doubt that that happens a lot and it's presumably disproportionate like women are bullied by men more than other groups are bullied you know that could well be true but if the series of a school is only about women being bullied by Merlin you know legitimize a certain types of bullying like when the left pile in on somebody like justine sacco it's gonna legitimize you know what it does that partial it's going to legitimize certain types of bullying and the editor when i said that too kind of rolled her eyes as if to say well you would think that wow yeah both you know it's true it's true and and you know the problems not gonna go away until we yeah they're hypocrites I mean that's essentially what's going on it's just people don't want to be nice they think that there's power and shaming and they think I mean I've had multiple conversations with people online that think there is good in shaming people I'm like what you saying that because you're hiding behind a keyboard and it's a free shot but if you had to sit down with that person in front of them and talk to them face-to-face and and feel the social consequences right it reminds me remember I was telling you about what are the consequences that I look at in the butterfly effect about the tech takeover of porn is that if you're a 25 year old adult actress you can't get work now because you're in this sort of hinterland between teen and milf and I think that that's not just porn that's the internet like on social media you know if you're if you're a kind of loud aggressively authoritarian person on the left or a loud aggressively authoritarian person on the right you like the teen or the MILF like those of us in the mid are these people who are more interested in people talking to each other and and they don't you know we don't want to like scream we want to listen understand we like the 25 year old adult film app yeah that'd work well people don't like nuanced points of view and they also don't like people that are willing to talk to anybody you know I've had so many people call me some sort of a right-wing monster and I'm like well let's go over what makes a right-wing month what is right-wing I support gay marriage I support universal healthcare I'm absolutely in favor if it could work I don't know if it would work of universal basic income like where does it where do I become right-wing like where does it go antiwar like where do I become right-wing I don't think I can in politics as in porn everything now has to be kind of keyword searchable so everybody has to fall into some sort of nation and if you're not doing it yourself then someone else is gonna do it for you yeah but even when you're saying that like you don't that's not real like you don't have to you don't have to fall into those categories it's just be easier for people to categorize you if you did fall into those categories I'm sure I have some points of view that people would consider conservative and I have many more points of view that most people would consider to be liberal but it's very convenient especially when you look like me and I look like a meathead as easy to say that I'm some meathead conservative or a right winger or something along those lines but I'm Way more likely to vote for someone on the left than I am for someone on the right because I think the people on the right janne in general are more suppressive especially socially and culturally and I think that's where the real issues like when you look at like the Obama did yeah on the right when you look at what Obama did in office in terms of like what he did for its drones about freedom of the press and going on after whistleblowers and I got a lot of that was very right very right-wing if you looked at in terms of like in actual real consequences of him being the president a lot of it was very right-wing but when you look at in terms of like support for gay marriage and you know in passing the Affordable Care Act and all that stuff was a very left-wing I don't know if the Affordable Care Act was good because a lot of small businesses that small doctors with small offices hated it and think thought it was absolutely horrible and killed their business I don't know who's right about that because I don't obviously I don't have to deal with that it's a controversial subject but the idea behind it I liked I liked the idea that we would have some sort of universal healthcare because I think the idea of someone being too poor to get health care in this incredible country like if we're gonna pay if our taxes are gonna go to anything god damn doesn't it shouldn't go to caring for our neighbors and our fellow humans like that seems to me to be a no-brainer yeah and that's probably a pretty left-wing idea well I got a but but it's easy to call me a right-winger for whatever reason I find that fascinating that people do not like a nuanced approach that they it's not that they don't like it is that they find it extremely easy to categorize you and some sort of a negative caricature hmm yeah I got a question I'm can I just like totally change the subject for a second we have Alex Jones in common because I'm AI years ago snuck into Bohemian Grove with Alec no and what year did that was that that was like the one he did it in like the late 90s 9019 you were with him on that that's right yeah but I I since I saw you last I rekindled my relationship with Alex as a means of trying to get inside the Trump world didn't go gray it didn't go well whatever that well what I think I annoyed Alex although would you do I basically said the election of political sway you told him no well I wrote it in in a story about him I know I went to the RNC and I sort of you know got back in with Alex and spend a little bit time hanging around with him and Roger stone and so on and got really interested in the kind of dynamics of how Aleksandra communicate to each other but I'm wondering you've seen Alex more recently than I have well actually been my friend since 1998 yeah I was at his custody trial not long ago and you were both up he was welcome part on my show I'm just testing it I see George Soros makes the weed stronger that's what he said he said that disgusted each other that's exactly he said he said he tests it once a year just to cuz he's he's weird because he's happens I mean I come on man what's really funny is we drank whisky on the show - no one gives a shit about that that's way more destructive it's the pot whatever it is self-reflective yeah you know he paranoia inducing marijuana yeah it's a real problem but I I now wonder so he says that Trump called him just after the election game and thanked him and I'm inclined to believe that's true because I don't think that's the kind of thing that Alex would lie about but have you got any have you come to any conclusion about whether there is a connection between Alex and Trump no because I'm beginning to think maybe there just isn't any more but I could be wrong that's a good question I don't know I mean first of all I don't see how Trump can have a connection with that many people I feel like the job of being the president has got to be so insanely demanding the idea that he like he's taken a few moments out of his day he's got his feet up on the chair with a laptop and he's on infowars.com is like I got a call Alex and find out what the fuck's going on with this child slavery thing on Mars Alex where these slaves tell me where we're on Mars I think it benefits everyone to think that Alex because it makes it makes trouble up there yeah so it benefits people on the left is me now alex is is connected to trump yeah it kind of benefits Alex I think for people to think it too because they're grand eyes well it helps him in a way I mean it's like the people that yeah there's a bunch of people that enjoy Alex right so some of them enjoy it for the theater there's a theater element of it all you know I mean it's all doom and gloom and and then some of it some people enjoy because like Bohemian Grove occasionally he's correct like Bohemian Grove is a real mindfuck you see all these super rich people were in robes whatever in effigy yeah I was in the crowd yeah with all the old men of wealth little Dallas that freaked you out as soon as people one thing freaked me out like Alex came out of Bohemian Grove night with a with with a varying interpretation of what was your interpretation my interpretation is basically with one caveat I'm about to caveat this okay my interpretation was that it's just like fucking skull and bones oh yeah you know those were all creepy right yeah and they want to do it that does seem to be amongst the American ruling elites that does seem to be a proclivity for ritual yeah maybe maybe amongst the British elites as well I'm not sure but but that's in itself psychologically interestingly I think secrets too but so it's like why so that is interesting that why even if the ritual at Bohemian Grove I you know and I would contend that contrary to what Alex implied they weren't actually sacrificing a child no you didn't say they were sacrificing a church oh and say at some point in this video yeah he probably was so jazzed up that they were actually dressed up like monks he with the hoods and they have the Molech the owl guy when he was actually there I mean that probably ramped up his love of conspiracy three or four hundred percent it was hilarious because you know we went in separate later because Alex got it into his head that maybe I was part of the Bohemian Grove oh you like deep deep inside yeah like the way that I was like luring him in some he was so he went in separately to me he won't buy the undergrowth mmm and I went up this driveway gave the security guard a kind of I rule the world wave and then we went in there that's why you wanna do yeah yeah I miss Mary guards yeah the guy so often the case yeah so white house and then we saw Alex and my kunsan who was this producer that I'm walking like towards ice now is with this local lawyer who would who would we talked up with and I was like hey you know Alex Mike are you doing and they were like keep walking there's cameras in the trees there's hours everywhere and then his house yes because oh we felt like the owls were cameras they got it into their heads that the owls at Bohemian Grove the owl motifs that Bohemian Grove with indicative of the fact that it was like Moloch the how old God yeah and it was like some sort of satanic but actually I would say that the reason why there's all those owls because I saw like stuffed owls in display cabinets and so on but I think it's like I think it's an owl sanctuary but anyway but i they stuff them there well I also I mean I presume it died of natural causes mr. shitty fucking sanctuary if they kill it then stuff it so it's sort of like Norman Bates mom and if I go but what was odd that night was one thing that the oddest moment and this is where I will this is where my memory of the night does tally with Alex's is that for whatever reason the people in the crowd were really into this this ceremony landline there was a sort of they were really fired up by it let's remember this old guy walked up to me before it started and so your first timer and I won't yeah I know you gotta love it or something along those loans and and it did make me think like and then I look behind and there was Alex and Mike wide-eyed looking like they were bring you know the belly at the based and then there's all these old preppy men like wide-eyed they were really into it too I felt like the only sane person in the entire redwood forest I was like the only person was thickness it's fucking ridiculous it is ridiculous but but they were into it it was that moment it was that moment of Revelation actually that then led me to write the book that I wrote after that book which was the many stare at goats which was about you know soldiers try to kill goats just by staring because I don't know because I remember like I remember thinking I was actually I was in Belfast I was getting to talk about my book them which is where I talk about all of that stuff and simply said okay so I know what you think of it this woman in the audience said I know what you think I know you think this is like ridiculous and I know that Alex Jones thinks it's evil but what about the people in the crowd what were they thinking about it and I thought that's a really good question so that's what led me to write a book about like a rational thought in powerful places which is what let me talk monster goes now when you when you're there and you see that there really is this giant stone owl and they really do have this bundle of sticks that they're burning and everyone really is wearing these robes that like I mean you had a part of you how to be like how many of these fucking things are going on that we haven't infiltrated well yeah that's true that there's there's a photo of it there this is real yeah I mean they really do have a giant owl and they really do burn some sort of a sacrifice in front of this owl yeah and there's a speaker's there that's at this at one point this is a lesser documented part of the ritual at one point there's a guy in leaf covered later hose and appears in like a stage cut out of the redwood tree and start singing this kind of elegy to nature like old trees Oh leaves so that's how it starts that's before of the men in robes Turner so it's like some weird pagan nature yeah literal covered later Alison Joe how much would you give to be in wall of skull and bones meetings see if they actually like film each other sucking dicks or something there's just something that goes on where they have like something over those guys supposedly that's like though yeah the conspiracy theories that's they make their engage in gay sex I do believe these things happen for a reason like you know skullenbones exist for a reason because they have something over you it could be that or it could be just this weird sense weird sort of psychological need that people like Ivy League people feel they need to like have a sense of superiority and one way to do that is to kind of create these secret rituals to give them a sense of like you know grandeur over the people that's possible now a guy like Alex Jones stumbles upon something like that or infiltrates it and finds out it is real I mean that is justifying to such a an enormous enormous level yeah but Alex but here's my my truck with Alex and all of this is that it wasn't like for Alex all the fucking crazy shit that we saw that night wasn't enough lucky hot to like turn it up to 11 of course yeah and imply that we had possibly witnessed an actual human sacrifice of course but that's standard that's standard Alex Jones 101 but it shouldn't be style it shouldn't be but I mean I mean think about all the exaggerations exaggerations that take place in the media whether it's on the left or the right there's just rampant exaggerations well it's funny you should say that so did you watch Alex being interviewed by megyn kelly yesterday yeah well that may be laughs you know they phoned me a couple of days before the broadcast Megyn Kelly's people oh because they were panicking too remember there was like a lot of criticism they were going for having him on in the first place yeah so they called me up and they basically wanted me to give them as much evidence as I could that proved that Alex and Trump were you know aligned and home to each other and so on called you why because you went to Bohemian Grove with them I want to be meek okay then I also put out this little Kindle single last summer called the elephant in the room in which I'm trying to trace like the relationship between Alex and Trump their virus and its career in this interesting stuff but so I answered the questions as best as I could but I don't know that much about exactly how often Trump and Alex talk to each other yeah I'm not really that interested in it as well as odd as it is like I have a very fucked up relationship with Alex in in that he's actually my friend and so when I see him it's like what's up man what'd he do and I give him a hug and people go huh he's a monster or how could be friends with them and this and that like I don't know yeah I just base it on my interactions with him and yet does he say fucked up things yeah the most disturbing thing that I didn't even know when he did the podcast I didn't know that he was a Sandy Hook denier right so apparently he's backed off that since being confronted by the facts and and there was a horrible article that I read about a father who was actually a conspiracy theorist until his son was killed in Sandy Hook and then he got death threats for lying and presumably from in filleth yeah and that was so - so just so sad yeah that's just so our people look for fucking conspiracies in everything and I don't know what it is I have friends that have this issue I don't understand it things that can be easily explained they look for a conspiracy anything that happens in the news there's got to be a different story like sometimes shit just happens and when that shit happens the news has a story it doesn't always have to be some sort of nefarious plot these people also think that the government is filled with idiots well I'm sorry but you can't have it both ways you can't have a bunch of incompetent fuck heads who pull off the perfect fake world where everything you see is some sort of an elaborate played out scheme in order to manipulate you and either buying this or voting for that like there's a weird inclination that people have to not just not just some conspiracy theorists but almost everything to think everything is some part of some crazy plot yeah sure I understand it what you said about lie get a biases and untruths and like across the major on the left arm and right remote to me if they're making Kelly think so you know so they phoned me up obviously in a bit of a panic because they were getting like so much criticism right and then they reacted the show like frantically just before it went really yeah part of their change well I don't know but what I do know is like you I saw the final product and the final product was basically megyn kelly like looking incredibly poised saying you know you're wrong Alex you're wrong about this and then it would cut to how that's going but but then we cut to Megan so all they did was lie edit Alex at his most sweaty and stuttery hmm and then megyn kelly at her most poised and perfect so did you see you hear the Alex Jones audio the leaked audio that he released yes where they were sort of buttering him up and conning him yeah she was saying yeah personally I'm saying I'm not here to make a hit piece I just want to know the real you and honest although they did read it so I I wonder what the original program would have been like because they felt forced to base it by him yeah well they felt forced by like the people pushing back against them doing it yeah to then put out this shitty you know ten minutes I wish to say yeah it was in Megyn Kelly's corner I would have told her first of all don't ever go to NBC listen here's the deal like you made your bones as an ice princess on this conservative Network and do you think they're just gonna accept you at NBC people are gonna resent you they're gonna hate you well you're the lady that chastised people for saying that Sam cause potentially wasn't white remember that I don't oh my god it was some thing where they were saying there was people talking about Santa Claus being black and I'll never forget it she was on TV going you know listen Santa Claus is white like I'm like put this fuck the fuck are you talking about Santa Claus isn't really crazy bitch white more than you can see Cat in the Hat is red they're not real things you know you can decide that you know like the Cat in the Hat in the book is always white okay yeah you're right good point but but is he black is white what does the cat have he's got a hat is red and white what color is he though hmm I think he's black right is he okay it's not important but what's important is that like her whole thing was being a spokesperson is ultra hot spokesperson for the conservative movement but also being someone who's ruthlessly smart and articulate and capable of shutting down these stammering liberals then dare go and question her her narrative man all since she's on NBC look you can't do that that's a terrible move they're not gonna accept you this is not gonna work and the ratings have been horrendous and now she's fit now they pulled the show they pulled the show early but it just goes to show light you know we rightly attack people like info was for spreading you know outright lies yes but we on the left like megan kelly editing that segment to make it look like she was poised and perfect and all alex does is stammer and sweat what's very hard very hard sell saying the Megyn Kelly's on the Left which is on the left now what I mean like the mainstream and Greta main sees at NBC so the mainstream right has its own tricks it's like it's not an outright lie like Alex would do mm-hmm but that you know panicky selective editing it's a way of its own well I would I would have imagined that like during the interview between Alex and megyn kelly alex would have said some things that were you know eloquent or or or substance without a stammer in a sweat i'm sure yeah well here's a also problem and having any sort of a conversation about any sort of difficult subject and stuffing it into seven minutes or whatever it is is ridiculous yeah it's an ancient way of communicating and now that we have the Internet and Alex is shown with his own show you know that he can go and rant about something and you know for 15 minutes or whatever it is like and with no limitations or restrictions like that it's it's a better way to communicate and one of the things that I wanted to do when I had Alex on the podcast is I wanted people to see the Alex that I know because there's no other way to see him like that I wanted to get him drunk I wanted to get him high and I wanted to have him talk and my friend Eddie who's just so into conspiracies he kind of fucked some of it because he's just so into chemtrails and proving that chemtrails are real right but it was good overall because it's like he was alex is so crazy that even eddie was like what yeah where Eddie turn to look at Alex's what's a fuck like what he's talking about interdimensional child molesters and it's I wanted people to see him the way I see him he's a fun guy that I like hanging out with do I think that he has a lot of influence yeah though I think he says things that he definitely shouldn't say of course especially the Sandy Hook stuff I mean I think this inclination to always look towards conspiracy yes is is it's dangerous it's horrible yeah yeah it's it's it's it's dangerous in that people are easily led and if you get people thinking that everything is a conspiracy the real problem is they don't know what the fuck a conspiracy actually is when it's in front of them and it's real right there's a ton of them that are real so when you caught your crying wolf around every corner and then all sudden you turn a corner like holy shit that's a real wolf no one is listening sure I agree that that's my frustration with Alex too is that he has a conspiracy template and whatever real-world event happens liam shoehorns yeah into this kind of simplistic template yeah yeah he's got some crazy ideas about Mars there's bait or no news was it with the moon there's bases on the moon that they're going to all the time is that what he's saying he's got some crazy moon thing like he thinks that they well they went on the moon the problem is what they found up there like he's got the goat spider hybrid that he talks about is true though he doesn't express it very well right but I learned this much right - Tarek goats all of those years ago that they really were like they really were mixing up spider silk with goat milk here we go waiting some kind of cows jones reveals the truth about animal-human hybrids and the moon landing the real problem give us some give her some volume here because alyc so mean it's like Kathy Griffin simulating murdering Trump the Trump says you ought to be ashamed of yourself and he's like how dare you you broke me you talk to me I'm a victim of poverty the left's run I agree with him 100% on that I felt like that was so preposterous and I like Kathy as a person I've met her a hundred times Kathy Griffin okay she's always sweet but when she was saying that he's a bully and he broke me and I was like oh my god you held up a photo of his headless body and his children could have seen her at his not his headless body his head separated from his body that his children could have seen like is that look what is that like that's that's it's so it's ineffective it didn't and then for her to say that like he broke her he's a bully like all he did was say it was horrible yeah like that he's targeting her it's like this this whole like professional victim thing that people enjoy they enjoy like taking on the role such they have such like energy they put to being the victim it's just God you you shouldn't hold up pictures of people's heads okay if you don't like them I mean especially like in this day and age when there's people that actually cut people's heads off and I mean show them on camera I mean this is fucking crazy yeah yeah you know by the way speaking of cutting people's heads off and showing them on camera around the time that I was hanging out with Alex a bohemian grove I was also hanging out documenting this Islamic in Coloma bokram muhammad who was the head of this group in Britain called Al Muhajiroun and a bunch of his people are the ones who like now drive vans into pedestrians Oh Anna makes me realize that all of their people with the curly craziest and most pernicious ideas that I hung out with in the 90s rose to the top and I'm influencing their worlds so including out well it's you know Alex I don't think I like just have political swag well maybe he's right about these animal human hybrids go back to that place we need to find out what's happening on the moon did you turn off of it go back to what you do vomiting violence fomenting death hmm all their mess reporters she broke me looks like the day of the dead on CNN just like Kathy Griffin I guess that's the look that suckers looking for and then they freak out and go you called me responsible you said that I was a bad person I've been crushed by you you're a bully it's a bunch of corporate special interest that had their foot or their knee on our neck and now they don't a hundred percent got us on the ground and they're just flipping out okay step above us how the fuck did he go from Kathy Griffin who's a comedian who did a gag that she thought was gonna get her attention to backfire to they're a bunch of corporate special interests who've had their knee on our neck like what so how the fuck is Kathy Griffin got her knee on anybody's neck like she's not corporation she's not special interest she's a fucking comic I know her you can can that conspiracy instantaneously you looking for the part we talked about the moon look if I had to see what this human animal I but here's the thing I agree with you that he has too much influence over some people but I disagree in that I don't think I don't think any of that should be taken seriously like what what he just said should not be something seriously right I mean none of this would matter if there wasn't just the possibility that Trump believes their stuff although I'll tell you what I would say last summer I was when I was about this book the elephant in the room try to trace that just how it worked Alex by Roger stone meeting Trump and so on I discovered one really interesting thing which is this is something that Alex didn't like Alex did say to me when I was writing this book you could write whatever you want I don't care by that turned out to not be entirely true there were things that he did care about that I wrote and one of them was I talked to Glenn Beck and he told me this before Trump was elected he told me this story about how Trump invited him tomorrow logo around the time that Trump was deciding to stand and he phoned Glenn Beck even though they were both at mar-a-lago Trump was in run one room and Glenn Beck was in the other and Trump from Glenn Beck and said III think you have liked them you know you're so influential you're so great you know you're great you've got such influence you can you can unite the Tea Party and the mainstream Republicans and Glenn Beck thought you know fuck you I don't know what you're doing here you know yeah you're playing me I've been down this road a million times and then Trump did the same thing to Alex he phoned Alex and said you know you have so much influence you're so amazing and Alex bought it mmm according to Glenn Beck no no I spoke to both of them I mean when you have didn't spoke to Trump I didn't speak to jump so it's both Glenn Beck and Alex right I don't know that Glenn Beck really did get that phone call from Trump right well it won't come back told me that right so either Glenn Beck what you think right Glenn Beck has said some pretty ridiculous shit himself it's joining I came a Mormon at the age of like 50 so but I do think that's convenient like if it's right is convenient makes it makes it look interesting although well I mean it's what Glenn Beck told me only I think word for that story I mean you don't really know right well I mean I bet told me that I believe that if Donald Trump called up Alex and said you're so influential and you're amazing and Al's goes well Thank You mr. president were gonna do our best to keep you in office and fight against the tyranny and all these fucking people out there the thing they're gonna stop he's he's mean that's who he is yes you know you can get him riled up that's who he is what I do I do think that Alex has the kind of bit of an ear fighting in all of this because nobody had taken him that seriously before not nobody in positions of power had taken him that seriously yeah but here's a deal I think Trump played Alex and Alex was played you might be right but if if Trump turned on Alex and said you know Infowars is bunch of losers as much of this now Alex would he would turn it around again and they would go after Trump yeah like he would Oh Alex was really smart like Alex but from the beginning said like I'm with Trump until Trump does something you know but I don't like it and I'll drop him like a hot potato so Alex was very smart like Alex always gave him like gave himself a sort of parachute on his relationship so so I think Trump played Alex and Alex was a bit too gullible and believed Trump's slick talk no but Alex was also smart and gave himself an out whenever he wanted the outs alex is goddamned entertaining like that alone is fucking entertaining especially for me a person I'm not gonna be influenced by these things that he says but one thing that I have been influenced is by him uncovering some things that are real conspiracies one of them being agent provocateurs that they used to disrupt peaceful protests this was something that I didn't know was a was a standard tactic by the military and by certain politicians and what they do is they will hire these people I don't know like what branch of the military what they do but they will hire these people and it's been confirmed by people that I know that are like special operators they take these masked guys and say if they have some peaceful protest the big one was the World Trade Organization remember that protest yeah and these guys with masks and government-issue boots came in started smashing windows lighting things on fire and that gave them an excuse to come in and break up this riot where it had been a peaceful protest where they couldn't stop the peaceful protest so now they break up these riots that they've created themselves sort of resting people left and right then they put up a no protest zone this is all documented let see this is I mean he documented he documented this and has been documented by many people since then and and even in legitimate circles like it was a big factor in the Occupy Wall Street movement the Occupy Wall Street movement was infiltrated ad nauseam by people from whatever branch of government whoever the fuck they were but yeah what they did was they they caused chaos and then it give them an excuse to arrest him and then in the World Trade Organization thing Alex detailed like with news reports independent news reports how those people were not arrested and they were all negotiate ago she ated their freedom they all held up you know how somewhere and then they got them out of there as soon as everybody kind of like forgot about it all and then they set up a no protest zone and the no protest zone was fascinating because there's a lot of people that disagreed with the policies of the World Trade Organization and these people were going to work with a pin on a backpack or a jacket that said WTO and had a line through it the police told them they could not go through with the pin on they could not go to work with a pin on that had a line through the word WTO like they opposed the WTO this is a no protest zone Wow that's Alex Jones showed that so as wacky as he might be about alien babies that are coming from another dimension that here to steal your soul and make you vote libertarian like he he might be wrong about a lot of shit but he also he's got the balls to expose a lot of crazy shit that people didn't talk about yeah mine's me overtime I went to Aryan Nations just before it closed down remember Aryan Nations what is it Idaho oh they had that there was like near Boise right yeah champ Oh Coeur d'Alene that's a relay which is gorgeous is crazy yeah that's that crazy Lake up there they have yes beautiful so I was making a documentary about Randy Weaver about Ruby Ridge and I was spending a lot of time with Randy's daughter Rachel who I liked a lot anyway like part of the reason why the whole Ruby Ridge escalation happened was because Randy we've had gone to people a lot of people don't know that story but I tell the story yeah okay so it was a family of white separatists Randy and Vicky and their children Sarah and Rachel and a boy whose name I forgot some people to be it'll come to me anyway so um they moved to Idaho early concealing conspiracy theorists they moved to Idaho to her to a cabin on top of a hill at playschool Ruby Creek anyway Randy and Vicky used to go to Aryan Nations fill out their picnics and barbecues but they weren't and this is a kind of pivotal point they weren't as crazy as the people at Aryan Nations they weren't white supremacists but they were sort of fellow travelers but not quite as crazy so Aryan Nations was infiltrated like all white you know supremacist groups by lots of federal agents and they saw Randy and thought they could work with him so they said to her and a you know will it be an informant for us and Randy said no so then they sent in this guy and asked Randy to sawed-off shotgun a quarter of an inch below the legal limit so Randy sawed off the shotgun for this guy and then they said we're federal agents you just committed a felony you're gonna go to prison unless she become an informant for us against Aryan Nations and Randy being a kind of hot-headed idiot said no fuck off I made a big show of saying no fuck off so they went back to their cabins they went back to the cabin and a warrant was issued for Randy's arrest and rented and turn up to court so now the u.s. marshals are like hiding in the bushes looking at Randy's cabin Randy arms his kids in his tiny little kids you know so they're patrolling up and down outside the cabin with these guns they were becoming increasingly paranoid thinking they were being watched from the bushes and they were being watched from the bushes CCTV cameras and US Marshals anyway one day the u.s. marshals got too close to the cabin and one of Randy's dogs started barking and the kid Randy Sun came out twelve-year-old kid look much younger look like eight years old came out with a gun and gun fire happened the u.s. marshals shot the little boy nearly shot his arm off and he turned around and tried to run back to the cabin shouting bad and the u.s. marshals shot him in the back and killed him and they killed the dog and one u.s. marshal was killed and there's debate as to whether it was either the Randy's son or a family friend or whether it was friendly fire or not so they got the son's body and put him in the in the cabin and the next day this FBI shot shooter called along Horiguchi turned up said the FBI surrounded the cabins US Marshal had been killed there were tanks there were hundreds of troops this was like in the Clinton nineties when the Cold War was kind of dying and they needed a new enemy and so the new enemy that week was Randy Weaver in his family so Vickie Weaver was holding their baby Elizabeth in the doorway of the cabin and the sharp shooter shot Vickie through the face builder and then they pulled Vicki's body into the cabin and Anna brandy was shot as well but survived and a siege and she would have like lasted about two weeks of the kids inside the cafe and the FBI outside of the cabin it ended up ending peacefully Bogue writes it was a bit kind of militia hero turned up and sort of helped to stop it from happening to you know helped you know to get Randy out of the cabin and in the end the daughters each got a million dollars each and compensation and and it all kind of faded away so I was making a documentary about all of this and I went to Aryan Nations because I thought I can just turn up and say I'm friends with Mandy Weaver and they'd let me and so I turned up and immediately all of these Skynyrd's surrounded me and started asking me what my genealogy was because they thought correctly then you're a Jew I'm Joe so I said what's my genealogy this that was the word they use what's your genealogy so I said I said I'm Church of England and one of the Nazis their Aryan Nations made a joke and said something like old Church of England you're the guys who Glover made some kind of joke and the Skynyrd sort of drifted away from me and I'm I've always thought that the guy who alleviated the situation was maybe an undercover agent who was like calming things down don't you think so protecting me it's always crossed mine knowing how infiltrated those groups always are just like the video they saw knowing how infiltrated those groups are do they know how I own filtrated there they must oh right that's gotta be so weird oh I know they must do because they would like infiltrated to fuck I mean all of them were yeah well that's one thing the federal government does good they infiltrate the mob the door was getting people to wear wires right but good at that yeah Jamie wearing a wire I forget we're live that Junaid yeah so I think I think they protected me in that moment when I could have had the shit kicked out of me you think so yeah I thought you were Jewish yeah well cuz I am and I'm obviously fuckin Jewish no not necessarily do you think yeah people don't know anything and they think all English people look like you it was my own stupid fault I drove up the drive past all the signs that said no Jews mmm Jews turn back now as as they surrounded me I did think to myself like if I get beaten up now it's my own stupid fault did you think is so weird because it's a race and it's also religion it's a weird one yeah no that's weird right yeah because you're European but you're also Jewish but which is a religion yeah so if you're a European atheist are you still a Jew yeah well I mean I am basically I remember when I wasn't doing us with all my battery the Islamic fundamentalist and he he outed me as a Jew at his jihad training camp yes in a place called Crowley which is near Gatwick Airport how rude he said to me look at me with the infidel John who is a Jew and they all would ha I said I said surely it's better to be a Jew than an atheist and I heard someone in the crowd go no isn't the thing that really surprises me about that exchange is that I am an atheist so of all the places where I would choose for the first time in my life to cut of exert my Jewishness like a pyro I chose a fucking Jihad trade you can't like what what self defeat you have second thoughts about that one like were you in the midst of those people going what the fuck am I playing with here yes although quite quickly this the tension dissipated and I remember like a bunch of these young radical Islamists all started asking me like what what it was like to be a Jew they were like treating me like a kind of tropical fish shit like what a baby's taste like and I remember leaving that jihad training camp that day thinking I'd done some sterling work in bringing together communities like and well I thought I believed it till like you know 9/11 oh wow don't believe it anymore I know most people were like people in that room at that Scout hurt went on to become suicide bombers and to kill people and to drive fans into people it was a different world before 9/11 though yeah the the fear of jihadis was much much much less prevalent yeah I made this funny I made this film curtain amount Oliver spent a year with Omar Bakri and it was a kind of comic film about his attempts to like you know he said he wouldn't rest until he saw the flag of Islam flying over Downing Street so we made this sort of almost comic film about his sort of blundering attempts to create like Sharia law and Britain and and the joke of the film is that ice is never going to work and it was kind of you know some of these ideas were ridiculous like at one point you have these five thousand but balloons carrying the call to war on his little like they were like leaflets like attached to these balloons would like to slogans like Islam is the future of Britain and they were gonna like fly over London and land wherever but they hadn't properly calculated like the the weight ratio so these fucking balloons they like let them off and they all just like stayed on the floor so all year they were like failing at doing everything but yeah but then lie this is like 96 and then five years later 9/11 happened and now Omar's in prison in Beirut for inciting terrorism and a lot of Omar's people became terrorists true Jon Ronson you've been around I've been here since I have seen sure so when was the last time you were in Alex's presence just texting account no have you been around him yeah oh yeah yeah I was I went to visit Infowars last summer last August and what did you think of him like knowing him in the late 90s when you guys went to Bohemian Grove together and knowing him now well I mean his operation has expanded like massively oh yeah yeah when I knew Alex in the 90s Infowars was a spare bedroom in his house with choo-choo train wallpaper yellow trains at an impasse Strikes Back poster it was Alex Mike Hanson Alex's girlfriend they always caught a violet that her real name's Kelly mmm I said to her cuz I went to the custody hearing for a couple of days oh so I saw him then I went to the custody hearings I was just curious right and I said to a lot the last time I saw the two of you you were like kissing and telling each other how much he loved each other and then like 16 years passes and it's the worst like divorce that Texas has ever known that's what divorce lawyers were saying like it was it the worst oh they just cause of one national and they just hate each other so much they hate each other I said like yeah and now alex has got a staff of like 75 people you know with like these giant tigers for his supplements his male vitality supplements have you ever seen the video of when Joey Diaz and me are in Alex's studio and Joey realizes that it's on the internet so because it's on the internet he could say whatever he wants so we go we go live and Alex goes well actually from here on out we're on the internet so you can kind of say whatever you want but try to keep it clean and the look of for Joey Diaz it was like the cat who saw the canary and realized that the cage was open and he had so he's telling some story about smuggling weed through the airport listen to this bullshit congressman or your bullshit governor or even a bullshit presence of the political resident and he's taking that same bullshit give you every four fucking years and you still vote for the fucking Momo and then you get mad think about me saying the word fuck with that I'm on solid points I know you get it the American public know that every four years they buy the same shit they've been buying it for years and the same people with 10,000 Harvard articulation and the holiday don't curse and they're Christians and they have a family and these are the same people that shove up your fucking ass every year if I need some hey he made Alex speech he's funny Sarah lived do you think Alex regrets all of this no he's great I have a good time with our own you know when I say all of this I mean to think Alex regrets the fact that though you know that the spotlight is on him in there kind of stressed out what honestly I've never met a guy in my life that has more Teflon when it comes to stress like welcoming Kahn stressed out lately but I go to the gym I feel fine had a cheeseburger probably shouldn't have that shit trying to stick to my diet that's hard he hasn't give a fuck man like you he's a weird guy like he's got a very unusual Constitution you know what I bet did stress them out though there was a couple of like pending lawsuits like Chobani and Barney wasn't mean to bother the yogurt people yeah he got into trouble with Chobani because he said they were like importing rapists and of course he got into trouble with the pizza restaurant and I would bet me pizza gate that shit you Infowars alex jones apologize for saying Shabani supports migrant rapists didn't really say oh jesus oh fuck i would guarantee that I'll guarantee you that that and the pizza gate stuff properly stressed him out because I think both of those would were risking entire operation okay let me tell you something it might stress you out like if it was you and you were being sued by Shabani you'd probably freaking out and you're like I've clearly made a horrible mistake I need to come clean I need to apologize I'm so paranoid that I freak out if I eat a Chobani guava and think I'm like fuck this is most disgusting thing of every and I mind my threshold for getting like panicky and stressed out it's very love that's incredible considering you're in a jihadi camp yeah I know IIIi often wonder why I put myself why I changes maybe that's why it's so compelling when you do yeah but Alex you think doesn't new right no I know him man he's he's a different dude but you know like he's got a like there's a I I don't agree with a lot of the stuff he says just like I don't agree with a lot of stuff my friend Eddie says but I love the both of them it's a it's weird man and I get it I get people saying that he's got too much influence and he does you know but my take is like if you really think there's fuckin alien bases on the moon and that there's child slaves on Mars fuckin shame on you shame on you you know I think the deeper and the more crazy he goes the better his show is more entertaining I I mean I mean I'm about a bad person for that I don't think I am though yeah you got me wondering like why I put myself in dangerous situations really I should be thinking about it a little bit maybe it's because people have anxiety disorders are quite good when it comes to actual like difficult situations because we've rehearsed it so many times like we planning unnecessarily so often that when something really worth panicking comes along we actually handled it really well well let me ask you is there ever been a situation where you were confronted with an idea and you're like you know what that one is too dangerous I'm not doing that yeah when I was writing the men who stare at goats the monastery goats was about this kind of secret unit in the 80s of like soldiers who were trying to like walk through walls and Brazzaville and kills that remote-viewing as well yeah remote feeling was that there was it they would they were different but there was like an overlap I met a bunch of those guys who's doing that sci-fi show right chill mcmoneagle and that day mr. James I met with him okay he was talking to me about how they found you know various bad people using this weird stuff and I was like yeah oh yeah no so I met all of those people to like remote viewing sounds like really exciting but you know psychic spies in the military but it turns out that actually their lives were quite shit because basically the fucking room all day tried to like psychically sketched like 20 years in my nose one of them told me that because they were black up because they didn't officially exist you have no coffee machine that's a light thing that I'm coffee and to work every day because they couldn't like just family also that the the room that they're in was really like bad because they couldn't get it repaired because they didn't exist right yeah so their lives are quite shit so I tell how I color came to this story so that was out this guy called Jim Schnabel had written his book called remote viewers which kind of you know uncovered all of that stuff and there was this magician called ray hyman who was like a skeptic I think he's dead now the CIA brought him in to assess the remote viewing program to see whether they should keep it going or close it down and Ray Hyman said it was kind of nonsense and so that helped them the CIA closed down the unit so I met ray hyman and I just happened to say to him it's like one of those questions that kind of changes your life I said to him lie so when you were like in the military like sniffing around with the remote viewers did you happen to notice like anything else going on anyone he went yeah he said there was this general called Stubblebine who like thought he could like burst clouds with his mind and there's this little kernel called Chanin who thought that he could lie you know train soldiers like fast for a month and so I had these like two names double burn and Shannon and the whole minister goat stuff which which wasn't out in the open all came out it was amazing that they were trying to kill goats just by staring at them did so yeah yeah so they had like I met this guy who was that part of the goat staring program like this is all at Fort Bragg I had a trip run Fort Bragg one time and I said to them like somewheres Gottlob don't suppose know about that lab yeah so they had like at one point they had like 30 goats in a room and they were all staring at girl number 16 they all had numbers on their backs and goat number 17 fell over collateral damage I mean I would I would argue that if he stared at goat long enough it's gonna fall over and everything's gonna fall over eventually water when I was laughing okay sorry so the goat really did fall over and die well no oh well guys severely so we tracked down the goats terror this is two he now runs a dance studio in Ohio the savelii dance and martial arts studio yeah so we tracked him down I said I said to him on the phone so do you still ever like kill goats just by staring at them and he won't Willis have matter of fact just last week I I killed my hamster just by staring like three days old he said he said he said he caught it on video and I said what come to come and watch the video so we weren't he said okay so we flew to Ohio to meet guy savelii the whole time his son was filming me like the whole time I was there he was filming me so eventually like he admitted like why they were filming me and it was that he was worried that I might be al-qaeda like trying to learn how to stare at people and calm yes so he was that filming me just him so he really believed it totally so will this video did it show him staring in hamster and dog I saw the video of the hamster staring I should tell you by the way that the moment when they I think pinpoint at the moment when they worked out that I wasn't al-qaeda it was because it turns out that guys of Ellie's daughter is in the movie Chicago likes one of the dancers and so I kind of a kind of shrieks oh I love Catherine zeta-jones and I think let me all kind of Alaska I'll leave it like a kind of deep cover al-qaeda operatives wouldn't think to go that effeminate oh yeah so then they showed me the hamster video it's a hamster I'm sure this is on YouTube by the way I'm sure you can find us it's if you typed in I don't know Jon Ronson hamster crazy rulers of the world guys available so like he's like so perhaps it's like running around in its whale and that guy's off camera like staring at the hamster and then finally the hamster gets off the whale and it's like all the sawdust and then a hamster light drops light stops moving drops down and stops moving amid the sawdust so I'm like whoa and then the hamster gets up again and the video ends so I was like that's not dead like a guy's video the guy said yeah yeah my wife my wife told me like not to my wife said don't show them the part with a hamster dies what yeah in case I was like a bleeding heart liberal and I yeah his wife told him to not show you the video that you flew all the way the fuck to Ohio to see well I think it's possible that that hamster just doesn't die no way bro but guy showed me like a hope Elliott full screen please you need to fight it guys failure man hey what happens when you've got a guest he's on for three hours and they want to use the bath just do a bathroom good yeah yeah yeah we'll turn the volume here okay oh he's doing some fake martial arts - well this is hilarious oh you don't understand this is my favorite stuff Jon Ronson look at this this is my favorite stuff it's all like pokes oh it's called the triangle of death I don't know I'll go back to that I wouldn't need to I need to watch that again this is hilarious behind there's a carotid artery ooh the artery is the esophagus airway yeah helping a person you're hurting a person may need a clearer airway mmm they need to be able to breathe mm-hmm and they have circulation of blood through their body pause every second well it's one thing about bullshit artists is they always like using these real technical terms like especially martial arts bullshit artists they always talk about like like medical terms that they're like disrupting the the nerve the vagus nerve that goes to the brain and this is your c6 c7 your cervical disc and I'm gonna attack the cervical disc through the carotid artery they're all like it's almost like they learn all these technical terms it's sort of make their horseshit look more palatable please don't show anybody sir with your flabby grandma arms he's gonna watch he's gonna show you oh boy it's just the end part is my favorite where he does like the fucking garage stands behind the butt of the guy's back limp into the back guys wonderful I don't know why man I don't know why but this stuff gives me so much pleasure I and I enjoy fake martial arts videos more than almost anything more almost as much as hold this beer the Twitter every two days cuz I don't know why we see this development of the mind so you know you have a shit better than me right oh yeah absolutely do is this your bread and butter this is well this is something I've been doing more than ever doing anything in my whole life this is the first real exercise towards that goal he's the goat stuff in the mistake oh he's just gonna punch up watermelon oh you're crazy bro oh it's solid oh no way that impenetrable that's basically a brick wall he's gonna use his fingers one two oh I broke his hand son you broke your hand kid he's the first guy who took me round the didn't Mac the death touch he went right through that watermelon bro I would let that guy do that to me I'd be like okay fuck the watermelon dude we tighten them oh yeah this is yeah this is guy doing military stuff right this is this is D this is menace it's not really military but he's wearing a military hey I do know that guy like went to Fort Bragg and did the goat stuff like he showed me documentation but see this right here listen man I used to do this he picked his leg up what he's doing it this is hilarious this guys can do it his fingertips hey my true here's the thing when I was a kid like real young we used to do these demonstrations miles like 15 right when we would open up a new school we do these demonstrations and it was the only time we ever broke boards right we fucking never could it's really easy to do looks harder than hot coals right it's way easier than walking on hot coals right because those things the first of all the way they're cut is with the grid like the grain is it's going in a manner how it's the way we describe it so I give you're holding something up the grain is actually going in the way that you want it to break so you're breaking it with the grain you literally can do with your fingers like I could you could take and those are thin pieces of wood too you can take this piece of if this wood if this pad was a wood you just go like this with two fingers just go snap it would break right brings like nothing house 15 and we would do this karate kicks and punches and supplement they always broke I always broke so what is so easy to break so here's the question and what does it say about like Special Forces at Fort Bragg that they would bring guy in today well I mean it wasn't like I don't I don't believe it was like a like sanction from the very top but he certainly went to Fort Bragg and stared at goats he stared at goats at Fort Bragg well it probably just grabbed whatever dummies they could find like it get some dudes won't stare - goat like there's a lot of people though here's one thing that is a fact there's a lot of people particularly in the 80s and the 90s before the Ultimate Fighting Championship came around there was a lot of fake martial arts out there a lot I know people that we're teaching fake martial arts that got into the military they got into the police I knew it the guy who was deep in the police force and he had fake martial arts like his martial arts were fucking completely useless hmm and it tallies with the US military credo of like thinking out of the box like if we don't try this stuff nobody else will try this place here they're blurry easy it is as special forces other special special ops okay so yeah there you go I know killing goats Khan well I've never even heard that one Kelly's thing but you know then gently double-fried general stole about who I'm sure would have been a fan of this show cuz he was it he was a big fan of Alex's and so on so he was a head of Army Intelligence he had 16,000 soldiers under his command and he like totally believed nor are this stuff he believed in that so yeah that guy was gay general Stubblebine word when he was head of Army Intelligence in Arlington would try and walk through his wall because he told me one time he said like he said what is the a term mostly made up of space what is the wall mostly made up of atoms I mean to me the key word he would like stand up from behind his desk and like you know basically run into you shoulda asked him what's an atom bomb made up you fucking idiot he said let me show you he said he would like he bruised his nose for the doctor as well he said fortunately he was going through a messy divorce at the time so like like other people in his office just assumed it was like in his wife beat him up but in fact he was trying to live he's probably are gonna get away from this wall walk an asshole he was had emerged the spaces between them for the war sutton's but he just got something his nose yeah yeah this is this is this is yeah this is fun this my couple years when I did that sci-fi show we did a whole segment on remote viewing and we actually had a guy who claimed to be a successful remote viewer and we we set up this location and asked him me and DJ Grothe oh yeah yeah who's a skeptic very nice guy and and you know DJ was just as accurate just guessing right cuz this guy was yeah I think actually now that I think about I think DJ was more accurate you know the yeah the kind of dark secret of the remote viewing world I mean I can't you can't sort of totally blame the remote viewers for this but so the remote viewing unit at made got Declassified I'm shut down so a lot of these remote viewers then set up their own training centers including our Danes in I didn't maybe in Vegas um or someone up for me so Edie Dame's had this student called magneto it was a woman called Court maeín and there was his other student I've got no names anyway but they would then so ed Dame's taught them remote viewing these two people who would then go on the art Belle show and it became like lie you know regular guests on the hell show and they're the ones identities two of ed dames and students they're the ones who basically announced on the Belle show that the hale-bopp comet had a companion object in its tail they'd remote viewed the the help of comet that was about to pass over the earth had a companion object in its tail and listening to the art Belle show was the heavens gate group so they decided that that was the spaceship they were waiting for yes so they all killed themselves to get on the spaceship prudence Calabrese they and another guy who's named Africa good lord yeah so that's the sort of way it butterfly effective that's hilarious yeah that whole thing was such it's amazing what people want to believe now this could when it goes back to conspiracy theorists or whether it's the remote viewers or even someone who would watch that guy's karate videos and think that he's really doing death touches he's talking about he has a method of going through the skin that attacked the organs like oh you showed me a photograph of well actually he accidentally showed me a photograph of him karate chopping a goat yeah he did that he did the death touch on a goat hmm a lot of well you could fuck a goat up if you hit it in the right spot yeah a lot of indignities would meet it out to goats in the US military I've got you're actually pretty tough though now that I think about it I bet you probably couldn't kill a goat with a karate chop right you have to really hit it hard in the right spot like in the neck is it true that in the movie adaptation of my book the minister at goats there's a kind of bit of comedy where somebody thinks that they fell victim to the death touch but but it happened like years later like 25 years ago he was given the better touch and now he's dying from it 25 years later was in the movie I was in the movie is it true in like the death touch world in the Dimmick world isn't true that some people think like you can touch them now that's the moment is it true in the Death Punch world that people think you can do the Dimmick on someone and they die years later of seemingly natural causes I'm sure that someone who believes that sure yeah yeah I mean if you see that guy that was just having did you see that guy who did all the crazy stuff and the guy falls down you might have missed it yeah but that's the NuLu that's the movie based oh oh you mean oh yeah the other guy right he does obviously you think an English with other one for you he does all these crazy like fake karate moves yeah yeah there's people that believe all kinds of crazy stuff well you know he definitely inspired the cart system anesthetic goats Murphy have you ever seen what happens when one of these fake death touch guys fights a real fighter no did they kind of get to shake oh it's horrific there's a few of them right and these guys just don't seem to learn one of them that was recently in China was so was so poorly received that the guy who was the MMA fighter had to go into hiding because he beat the living fuck out of this guy in like ten seconds like the guy came out and did all this crazy stuff and smashes him in the face MMA style and his kung-fu was no good this day watch this so you get the young gun orange shoes who's like a legit fighter and then the other guy who is this silly death touch guy dressed up like he's in a different century and like watch how this goes down because it's it's horrible because this guy on the left with the orange sneakers on is a real trained fighter and this other guy has a real belief in this system that he's been practicing under and he has no idea that it's horseshit and the way he finds out that it's horseshit is on YouTube I mean he literally finds out in this moment that what he probably believed it he brought probably believed that what he does is actually real and effective so check this out it's horrible to get together bah bah bah they go over what you're supposed to do or whatever and they make him shake hands yep I shake hands and then they go back and then they get the party started and it takes 10 seconds here we go ready set go there goes those guys like literally doing like some movie stuff and boom a guy just starts teeing off it's horrible oh I mean it literally lasts once he engages in the last 10 seconds but that's because one of them is doing an actual martial art and the other guy is practicing nonsense and he's probably practiced that nonsense his whole life he thought it was real there's another one where there's an old man and that's even harder to watch because this old man gets kicked in the face and you just go oh Jesus Christ like save this guy this is horrible and he looks like legitimately like let's watch what he does back it up to the beginning so he bet $5,000 check this out like he what he thinks he can do he claimed it 200 and erech look he's not even touching these people they just go flying it's like they're a part of a cult you know so they move at him and he really firmly believes that he can do this look he's like manip joining them like he's a puppet master it's so crazy so this guy is so he's so like hypnotized by his own bullshit that he decides that's gonna come by right well he's I don't know see here's the thing because he actually makes a real fight with a real trained martial artist so he might he may very well have been in on it himself I mean not in on it men mean what I mean is he might have been taken by his own bullshit he might have actually believed it so now he's gonna fight an actual a young actual martial artist and so he's got this crazy idea that he's just gonna like give that guy the hex and the guy's gonna go flying through the air like the other guy was teaching but this kid just sort of circles him for a few seconds and then just like that other video beats the holy fuck out of them inside of about ten seconds just zoom off until they engage yeah it's like here goes see he's like dude craziness and the young martial artist just grabs him punches him kick some and he's like you see he like he's holding his faces like what the fuck and the young guy is really nice like he's like you okay you want to keep going and he's holding his mouth look the young guy like literally says look does he want to keep going let's stop let's stop this guy's bleeding out of his nose and so he says keep going he says I'm fine and so he gets his hands up because this time it's gonna work this time I'm gonna hit him with the full voodo in this case just blam blam blam and then this kick boom that's that was where it gets horrific and that guy was probably like 60 mmm it's not not a good time to get kicked in the face you know in the military I'm amending I don't think about the minister it goes that much it was so long ago but now I'm remembering some of the other some of the other stuff that they were doing and there was a lot of weaponry stuff you know there was there was the prophet hologram all of this sort of came from this central well of like you know eighties Billy prophet hologram yeah that they would they never like got it off the ground but what they were trying to do was have a hologram of Allah that they would project over an enemy Capitol well I'm alle would basically say whatever the US military wanted him to say Americans aren't that bad yes they say god bless President Bush they had a race-specific stink bomb I wish again their never managed to get off the ground what about the gay bomb they were at the gay bomb that was real yeah oh yeah they literally were engineering some sort of a chemical warfare device that would turn men homosexual yeah and and what's less known about it is that they were also trying to do a halitosis bomb so that you turn the enemy gay and then given bad breath yeah we gave him bad breath and I'd be like so freaked out that the Americans would have come in and win wow they would just have shame all around yeah they they had attack attack bees that would again just attack the enemy none of these things got off the ground I don't think well I guess it's sort of like writing comedy you throw a lot of shit against the wall like 1/10 of it sticks yeah and some things did stick right I mean they did the Taser came from the military but that seems totally reasonable though everybody knows you can get electrocuted yeah I figure out a way to get a large charge into a small device yeah and there was all those kind of weird our old Harold technique so they would do at Guantanamo and I put gray I Romeo or oral yeah yeah where they would like play exactly template subliminal sounds blast they'd blast like Metallica at people but laced into Metallica would be these like subliminal sounds that would try and like hypnotize people do you remember one needs to do that in movie theaters hungry popcorn they'd have like subliminal images they would like in between like yes one one yeah like one frame has ever been shown that that actually works I'm not sure that I ever worked and they I met this guy oh my god I just remembered so I met this guy called Jamal al-harith who had been released from Guantanamo and he was telling me about all of this stuff he was in glad to him for like two years and then he got released and he was telling me about the stuff he said they played him and Tyus CD of of a Fleetwood Mac covers band normal in guantánamo at normal volume those guys were just fucking winging it what was going on I don't know were they doing it to be nice maybe they thought you were a fan I want to make it more pleasant he said it was quite animate they weren't trying to be nice anyway I saw interviewed to my allow Harris he was telling me about all of this weird shit and a few months ago he goes and fucking joins Isis and blows himself up somewhere this guy the Fleetwood Mac cover band oh yeah Wow so when they arrested him and brought him to Guantanamo Bay was he innocent of those charges well he certainly convinced everybody that he was and in fact Tony Blair got involved and helped get him out of one on to be a jihadi what I don't know but I'd be very curious to find out which is exactly the question that you just posed like was he always right or did the experience of being in Guantanamo somehow like years later you know helped to turn him into a jihadi I don't know the answer to what you don't think if you're an innocent person and for two years they take away your freedom yeah and they make you listen to Fleetwood Mac cover van you probably feel like I can't get over that man right it's stained it's stained my soul I have no idea but I met this guy very personable young man I met him at a hotel in Manchester Wow I interviewed him for the minister it goes and where do you where did he kill himself Oh common Bertie can you can be killed other people as well Jamar I don't know Jamal al Haas also heartbreakingly from around that time Omar Bakri who was the guy the jihadist I made a film about his Sony had this really sweet little kid the son Mohammed who was really scared that like his father might get hurt because he was like so public and open and he would like confide in us so you know he was scared that his father would get hurt fucking two years ago joins out is the son joins Isis tries to leave Isis oh so Isis kill him uh-oh now all these kill these people I'm new 20 years good I tell you all the worse they would go to Bala killed ready carried out to suicide car bombing and I'm asking you army base yeah Jesus Christ I know I know what does that feel like when you you hear that I lose someone that became a suicide I was I was well tomorrow I just met that one time and but still you knew him yeah well I met him that one time if I had someone on my podcast to turn out to be a suicide bomber well you did who know you you mean F no no oh you're saying I didn't I didn't no no tell me something I thought you were saying that you did but no well I did have a guy on my podcast that almost beat a woman to death after he was on and now he's in jail for life it was a very public story and I'm a fighter named war machine his name's John John koppenhaver right and he apparently found this girl he was dating but they broke up he found her in bed with another man and one up beating him and beating her like half to death like ruptured her liver broke her ribs smashed her face broke her teeth horrific horrific and she is she was here with him what do you think it was steroids do the good was psychopathy um all the above I think steroids probably played a factor traumatic brain injury probably paid a factor I think that's what they say about Chris Benoit mm-hmm it's a huge factor because these guys they they get hit in the head so many times and no there's no one could tell you when it's gonna go bad no one knows and it's it varies like you might be able to take a hundred punches for me it might be thirty you know it no one knows it doesn't it doesn't really make sense yeah and you don't know what they're absorbing in training versus what happens in actual fights in you know and what the effect it has on one person is very different the effect it has on another person also how yeah how much time is in between these beatings that they've received are they receiving them on a regular basis that change them like instantaneously I know far too many people that have experienced a lot of a lot of shots to the head where it's completely changed who they are right yes guy was troubled to begin with I mean he saw his father die beaten up by cops wasn't that the story I think that was a story it's not something fucked up experienced at a very young age I wonder whether you know that this book was a psychopath test and I met a martial-arts guy once I got like a road rage instance with this guy I've had like opened my son was one at the time and like left out of the car and I said my son's in the car and he said I don't give a fuck about your son and afterwards when I got the psychopathy test I was remember this guy is being like I wonder whether he was a psychopath I wonder whether like given that one of the items on the psychopathy checklist is like grandiose sense of self-worth I wonder whether whether the mixed martial artist world given that you know whether it sort of attracts Psychopaths well it certainly attracts people that aren't opposed to violence right because they're engaging in violence and it also attracts people that are just like they might have been BMX riders or skateboarders or skydivers they love the extreme danger aspect of it they're thrill-seekers and what I the way I described the described mixed martial arts is high-level problem-solving with dire physical consequences and that's really essentially what it is and these guys are attracted to these extreme experiences so some of them are very pleasant people some of them are very nice like like for instance Mighty Mouse it's probably the best pound-for-pound fighter ever if you met him you would never know he's the best fighter in the world he's the sweetest guy he's so normal very articulate easy to talk to doesn't get hit a lot either though he's so slick and smart and the way he fights is so clever but some of them get a lot and you know now that we're knowing more and more essentially every day about the effects of traumatic brain injuries and concussions and you're seeing more and more these stories of football players doing crazy things and I'm sure you saw that recent study where they tested a hundred and eleven football players and they found a hundred and ten of them had traumatic brain injuries Wow what I know that that's what they said about Chris Benoit maybe that's why he oh yeah for sure those guys get it for sure and people say well that's fake wrestling listen man there's nothing fake about what those guys go through they might be choreographed they might have a bunch of things that they're doing but these guys are body slamming each other and throwing each other through the air and landing on each other and hitting each other with elbows that is a hundred percent real and they suffer and and you have to be tough to do that they're they're experiencing some severe pain mm-hmm and then today forensic exam he's Chris Benoit's brain forensic exam consistent with numerous brain injuries CTE which is found in all regions of his brain chronic traumatic encephalopathy you know I wrote a piece about Crispin for the Guardian and when it came out a one o'clock in the morning the press officer for WWE followed me up and yelled at me Sheldon what in the morning because I said what I like I tricked them into like spending time backstage at WWE when I was only interested in Chris Benoit you know it was this did you write the did you meet go backstage before he killed people now it was after it was afterwards oh yeah I'm sure they tricked them oh I think I tricked them how the fuck could they think that you were gonna put a positive spin on someone murdering their family exactly what I was gonna put less emphasis on Chris Benoit and more emphasis on you know the nice things about wrestling no Jesus Christ but you they knew you're gonna put some emphasis on it right yeah whatever that's um lots of questions so they must have known yeah yes speaking of nice people by the way neither my own people it was probably the loveliest year of my working life really in people yeah they would you feel like you girl worked on like maybe I don't know a couple days a lot of digging sounded like dicking with your accent they did a lot of dicking I didn't know denying I'm sure they explained yourself I'm just joking I know I was it was tracing the butterfly effects of Fabian's business plan on their world yeah it was such a kind of interesting exercise you know to to try and let work what's the farthest ripple I could find like what lie you know so Fabian has this idea about giving the world free porn and then that leads to that and that needs to Latin Alice about like where what's the farthest I could find the furthest consequence it was such a sort of fun exercise coupled with the fact that being around porn people was a little bit like being on a Broadway show backstage you know these like you know theater people yong-seok coupled with all of that and the fact that I was in LA and I got to like her now in LA it was it was a really fun yeah can I tell you by the way like one of the strangest consequences that sure yes so this you know that pretty much every child in in the world gets to learn about sex the pornhub these days pornhub is sex education for like every 12 year old I'm sure the parents probably don't get around talking about it in time exactly it's like you know I think when we were growing up maybe I don't know 14 was probably maybe about the age that we started like seeing ripped out pages of Playboy oh yeah britches and so on I mean it was 12 we would find him in the woods okay I have a whole bit on it in my act yeah that's yeah about finding perversion let's true story I literally didn't know about perversion until I found a fucked up magazine in the woods right what was the magazine it was like a think it was called foot action or something like that night was very strange but here's what's weird that kids today if you give them a phone like I mean what age to kids get a phone like some kids get a phone at like ten a nine you're essentially giving them porn yeah you're giving them three awfulness you given them I suspected yeah yeah yeah so anyway so I was really interested in like so what are the consequences of this have like 12 year old kids learning about sex the pornhub I found this terrible consequence in Oklahoma so this was a boy called Nathan with autism so he was like an awkward kid with autism trying to like chat up a girl but didn't know how to do it so he thought that the smartest dude I thought you know he thought he should text her lines of dialogue that he'd heard in porn films so he texted her first he texted her a bunch of hentai porn photographs and she didn't respond so I said lie if she'd responded what would you have done he said I would have stopped like if she said can you stop sending me these what would you have done he said I would have stopped sending them I just assumed she was busy so then he texted her a line of dialogue that he heard in a porn film and it was I want to bend you over and rape you from behind so he is now on the sex offenders registry for 25 years which means he has to live in a house right at the edge of town because he has to be 2,000 feet away from parks and day care centers he can't go anywhere where children go so he can't go to football games basketball games he can't go to the pool was he he was 17 and a half I think maybe 18 but kids as young as 8 years older on the sex offenders registry in the United States eat eight years old I had no idea boys and girls by the way like if you play there's this little boy they were like playing this game would they take their clothes off in the dark and then put their clothes back on quickly I bunch of 9uo kids or something this one kid kept his clothes off when they turned the lights on the girl complained to her parents and this boy is on the sex offenders register so you can't like if it's so with Nathan first of all where the fuck were the parents right you unsurprisingly it's like I think this kid was a foster kid so there's already like the sort of stigma attached to the shadow of stigma Nathan's a kid with autism so I I said to this woman who like defends children on the sex offenders registry I said to Elijah you know why why doesn't the judge just say this is ridiculous and third out of court and she said you know there's this kind of prevailing view that a it's better to protect you know it's better to err on the side of caution but also there's this prevailing view that if a kid starts acting sexually weird at the age of ten that's a kind of precursor for them being sexually weird maybe but maybe not yeah exactly I mean I'm sure it's true in certain cases that I'm sure it's not what the consequences of sentencing a kid like that are so extreme like you should probably have a real understanding of what's going on with a kid yeah and if he's autistic and he doesn't know what the fuck to do and he's confused and he yeah well Nathan said he read me like his book he needs to like fill out this sex offenders book like at therapy and so he was like reading me the koalas you know I think he's like about 20 now he's gonna be on the sex offender registry for the next 23 yes no what is it like talking to him is he well did you understand the consequences well went down yeah he says it's like being permanently grounded he was reading me the questions and answers from the sex offenders book so it's questions like have you ever had a sexual situation in which you're in or feces was involved was like no there were questions like you know have you ever had sex with animals and his question was like no and then the last question was when was the last time you had sex with somebody and his answer was still a virgin so uh virgin on the sex offenders registry Wow I mean you can only because you can understand what girl was scared to no I told her parents and the parents told the police like you can tell you understand it from the other point of view Oh however son yeah yeah but you know I mean what a butterfly effect that is yeah and I'm not of course I'm not saying any this is Fabian's folk this is all that intended no that's fine did consequences that's just access to sex and porn and you know the other thing that's weird is that porn for the most part I mean other than this bespoke porn which is very specific but porn there's like levels to the depravity that never existed before yeah cuz everything's keywords search for these like this is what happens when you let tech people roam the world and what's also you're ramping up it's also people get tired of just people kissing and then having sex yeah so then it's like I want to watch a guy girl up oh I want to watch a guy spit in a girl's mouth I want to watch it get smacked around and then it gets weirder and gagging and yeah exactly that so that's one consequence of the ability of like you know free porn is just a sheer volume of yeah you gotta stand out with extreme content somewhere but the other thing is all these search engine people are sort of looking at what's being searched for the most what is number one well I tell you what I tell you what's like a room I don't know if it's no boom but I tell you what's really like way at the top it's anything to do with like stepsisters stockbrokers stepfathers stepdaughters moms incest porn is basically it's basically it's not real interest in a way with it but actually when I was on the set of stepdaughter cheerleader Archie palm grazer the director like there was a bit of dialog like these guys will I say go I like I think your stepdaughter is sexy oh is that but I kept on getting it wrong and I was saying I think your daughter's sexy much going step don't let that backfired the cameras going stepdaughter yeah we don't want to be too fucked up here people step keyword step go right now take one these are great people and people with great people well that's nice you know and that sort of shatters some of the stereotypes of people about porn that the people are sleazy and uncaring and doing coke yeah smacking each other this show if I may blow my own trumpet please do which I learned on the set of blow my own turnip it I I did a little bit from the butterfly effect on stage at the Ace Hotel down in Los Angeles here in Los Angeles and we invited a bunch of her porn people along and they said to us afterwards like 25 years of being important we were the first mainstream people to come along and not treat them as like you know ingredients in our pre-existing ideology so not pitying them or attacking them just treating them on a level as a fellow human being and isn't that kind of nuts that that's rare in porn because we all feel the sort of society as mainstream journalists we feel these kind of societal pressures to to in some way attack them you know they're right there to be pitied there to be hated you know I think you also have to establish that your own whether it's moral superiority or good taste that you you don't approve of this you're not one of those people exactly yeah I'm not even a connoisseur of this work right exactly I made my excuses and left that was you know yeah and and that means you know because of our hypocrisy they get exploited mmm so that's why I wanted to do this this show I'm sorry that I said I bought it back no no worries full circle but that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do this when I first moved to California I was on this sitcom called news radio and one of the guys who was a writer on news radio was a writer for porn films on the side and what it was was it didn't really pay much but it gave him access to the girls and let him meet these girls and he was kind of a nebbish she sort of dorky guy and he had never been around like a real bombshell girl that was willing to have sex with him before so all of a sudden he's having sex these porn stars but they get to have sex with these guys on set and it was like some of this weird thing they like this is his girlfriend but she would go to work and get the shit fucked out of her by a bunch to forget and how did he feel about that this is what the straw that broke kills back he was having dinner with her and she's like I'm so tired I'd do an anal scene all day today and he was like what like he was out they were out to dinner and he like hid in his mind he was able to put that barrier up and what she does is just work it's fine you know we're gonna go to dinner and have a wonderful time candlelight fine wine some amazing food I'd in love with her she made him do that nope she was tired she was complaining about take it in the ass all day and he was like check please let's get out of here so they split up I got another one it wasn't my friend but it was a friend of a friend who told me this story that uh this guy was dating this girl and you know just the same thing so like hey you know it's what she does relive and no big deal and he read her contract and he goes what's airtight and airtight is a dick in every hole and he was like check please I can't so the guy the first guy though took me to a set and this is like in 94 ok so this was the pretty key woods pretty fabian days it's pre-internet and they were all rich everybody was rich and the porn stars were like real stars it was Jeannine and Jill Kelley who are very famous porn so I was a lesbian scene and there was a scene like there was a cartoon character a comic-book character this woman wrote she came to life and they were having a lesbian scene together but it was it was really weird because like like she knew that we were watching and so there was like this it was just like air of the Hat Racal enthusiasm that was very forced like they would do the scenes like I love my job I love my job my job is amazing and I look at my friend at the time and yeah I don't know if I'm buying all this I was like this just seems weird I remember Mike quasi sent me on my first porn set this director who he kind of embedded ourselves with said to me you'll find there's a wisp of dark mr. everybody who does this really thing yeah whispered that's what's fascinating like I what its it like it's illogical if you look at it on paper it's like everyone who is healthy whose body functions correctly enjoy sexual relations whether it's straight sex or gay sex or whatever the fuck it is people like to be touched it's part of being a person why is it so shameful when other people get to watch and why is it why does it devastate people when they find out that their loved one had done something on film that others can see and when they leave porn this is another new Lisa Fabian I look at in my in the show is that when they leave porn it's much more likely that the you know the Li pona go to a different part of America they start a new life it's much more likely that they'll be noticed than in the 90s like in the 90s for an ex-porn star to be outed someone was have to go to like a DVD sharpen like bro these days everybody you know just watch his 20 porn films for five seconds each until they found the one that you know they want to jack off to so it's much more likely that a former porn star will be spotted and outed and as a consequence by it like I was talking to this guy called Dale Rutter his porn name is Dale de Beaune he got a job as a nurse in a hospital and Human Resources called him in and said to him are you Dale de Beaune he said yeah and said we have to fire you because like if any patient says you even looked at her the wrong way like they in court yeah so Porter and Dale said that his recognizability has gone up massively since pornhub and free porn came along yeah he should be married to people recognize them yeah you're a pervert yeah I'm just doing a job you fuck there was a woman who got arrested not arrested rather fired she was a schoolteacher and they turn it turned out that in the 90s or something like that she had done porn and she was like really well respected very loved school teacher and then one of the kids in school figured it out I started telling everybody next thing you know kids are getting online yeah and watching she lost her job and she was like really really respected and loved and then you know we don't love you anymore you used to fuck yeah I know I I it's it's baffling you know even in these sort of sex-positive more sex-positive kind of empty slut-shaming times Estella yeah that's not real yeah well it's a bubble it's a small that most of the world doesn't J well that's the other thing it's like what about other countries like is this stigma attached to there wasn't there like in Italy a former porn star ran for Parliament didn't started going out with the artist Jeff Koons oh he's like a big like famous sort of pop artist and I think they were having a relationship and yes she she asks you went for Britain is still that stigma I'm sure yeah I know it wasn't your fuck okay a little wild over there yeah yeah let me know what I would wonder like what countries are the most accepting of former adult stars adults as the other might be my favorite term adult it's like what you know it's like urban you know like we say urban use just say black people Jesus Christ adults say porn just say porn I said did the adult industry like what do you mean the industry of people are grown up like what do you say I'm definitely stupid like what adults as opposed to what the children industry the fuck you saying yeah it's just a weird term well I hope - of the butterfly effect because it's so just it just shows them to be just you know just like the rest of us ordinary sweet fucked up mmm nice you know mixtures and they are yeah people I hope it will do its bit ya think I should go now do you think you should go now you said enough what do you think I think it was great we had a great talk this would be a good way to end it I enjoyed it very much I'm gonna meet my family and go to Runyon and have her oh that's a good place yes you do that all the time yes good spot I could learn every day when I'm in lesson oh so it was such a pleasure always let's do it again for sure I would love to connect you very much thank you and tell people how they could find your stuff okay so this new series is called the butterfly effect and it's on audible audible.com a big fan of horrible I also love it they're amazing there you go it's the butterfly the biggest collection of audio entertainment on the entire Internet and look at that star rating beautiful look at you use a - so that's value and my Twitter thing is just that Jon Ronson and Jo oh yeah any other things I wrote this co-wrote this movie
