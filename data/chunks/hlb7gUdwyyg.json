the girag and experience I apparently you don't need an ID to fly you just need to go there like we need to put you through like 20 security test so come to the airport at two hours early I was like yeah damn it they're gonna molest you yeah yeah have you ever had that happen before we get like roughly frisked no but I have gotten yelled at by a TSA agent because I didn't want to go through the body scanner and he was like what he is celebrity he's like only celebrities don't want to go through the body scanner and I was like why I was like this is crazy that you're talking to me like this like what the fuck this is nuts yeah it's an option isn't it yeah yeah you're just like totally demeaning me and Ike in front of everyone why she's a nice why would celebrities not want to go through it the new ones like a radio like yeah why would you want to get molested I mean it well it's I've never had it happen to me everyone has always been pleasant with me but Graham Hancock who's been on the podcast several times yeah oh yeah he went through one and he said this dude like just was aggressively sexual with him like grabbing his body like it felt like he was being molested like I shouldn't say aggressively sexual but he grabbed his cock and the whole thing mean like he said it felt like he was getting raped like obviously not as extreme but you know it's like a form of a violation and he was really shocked by it and he wrote about it he was shocked enough that he didn't just let it go sat down I wrote some stuff about well there was just this report that came out that said that there's so many more cases of malfeasance and misconduct and the TSA than any other government I mean this is like 20 times more and so there was this investigation done to find out what why is there so much fucking like crimes happening like robbery sexual abuse and stuff and it was and basically this representative figured out that they don't really do background checks oh my god and they're just kind of skipping through this huge you know you think that you would so basically they're hiring pedophiles and child molesters what they found out what yeah no way well not nice people too we should say this er I met a lot of really nice people the TSA and people you fuken government chill relax well how do you think that you should do is secure like we did before nine eleven TSA was totally created in the wake of 911 it's a totally new government agency just like the department homeland security and just I mean think about it the hijackers brought on what knives like you can still bring those in this guy Jonathan Corbett basically exposed the fact that you can just create an in sewing pocket and bring in whatever the fuck you want through these body scanners and so they really have like a huge security breach so but when you go back to why the body scanners were implemented like an in stone pocket that's like silver or something oh so it has to be a sign yeah it's like yeah yeah and you can carry anything through oh wow yeah but I mean the reason that the body scanners were implemented in the first place is michael michael chertoff was uh tied up with rape
