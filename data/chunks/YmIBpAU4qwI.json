hello freak bitches Randall Park ladies and gentlemen happenin good to see you brother good to see you man thanks for coming on here appreciate it you are in the middle of the one of the most controversial movies in the history of the world yeah yeah you are you play I play kim jong hoon yeah in the interview yeah that's rich is fuckin crazy man I didn't think it was crazy when I signed on I realized it was crazy well you know in the midst of all that yeah what is the verdict cuz they say that it's not it's not North Korea someone's think it was an insider at Sony they had it let they had it narrowed down to a woman who hacked it read that you know I don't know I don't know cuz after they came out with that the FBI came out and said no it is North Korea we have a lot of information that we haven't released but it is trust us but then you know the private kind of security experts still think it's not North Korea I would almost always go with private security experts over the FBI almost always I own I kind of feel like most people now would also which is kind of sad you know sad for the FBI but I think most people are questioning it would you be willing to go over there ever count one yeah do you mean like do you mean North Korea specifically oh yes very specific no no no over there I would never go there over there under the guidance of Dennis Rodman no no I I would say I wouldn't go near Dennis Rodman in America I would not go near him but I would not go near North Korea at all I mean if the regime topples changes and you know I don't know 20 years from now it what's the likelihood of that though I don't know I don't know I think it's about I think it's possible but you know in our lifetimes I think but yeah that's the only way I'd go we were talking about this before the podcast started there think exchange flash drives yeah back and forth to each other yeah I like in the a huge part of the underground economy there is basically these flash drives with with South Korean TV shows movies American movies you know just glimpses into the outside world that they're not supposed to see it's a huge underground market so I think I mean the people there especially the younger people living they know what's going on you know and if they get caught not only they fucked yeah okay well this is what I've read and I don't know how it is now it might be even worse now for all I know but yeah if they get caught they go to a labor camp for I don't know how long it's like a three generational thing they're their kids go to a labor camp there and their parents will go like the whole family ends up being punished for their action which is wild it's insane yeah and when we hear about like dictatorships like that we always think of it like that's from like the forties so you know you think of it as it is from the 40s that's a Bing and it just has not changed over there yeah I just wonder what it would take for something like that to be toppled and we were also talking before the podcast started about his uncle his uncle I was planning some sort of coup so yeah killed his uncle killed his uncle's sons yeah yeah I mean well one thing that happened when our when our movie was about to come out there was like some expert on on North Korea who said that it's important that the elite in Pyongyang see this movie especially the people in the you know the government and it working it because it's so it's so they're on such shaky ground right now that for them to see something like this could like really help in getting something to happen over there this is what Sony was saying no no this was like an expert on like some professor or something on North Korea which I thought was interesting but yeah that kind of blew my mind when he said that Wow imagine if it did imagine if that was the catalyst if our our ridiculous comedy Seth Rogen James Franco movie the catalyst for overthrowing the last great Communist dictator yeah I mean old-school communist dictatorship yeah it's crazy I mean it's all you know so much of it is is is this kind of deification you know of him yeah and all of this stuff you know our movie but not just that even just glimpses into the outside world it just chips away at that you know and he becomes who he is you know to these people and and to other people and you know in the government and and and that does not help their cause you know alright the government or Kim Jong Un's cause you know what is the Dennis Rodman thing what's did you research him at all when you did I did yeah I mean kim jong hoon include and his father Kim jong-il when he was alive huge NBA fans he was a huge basketball fan he was like a loved Michael Jordan and there's a story of Kim jong-un supposedly he was when he was a student he went to like an international school in Switzerland and there are accounts of him from other students he just sit in class all day and draw doodle pictures of Michael Jordan like literally in this class so like he was obsessed with basketball and in that era and I think you know that Bulls team was running things at the time like Rawdon just - he was a huge rodman fan Wow yeah that's so crazy it's so crazy see Rodman over there hanging out with him is so surreal so did you see that at that press conference no there's a video of like a press conference where he's basically sitting there with with the other play of some other players who went with him on this trip and he's clearly drunk and he's basically justifying his you know his actions by going over there and you know becoming friends with this guy and he's like drunk and this is a press conference from Korea or from America I think it was in Korea that they shot that they shot it and you could see the players behind him and they just looked super uncomfortable Jews well how could you not be super uncomfortable first of all hanging out with Dennis Rodman make you super uncomfortable Dennis Rodman calling a press conference yeah no worries man we still we kicked things off Randall we're good nice just we had to cover the interview anyway we had to go over all the crazy shit going through artist formerly known as Kim Jong did you at any point in time feel like you fucked up now yeah you know no no I was out this is the thing I wasn't like scared before my life I'm scared this is the thing there were enough people like you friends family people who were genuinely scared for my life that had got me thinking like shut up you scared for my life well you have Secret Service we had guards at the house what yeah yeah Sony provided us cars that long it's like a couple weeks what the fuck Sony yeah at first I was like we don't need guards seriously we don't need guards they're like let's listen let us just give you some car just for peace of mind I was like all right all right and then what and then one day they were just gone like a few weeks later they were gone and I was thinking oh my god where the guards I need the guards you know like I was just so you know I felt so protected by them when I did it wouldn't have otherwise you know I just got used to and then my friends being so concerned for me it just kind of got me paranoid did anyone contact you did you get any threats or did anybody know no one on Twitter like pretended to be from North Korea and fucked with you know we should have done it I you know I mean I would get like spam mail like I always get and I would think twice about you like wait a minute is this like regular spam or is this like hack into my email destroy my life spam and but I you know I didn't know I would never have I just kind of deleted it like I always do you know yeah you're always in fact I was paranoid and related yeah yeah most likely but I you know I got paranoid I got paranoid after a while and then the movie came out and like we were talking about earlier it just all died out the dust settled really quickly it was like crazy it was like the biggest news and then all of a sudden I don't know
