we're live about this Lori's about we're talking about G gordon liddy so G go and Lynn this episode of Miami Vice was a sergeant in Vietnam and right when Saigon fell he held on to 300 kilos of pure heroin he took it to the United States and dead bodies this what the episodes about 1986 Miami Vice they bring it to Miami and he sat on it the 20 years until the value and all the way up just like an investment and then he let it loose but by that time I had got a contaminated started killing junkies all up and down the East Coast what a brilliant episode Wow so they had to go in and dig for g-goo and Libby and this motherfucker shows up right slate this board meeting that's when I had to leave the house he shows up to his boardings like yeah the heroin was my Baba because I guarantee they called him sergeant real estate and the episode he cuz I guess you guys forget who the hell I am he turns around he goes in this briefcase and he throws a chain of he is on the table when he walks out oh that's it that's the other son tremendous and this isn't 80 what this is 86 to Simpson on Miami this is way before American Gangster was talking about it this was already out that they were bringing Viet heroin and dead bodies and that's how the episode starts the reporter takes Don Johnson to the morgue and he opens it up in Vietnam he goes this is your friend stick your handle and it was just pure heroin that was what they did right I said they were doing towards the Allen or the beginning that was but it was really the CIA they're blaming it all on some black guy from Harlem you know there's a guy named mr. nice I forget what his name is something banks famous drug dealer mm-hmm when he said was it wasn't the CIA what it was is some people in the CIA he said it's some Cowboys in the CIA and that's what makes the most sense to me like this idea that the the big organization the CIA would be involved in drug smuggling seems like so crazy Joe Rogan it's true many he has plenty of people there's plenty of people that did do it look there's plenty of examples like there's an example right now this thing called the Silk Road you know about the Silk Road the Silk Road was this underground drug dealing like network that this guy had created and they were just selling mad money Matt mad drugs like underground and they had they created the thing like it's it's it's a total what it is is it operates like completely under the wire and these DEA guys I get was DEA they infiltrated it and they got into the Silk Road one of the first things they did they started stealing money now these guys are in jail they're going to jail right now they're in court right now and they're wondering like whether or not this case is even valid because these guys for sure had access to this guy's account and part of what they were trying to try this guy on is his complicity that he was complicit in the drug selling and there was also some possibility that people were murdered although there was no body there's a lot of kinky shit going on with this and the the kinkiest part of that the agents were stealing money bitcoins yes they were stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin so they they realized that there was a lot of value in this like that shit has always gone on I think the reason why you have guys like this that are showing up in the Silk Road case there's always been Cowboys but I think there's been good guys too there's been guys who are in the CIA that really did it for America I just got Michael Baker and then I'm pretty good at recognizing bullshit you know and he's a longtime CIA operative and a fucking great guy I mean really does seem like he loves America like I don't think he's bullshitting I think there's a lot of those guys they get in those positions and they get a group of them together just like they did with rampart with those fucking bad cops they get a group of them together look what happened they get together look all these guys are making money right fuck them they're all criminals and scumbags and cunts let's just get some of this money man this is get some of this money come on man you're never gonna stop these fucking people this is what we do we keep we keep throwing a few of them in jail we do what everyone fuck we got to do we we were they were the gang here we got the law on our side let's fucking make some money CIA I should have said that you're absolutely right there was factions like yeah a brown bag like a black bag faction that went in after the Marines were going and they shoot everybody and throw cards you know whatever the fuck it was when you have when you're shipping heroin from where I'm gonna fuck that is considered all the way the United States through three or two different ports and people have to unload them and you have you know whatever people walking through your plane when they first come in you know to inspect them that's a lot of people you gotta grease it has to be somebody huge yeah you know this isn't mean you getting a boat and going to Columbia and paying some guy with me and red bat and we just shoot across with police scanners and try our best you know to intimated to infiltrate to to bring in that amount of heroin you have to spend a lot of dough that's where your course come in that's where you've set the wholesale and the retail prices you know years ago it's 20 years ago they would they would smuggle it 60 miles in 70 45 50 miles in from the United States around Miami and they would dump it over boy with weights and 12 hours later the boom would explode and the bales would rise up and you come by a fisherman will come by and put the bales meanwhile the DEA was looking for that boat that was speeding across on their radar but they would throw you know that's that takes expensive equipment to devise something to throw you you know 50 pounds of cocaine a hundred feet under the water and then 12 hours later everything blows and your coke rises to the top and now some guy comes and just picks it up this is brilliant this is really what they did that was one part of the things they do Mike you know have your while to beat the federal government you got a you got and it doesn't listen man what uh what the budget is for fighting drugs and what a drug dealer spends a month I'm talking about a guy that's Brandon a thousand kilos and want the powder whether it be heroin or fucking cocaine that's big powder somebody's gotta be turning around right and they were flooding the market with heroin and I remember being a little boy in New York and going to visit my godmother on my mother's friends and sand people everywhere not early New York to me was a fuckin this shit that then what's the shona where people are dead walking around Atlanta walking I saw that growing up I saw that growing up as a Pedro where they used to have in Harlem Spanish Harlem let's get ro scarier than all those you know they had people nodding at the lights people waiting across the street and they not at the fucking light you know what they don't have though in New York that they have here in LA see New York all these cities have buildings there's like these these streets have their whether these people are it's like these are places where other folks go like you got all your homeless people you got you know your your poor people but there's cars that go through those areas and it's you know it's well-traveled like New York blends more LA has these blocks that are just homeless people when I mean just homeless people I'm talking thousands like there literally might be a thousand bouncer on this block oh dude you feel them oh yeah you make a wrong turn and you get right in the middle and it's a Michael Jackson video yeah it really is it's insane yeah it's downtown there's a weak spot what they call Skid Row it's actually says if you go on google map and type Skid Row Los Angeles it actually says Skid Row there's a like a mile I mean it's a couple blocks wash there's a little lot there's a lot of it there's more than one area there's like one long street but we used to work when we did Fear Factor we used to work in these buildings and these buildings were a lot of them abandoned textile buildings or they were renting him out so we're American Apparel actually has made it's really weird we were in the American Apparel Factory we had to go through the American Apparel Factory to get to the roof and watch them like make their clothes you know they're like they do make them in downtown LA it's like one of the things they pride themselves in jesus fucking christ Joey Jess but we would go to the top of these um hang up on it Jesus Christ you check and see the fucking is the that's alright we would go to the top of these buildings and you could you could literally there's areas where you know you could see them like leaking out into the the rest of streets and if you drove down there you jordana Street I'm not bullshitting you would see hundreds hundreds of homeless people just swarming the streets and there's these areas where they have like it's crazy Joey they have these areas where they have like they give them food or they have you know areas where they can get medical assistance stuff like that and areas are particularly dense now when I shot my PD blue I shot her at a downtown location that's for the pool hall trying to sort and that time for homeless people while I was standing I heard people going in talking about how they had day rentals the government would pay for 15 days and they'd be on the street for 15 days I didn't see that see like that Advil this is this one seems mild compared to what I saw when was this what year is this welcome maybe they've cleaned it up a little what that's also during the day I've gone through the night oh yeah statistics were the staple in every city and it's out of proportion some cities more than others yeah pause on that for a second Skid Row's in the area downtown LA mm says the population the district was 17,000 740 Skid Row's de fun is just oh my god what the fuck does that mean does it defined in a decision by Jones versus city of Los Angeles is the area east of Main Street south of 3rd Street and west of Alameda Street so it's kind of like a block it's like an area but that area has 17,000 homeless people is that right that's a goddamn Kevin Hart concert Kevin Hart sold out Madison Square Garden three fucking shows in a row he's a monster he's a lot of time he's she's the biggest comedian of all time Kevin no one's ever been as big as Kevin Hart as far as like popularity no one even close I can't think of one person I think there's a couple guys that like that up to that edge but I think he's totake anit to a totally different stratosphere I gained got pretty far he got on that edge Louise on that edge but Kevin Hart is like routinely doing these crazy arena shows he's doing 40,000 plus people or he sold 40,000 plus tickets already for a show in Philly where he's filming a special dude it's just in total next level positive energy shit if you go to that kid's Instagram page his Instagram is all about like positive like energy like get going to work I'm doing what I love to do I'm working it shows him in the gym putting work in because five K's with people and they bounce and shit you see that they would chase them last weekend she never flew into the five fucking K that mother reality show you know he's got a cod pool he's a man ain't never found it's got his own line on underwear do whatever the fuck he wants he's an animal it would suck keep going in those concerts though and being like the back that cannot be enjoyable hearing my huge screens huge screens and the way they Saku Stickley set up these things used to be a problem like I told you that I used to work at great woods this is kind of a funny story because it was during a Bill Cosby Show that there was an issue there Bill Cosby and there was a Rodney Dangerfield show the same issue and the issue was the way great woods are set up it's an amphitheater so you're indoors and part of it and part of it is outdoors and the back of it leads out to this like lawn area or at least it did when I worked there and so you could hear if you were under the canopy there was like an acoustic canopy above all the seats in the front but then the back there was no seats so it's like you had monsters behind you so you try to watch a show like there was one big fight I think I want to say was Judas Priest was a Judas Priest no Jethro Tull it was Jethro Tull there was a Jethro Tull concert and there was a fucking mad riot because people started lighting fires up not in the hood up in the grass area they were just lighting fires and there was not enough of us to sort of like control at all because it was getting really fucking crazy so I put my security jacket I put a hoodie on over my security jacket zipped it up through the hoodie over my head and said fuck this job and I just quit I was like you can't pay me nine bucks an hour to get killed because this is this is fucking madness I saw fistfights my friend Larry who's like well nicest guys in the world punched some guy and I was like I'm fucking that if Larry's hitting people Larry's like the sweetest of sweethearts and I'm like this guy's hitting people I am god this is a madness in the air I got to get the fuck out of here I got pissed off a Jethro Tull concert too cuz he breaks out the flute you just like what the fuck is this people from these coasts we don't like flew stuck like we don't like flutes my point was in the back area the green grass area you couldn't hear the words you didn't understand what the fuck it was it was all echoes it was a lot like people were pissed they go I don't know what the fuck he's saying Andrade was killing too and so was called me cops was killed we were just Jaime and I were talking about red rocks if you've been to Red Rocks you get so impressed with the sound you I cheated I went like an 80 something and then I went like a 90 something and it was like being indoors that's amazing fillers green which is a little smaller I think on the other side of Denver they had an issue there but now even the Hollywood Paul people there what's it popular not too many I think I don't think that's insane what cop you did you do stand-up there they do it they do it there yeah somebody Brody Roy he's doing like a movie night where you'd like host and do some comedy yeah Brody Brody didn't get paid for that one that was one that Brody didn't get paid for they fucked him as money I think so well we were retweeting it yeah he's like oh sorry that's my money for contact number three listen what they did was crazy they did was crazy he had a two shows one was in a small theater and one was in this big theater he's doing this show in the small theater and they go would you like to do a show in the big theater so he goes yeah sure thinking he's gonna get paid they asked him do you want to work he put his name on the bill like he show he tweeted pictures of the lineup they had his name in the lineup it wasn't like a guest set or anything like that it was a guy they had scheduled on the show and nobody wants to go up first you don't want to go up first in front of fucking 15,000 people you want to get the crowd warmed up first Brody had to go up there and do the hardest spot of the night was second hardest by the night the hardest by the night is like following someone who crushes like if you're going on after Diaz that's the hardest part of the night but any but the second hardest part of the hardest part of the night is the first guy the first guy this first couple minutes is kind of like a throwaway you got to kind of get everybody loose get everybody feeling good and then boom hit them in the material that has got to have very few bumps in it because you're trying to hypnotize these fuckers so like the early material it's gotta be like real smooth more herky-jerky the earlier stuff is less likely to trust you you motherfucker you can't even get me a goddamn trance you slipping up your words you know but if you go out there just smooth style and just walk right into it and really know what the fuck you're doing to get things started you you uh you forget about that I forget about that I opened for Callen when he was doing his DVD and I just opened it was first time I had done that in forever I was like ooh this is interesting this is like a different yeah you kind of gotta get everybody you feel it you feel like they're not quite there yet you gotta kind of like massage and four and then then you start the fucking crank it up but make him keep up you know but it's definitely a different thing you gotta slow him down suck him in and then yeah and I did that the story told his show and you know everybody talks about suicide I had a kid that I grew up with Steve Mann Cheney and one day he just said fuck it he went to Carvel he walked his suicide bridge he a this Sunday he took his glasses off he put him down he jumped and that was it they didn't leave a note nothing he was always a little fucking crazy every time you saw him he was quoting albums and shit I get swelling son the firing range so you know he

of like your aren't taking pills because she's bipolar like what are you talking about all her because it was accepted and I was like oh yeah we used to take Valium and well I think it's the opposite I think you just got used to people being fuckin crazy you know you didn't feel like you had to medicate them you know I think people were way more crazy in the 60s and 7 I'd do Johnny Reed I tried to kill him so he jumped off a building he land in a dumpster Johnny wasn't the first that's what people thought but he lived and he give his shit from the government on the first to the bartender and he

you know on the East Coast he locked the bathroom from the outside when you leave a bar at night when they closed up right they locked the bathroom then they put like a lock ball so if you break in they can't he would go in the bathroom Johnny really 11 o'clock in the morning to pee and we locked him in then we leave him in there till like 6 o'clock at night we come back to have a drink we'd open the bathroom and he'd come out like nothing I swear to God nothing happened he was hilarious put my dick on the chair see what happens he's like wow and he just got up so Johnny relived it's like

very smart dude he very good at reading people and you can see like he's like looking around shit when I met you that was the first thing that I noticed when I met when I met you it's like there's at least people that were scared you he was so weird there was all these people that were like nervous around you you know they thought like Joey did is a bad guy like this is like late 90s or whatever

deflate person I was like this is the weirdest shit I've ever seen in my life but back then no one knew what the fuck it was we're talking about like 1988 it was when I was 21 I didn't know what that meant I didn't understand how he got smaller like it didn't make any sense to me like I didn't know anybody that was a bodybuilder or anything so it was just weird it was just weird to see him small and then as I got older and started talking to people especially when I was working at that was working at a gold gym or Nautilus plus that's what it was Nautilus plus in Revere and I knew this dude in there who was a he was a bodybuilder and he kind of schooled me on some of it I go because he was huge and I go do you take steroids and he goes dude fucking look at me what do you think of course I fucking take steroids he was the first guy I ever met it was like super open about it he's like he would wear like those Daisy Duke shorts back then bodybuilders where those Daisy Duke shorts his kid had these fucking giant tanned legs they were enormous tanned Allah he was fucking you I hope that look comes back not even coming back for girls it's over do you think there is certain clothes like that that will never come back like bottoms bell-bottoms I can see bele bhath they try they tried but people realize it's stupid looking I rocked them yeah you know what it worked back when people at long collars see that's the difference if you want to have those long collars that they had in the 60s you know like those those crazy jackets see you see like Jefferson Starship in those and then you have platforms people were wearing platform shoes remember those so like those all worked with the bell bottom right but you get to like flip flops and bell-bottoms flip flops where it gets annoying you're stepping on your bell-bottoms - goofy they get in the way you need stilts you know what's really sad about juicing that people that juice for what do you call aesthetics mm-hmm because yes the further look it always ends up very bad because and I was around and I grew up around it becomes instead of snorting coke or drinking they go to steroids like that did the wrestlers on and there's one thing curiosity and he goes to cop did you see when he copped I didn't see that moving ok this apartment he cops to the gym you know he's copping fucking shit that they gave Nazis like you know that bball this that and you could tell us I too thousand bucks but he got right now and he goes 500 gonna be wrestling with a bag right if you know that world you know that for him that's a six-week supply that's a year's supply then when he has his heart attack in the movie the doctor tells him a good bro - fuck you put later by say you fucking kidding me it's a slow bet because it becomes an addiction I saw it I saw it go from once every six weeks to four cycles a year - fuck ain't getting off it - fuck it I'm gonna die a superstar they call it stacking when the next thing you know you're taking fucking four things and you're not competing you're just gonna bar on Friday nights I never got that in my head I never got that and it always ends bad you see those guys are year later they have a heart attack they get deflated some happens and they go to prison and then they can't do when they come out and you ask them what the tattoos all fucked up now it always ends bad yeah I knew a guy who died yes it always and people you know I watched that documentary and I can't a we contact with each other by talking the stereo one that doesn't harm you and I believe is driving fast yeah I believe that but I also believe that I saw you know you look at these guys down the Jersey Shore all right you look at these guys in Jersey they all got that little bicep when they got time to go to the gym they do four six curls they do a fucking anavar they go suntan they run number fuckin SPF number two and that's the result you get and they do sit-ups that's exactly what they do and they do Diamond push-ups and they blow up for the summer and then they like it prime Tanya I was part of the crew my friends I remember the Chaddock driving back from the show on Sundays how they couldn't wait to get home because it was the second rest day and today was gonna be the biggest play I'm thinking of going home taking a shower and going out because I'm huge it's Sunday it's my second one the second day Sunday you're the biggest that's so these guys on the way home to my off day I'm gonna get some pussy tonight my veins look at my bicep and just driving fucking hilarious it becomes something else man I think it's like I think it's like alcohol like you could drink alcohol you just have a cat but a beer at night you could have a couple of glasses of wine with dinner or you could be that motherfucker that just gets hammered all day every day and we all know that person we all have met a bunch of those people some people just get addicted to shirt day drinkers oh man just a lot of those out there especially in the entertainment business you know what you do whatever the fuck you want and nobody could tell you what to do nobody tells you what to do that's why you're on periscope all day it's also people that I think that that do cocaine right that have an addiction to cocaine drink all day because they can even their their self out supposedly some people that do cop you know I've never done it but people that have done like a lot of it will tell you they do they always want to have something to calm them down afterwards take the edge off of it I didn't snore in the daytime I wasn't a fucking vampire I snorted at night it was fucking my whole day up if I even did a line sometimes he I wanted to have the coke ready at eight o'clock but sometimes I got a guv own I'd have the 60 bucks early in the daytime and I'd shoot over listen got home a fucking slob I go over there and take the 60 I'm gonna have to hide it in my jacket I have to sit there for four hours it's just coke in my jacket calling me in the afternoon so I would do a little bump and then get paranoid and jerk off and it would fuck up my timing at night it would fuck up my whole day so I wouldn't do it in the daytime I was always a nighttime guy so if you did coke during the day it would fuck up your set every day it fucked up everything the rest of my day my my timing because my soul wasn't intact with my central nervous system they were apart now it's apartment you do blowing you go on stage that's why I never understood that concept it always made me laughing people call you funny cuz you do coke and go on stage okay okay you fucking dummy up it frees up it frees up I can't talk to people I did blow that's why I wanted my fucking room and hid you fucking turn the phone on me think I did that cuz I couldn't talk to people I know what the fuck you talking about isn't coke make you talk though it doesn't work that doesn't want started when it started your Chatty Cathy you want to talk to everybody and shit yeah but let me tell you something I started doing coke like in the 80s and I got on stage in 91 for the first time and in 92 I got on stage with the guys from then right there the st. Patty's Show and right there was the first time I discovered cocaine in the stage I had to bold a broker I did two bumps and tried to go on stage and be cute that shit didn't work I thought Richard pride that I took that's a Richard Pryor that he did coke and wanna say so I tried it that didn't work that was a kaput this is anybody known to do coke and go on to fuck yeah fuck yeah a lot of people do coke instead at Miami I would do the first two shows Oh sober but the third show it takes a bull I had that coke in my pocket before I was enough is enough enough is enough see you do before the Thursday yeah cuz I didn't know it worked because they knew I was coked up so they knew the people who were coked up new and they love to look at me and I thought it was cute too so I went back to my room got fucked up and you know it doesn't never click to me there's a motherfucker and don't wanna stay red man you miss Friday night I know I heard about this you heard Friday night how I fuckin almost had a nervous breakdown when you and your wife were asking me questions and I was fidgety I was having a nervous breakdown right you think I'm fuckin with you guys I don't know Friday night I bombed so hard last week you know sometimes you get a transition pair you got all these bits that aren't ready and you bring them up and it's like you got three of them so you bomb for two weeks but all of a sudden one might be all come together now you become a force now it's a different game I was in that process like two weeks I was in limbo I good sets in Boston but anything I tried out of the ordinary in Boston wasn't clicking for me so I just stuck to the fucking original and then I came back to the Comi straight shit somewhere on Monday night I went to an economy split there is they opened up with that suicide joke that didn't take me very far [Laughter] I told the story about my friend who tried to commit suicide she failed and she wanted to the comedy store and she bought a

I'm gonna say how I bombed it's just whipping me now right and I'm starting to get scared Jevon comes over to me and goes Joey go on stage I walk over as I walk up the stairs it's a sold-out room Megan Mooney Morgan Morgan Murphy's up on stage [Laughter] [Music] she was texting her right now she was fucking kill her right she's killing make a move from whatever fucking name Morgan Murphy brought the dog up she was freaking me out man she's killing on stage I walk up to the first landing guys and it hits me it's like oh my god I'm getting anxiety attack on 70 milligrams not not this can't be happening to me this ain't happening and also I'm standing there and it's getting worse guys it's getting worse now there's one seat open at the whole Comedy Store listen Mitzi's chair so I sit in there for about a minute she's got the blue light on the pressures on I got water in my hand I get back up and it's getting worse guys I turn around I look down to where the payphone used to be and now I'm getting the anxiety I get when I'm getting the needles which means I'm going down so I gotta look for daylight or air I know this I look for air but I know if I go down those stairs if she calls my name and I come back up those stairs I'm really gonna have an anxiety attack so I go to the corner and I just don't look at the wall I start breathing through my nose and some guy comes up to me say hey Joey how you doing man what's going on I go nothing I keep looking at the walking that he gets to have to walk away then some other guy pops out he's like hey Joey I'm French and such and society he goes do you know where he is I don't give a fuck don't you see me staring at a fuck Jeff comes up to me and I know Jeff hold on one second jack I'm gonna faint I got a really bad anxiety attack I'm going down here tell paulie to go onstage and Jeff also wants to ask me questions he's like do you know Paul he's gonna go up on stage I don't give a fuck he's the closest person to the fucking stage she's about to call my name and also he goes well let me go ask him fucking go ask him fuck the fucking fan now you do this to me so he walks over to Paul and he starts asking Paul and Paul he's like and now they're getting for like a conversation about instead of polygons he's got an anxiety attack when they go up there I'm watching this go down I get so angered I go fucking guys on Twitter pose instead of going just if I go up Redbank go up uh go up red band I got a man's ID you go-go cage Oh II I don't worry you later you okay yeah just go no these guys have a conversation bureaucracy I got so fucking angered I go fuck you guys I'm gonna go up and I went up there djaro to set up my life off of fear [Laughter] fucking retard you know you never hear me talk like this yeah all I'm fear walking out of there man I got in that car and Paul he goes man you should have anxiety attacks more often than shit I was bad I was fucking dying I like how you have Mitzi's voice when you do the impression of palsy doom it see like all the shores share one Joey Diaz voice Joe have you ever had that where you were like either to stone or so you just didn't feel good and you're about to go on state he almost couldn't you almost don't think you could have done it no I know you're saying I know I've never gotten there but I don't I don't know I won't take that kind of a ttle bow before I go onstage I've fucked up and gotten too high before I went onstage but never so high where I'm like I can't do this I can't do them have an anxiety attack no but I've been higher I've been hired and that doesn't happen to me sometimes it just catches you the right time especially if you have a rough set if you had a rough set the night before if you're working on some new stuff and doesn't go over right you can't recover I mean we've all been there if you haven't been there it's just because you haven't taken enough chances it's like those moments after that are shaky like you know it's a shaky one or two days you know sometimes sometimes it's not like sometimes it makes sense and there's a reason you could just get right back into it but sometimes there's like a little shaky period so the shaky period that's 70 milligrams was enough to whack you you did to 70s no I did once the once the other 70 was from a couple nights earlier just that for the fucking general public 7 d will fucking send you down a tornado of despair to the bottom Pitts your soul Justin just to know don't try to do what he's doing like I won't I don't fuck around man with anything more than like 30 do you think that that even matters what it is though really that do you think it's that accurate where seventy is even ballpark seventy or maybe he just got something that had six hundred in because it was like the bottom of the barrel well you certainly can you know that bit I do about it about the guys who make that stuff yeah it hasn't gotten any better like sure Colorado they have it down to a science they're doing it in Colorado the way they would make regular cookies like if you buy like some bit you know Nabisco chips a holy or some shit like that they do them like a factory there's not much difference in a way they're making some of these cookies they're having like these big machines and they have all these people working there it's pretty fuckin down to a science they're not just you know throwing their own ingredients in home cooking all this stuff they're making a lot of money they had this like one of those news reports shows forget which one was it sixty one it's they went to Denver and they participated they got high they got high in a fucking limo with these people and they they they went around to all these different places and watch these people make these things that plate that there's a revolution going on in Denver like it's so off the charts there it's so crazy they're so like you're watching this thing on television it just starts to sink in like they're changing the whole culture around that town like the whole culture is gonna slowly chilla their violent crime rate is so low now they're fuckin a drunk-driving rate to the lowest they've ever had it's nuts it's changing everything it's only been a year to like how many years has it been since it's been legal what's the official be through years to is it been to Jamie fight you'll find out when when the law went through but in Oregon they're gonna have lead weed tax free Oregon's taking it to a totally new level well Washington just I just thought read a report that Washington had like I think seventy million dollars their first year of tax revenue so that seems like a lot of money just to that's a lot throw away with you I think the the taxes that the the Colorado imposes which are really high I think those are great I agree because it's still better than going drinking if you go drinking okay if we have a few drinks like if I go and get us us around and all four of us went out drinking and I just kid shots in to be here and that's like a hundred bucks right altogether then you get a tip the guy that like 200 bucks for the weed Jesus Christ we the four of us with 200 bucks for the weed we'd be fucked for a month and we could take home some yeah 200 dollars that's a lot of weed especially if you're buying edibles oh my god you could almost die on $200 worth of weed edibles and if you ate them all what's up getting last year okay so they 2012 voted at the end of 2012 and started at the beginning of 2014 well oh oh I see I see so there's a there's a data delay that is one of the funnest four days you'll have as a comic is that Oh special E if you stayed downtown because you eat at Sam's that motherfucking green chili for breakfast but those two eggs or some wheat toast and a bowl of fruit god oh my god I thought you gonna talk about the crowds no you got the weed store and you got the comedy work I mean it's like a three is that you can't lose for three days I got a gym you cannot lose it's a triple fucking head of the little weed store they got they think a lot of you you want a recreational sign they have yeah it's a great spot it's a great little reason one of my favorite places it's one a few places I would live besides here I'll tell you what you made me laugh because I thought about something red man you know what pill when I was growing up had a lot of mistakes with them what pill like if they made a hundred of them ten of them won't always be judge quaaludes really ten of them were always does well they duds because it was corruption no they were duds because the guy who was making them his his floor was lopsided I don't fucking know he was lopsided you know like right now this for every hundred so you need ten biscuits and nothing would happen and people would go oh my god I got a dud that means the next one's gonna be good that was a philosophy around them but there's a different philosophy to it one of Cosby gave one of those duds to one of his freaks did you see yes he drove in his big black dick waiting on them pills to hit his shit what do you think like he could get laid he could have probably almost any of the girls he wanted to drug anyways probably why did do you think he did that it's Father's film it's part of his for me we could speculate all day long but obviously he's sick right obviously but we kind of knew that anyway not that he was sick to the extent that he is but that he's got is like creepy arrogance about him and you know we played that clip once or Wanda Sykes who's like the sweetest person in the world was interviewing him and and the way she was talking to him I guess like he didn't like it so he like corrected her he corrected her you know her her use of Ebonics or what happy around McQueen kind of just not a nice guy just not a nice guy and he was wearing sunglasses like he's you know and when you're indoors you wearing sunglasses like unless you got glaucoma what the fuck you doing like what he doing why do you have sunglasses on unless you're black you get away with it Floyd Mayweather to wear sunglasses whatever the fuck he wants as far as I'm concerned he can wear sunglasses anywhere he wants but you know it's like those anyone who does that like you know I mean it's just weird because I could see where it look like a normal person would drug it just to get laid it just seems like you know you're built fucking Cosby Lady creep did he like the girl just being passed out like it's dry he likes dry sex or he might he might like to be the guy he might like to be totally in control their life who might like the idea that he tricked them and they now they have to do is bidding while they're completely unconscious I don't know how unconscious they are maybe they're in like a halfway dreamland where he could talk to them and doing stuff you know like lift your legs up and I'll just do it and they just don't remember it they might just be so fucked I don't understand I talked to you gentlemen this four of us in this room were all men here I may use have had an experience I mean maybe fucking read bad huh me is a fan experience oh you brought a woman to your room and nothing happened look me in the eye tell me that's your job it happened okay so if that's that's what let's just switch four gentlemen here let's be honest so we're at 80% if you bring a woman to your hotel room eight out of ten times you're gonna fuck her guys tell me the truth we just guys it depends a nice guy over to get high and they can make you feel but dildos met bosoms I'm talking about you know okay you're a nice guy sometime you know what happens entirely on the individual on the intent when you're a guy like Bill Cosby he's a superstar Multi multi let's be honest not a whole lot of them go into that room whether they're married or the half of those bitches got a different story also okay he drugged you because you were along with him in the fucking room he had plans I'm not blaming them but we're here Jeff were men here we're men you know when you go into a man's hotel room or his trailer you know what the fuck so he had time to put a pill into your thing he's a dirty motherfucker let's get that out of the way because he enjoys that faint woman yeah that woman that's half dead anyway that's what he enjoys that's his freak some people steal bodies from cemeteries some people want to get jerked off with their feet that was his freak I had a friend who was after was doing and he said they would jerk him off with his feet cause he was scared of the him so he just having jerk him off with his feet like at their feet with their feet yeah I'm gonna do that either that's just it's worse hooker feet won't hook a dirty feet country and sperm that shit don't mix but let's face it he he took those women to his room and he Bravo has a real interesting tank yeah real good taking this and there was another guy that got charged for it was like Cee Lo Green guy was giving girls ecstasy or something like that yes grandmas give Molly and Eddie was talking about like what it must be like to be like a really famous guy who's really rich but you're also like maybe not the most attractive guy in the world you know so like maybe some of them they want to get to know you but then when you want them to like be sexually attracted to you it doesn't happen and so if you're a creep you start drugging them and and that's what what Eddie was proposing he was saying like maybe like he just got tired of them saying no and he thought he was better than them and just dropped it in I forget exactly the Eddie's words but I hadn't considered it like that I hadn't thought about it like that like maybe maybe they're not all saying yes I mean maybe it is what a weird thing with them where it got like really frustrating and then he just decided to do it or is it possible that maybe this was like a much more prevalent and accepted thing in the circles that he was running in in like the 1960s is it possible that people like you talk about people giving people a Mickey or he did a joke about Spanish Fly and that Spanish Fly joke is it possible that more people were doing this back then and we're just finding out about it now I don't know cuz I mean he's slipping the Mickey thing was totally I mean and the Spanish Fly thing was almost common like people talked about almost like I look on The Tonight Show I think they'll cause be talked about like and then you know and it seemed like it was more accepted but just it was it they weren't aware was it like but I don't know anybody who got like in the 60s or 70s who got a Mickey slipped into them it's like why was that such a common expression Charles Bronson never did it James Coburn never did it Steve McQueen never did it fucking Burt Reynolds never did it can you uh do me a favor can you get me the beginning of the longest yard I want to show Joe Rogan how much times have changed you know what it is it's really dark there's something real of dark about it like you can imagine like what is his just what is what's what's going on what is his essence you know what is his soul he's doing that freak with Luffy that made it look sexy back in the day like a James Bond the cool I got some Spanish Fly it's it seems like I remember the result and you know what there was a movie though Animal House where he had to decide whether or not to do the right thing or the wrong thing remember the black yes with the devil with on his shoulders yes the angel was saying hey you know she's blacked out a devil's like fucker suck her tits fucker and and you know he couldn't figure out what to do like you could you probably couldn't even do that movie today should not creeper well that's a joke you can't mean it's one thing if this was uh you can obviously have a horrific rape scene if it's like a drama right but if it's it's a comedy and you're joking around about right you can't have that we no one will accept that that's the last rape scene that made you uncomfortable it worries with movies there's always rape scenes that make you uncomfortable but what I'm saying is that you couldn't have a joke about potentially raping a girl like Animal House like you could have a you could have a horrible scene in a realistic show but we're the Devils on your shoulder at a comedy going fucker fucker like whoa like that's uh I don't think you could do that today well watch this for a second Jamie did you find it's in there it's in that opening scene from the original Longest Yard said watch this you're gonna die you're gonna say they could not do this in a fucking movie if it's happened off yeah lettuce skin it off this is the original lock original Longest Yard the first thing no long as yarn is so fucking off-color that it could not be done today I would we just watched it by mistake one day and were like oh God that's fucking bad really I never listen I ran in little circles I'm gonna look you guys in the face I never heard of people spike in girls that would not be acceptable why I came from that would not be fucking acceptable don't get me wrong I've gotten shift coked up to the gills to suck my dick but they're awakeness and I had detention you know I'm saying go back the next day but they did the blow you do the devil you got a drink the side this is just crank it this is terrible movie watch this dude this is so this is 1973 I can't believe how bad it is this is drinking that's what people did back there are you fucking kidding me are you fucking kidding me chewing gum smiling chewing gum walk drinking what kind of shit box is he driving though back to LA Zarate in 1973 that's what a Maserati looks like she just said don't touch my Mars ride that's hilarious isn't that funny that that could be like a cool car and the cops are now coming after him while he's drinking he throws in the backseat oh my god of his life just he's outrunning the cops with his Maserati here this is hilarious then a go-kart race a car that's your dad had that I think so I think yeah all those giant big goofy American cars chasing it these cars handle so bad I think I damn good chasing this is so ridiculous well-timed Jesus grace god damn boom price it caught the car chase listen guys the car chases in those days was so tough when you see that movie with McQueen and they chase them in San Francisco and Mustang oh you're fucking that that was so much tougher to drive that car oh yeah that shit now today it's easy this is when you add it be a fucking monster yeah these cars are dog shit like look how skinny as tires are you see how skinny those tires are there's like no traction on those fucking things that the mechanical grip is nothing this guy oh my goodness this bad motherfucker tearing shit up in this country this is before a cannibal run right yeah this is when he was still I'm like how savage I got the trunk magically closed watch this nah I still listen the same song he did he hit rewind this 8-track look at the cigarettes he smokes to a fries this was him okay this is a different America this was him against Clint Eastwood against Charles Bronson against James Coburn you had to do this crazy type shit smack because he doesn't want them to catch him don't you understand Brian but how did he put the gas back down the coast cars with dog shit you could just fuck you water forward button then he goes to the carwash he goes to the bar and the cops come and he's sitting there fucking Hamid and then I step away from the bar and the little guy goes why did you throw a whole car in the ocean Jamie put on the the chase scene from Bullitt I watched Bullitt this year I was up in Canada and it was on TV you got to sit there though so the fuck were they thinking I watched it from the beginning to the end it was great wonderful Steve McQueen top movie in San Francisco and they have a crazy scene with a 68 Mustang where McQueen is chasing this guy this guy's chasing him and a Dodge Charger oh it's one of the all-time great car scenes look at this shit the guy's got this gigantic Dodge Charger and he's got this dope 68 Mustang which four cars back then handled really got damn good I mean that was a lightweight car with a good amount of power but you know their drum brakes and shitty suspension and so these guys are driving around the corners it's when you were stopped man now there's guys in the hospital fucked eight pitches and shit that's when you fucking were a stunt man then it had ads on that you did it with Wranglers on how much a Steve McQueen's own driving did he do I don't know how much in the movie because he's obviously doing some of it he could drive his ass home yeah he could drive his ass home he used to bring the movie plate yes what was the mom LeMans he plays I'm a great movie I forgot all about that time for a movie yeah love and it's another movie that there for like 10 minutes nobody says a word that's the the thing about this chase scene one of the craziest things about it is how well orchestrated it is how cool it is look at skinny-ass bitch the world and just would not work today people walk out of this movie they would have no meaning not me but today the attention span for a big time movie for sure people are used to these smash cuts and they're used to MTV style editing you know I have music videos like the champions of like quick editing at Eddie Bravo again explained that to me he was talking to me about how they make music videos if you notice they're constantly switching angles constantly changing the way it looks because you don't have a static image for like 60 seconds you know someone's standing there he goes that's really rare most the time like especially pop songs they're constantly trying to move the image around to keep you interested in it but this movie look we're watching this guy load shells new his shotgun for like 20 seconds it's like they set everything up in a different way at the beginning of the mechanics there's not a word for the first 14 minutes he just watches the guy and sets him up same thing you sitting at going what's going on fucking up that dodge charger between this movie and the Dukes of Hazzard more people fucked up Dodge Chargers hurts my soul I watch The Dukes of Hazzard and watch that fucking car make a jump and watch the frame Bend and then they just drive away just and you know that the car that they jumped with is not the car they're driving with they put a kid on it correct well you know they just got a bunch of them and they just broke a bunch of them and they but they did have some fake ones too like some other cars with like a charger body shell that there was sacrifice Miami Vice all those cars were just kids yeah oh for those Ferraris Don Johnson's was a kid Testarossa was it really it was a kid it wasn't a real testa Rossa no kidding Wow I've seen a Miata that somebody turned into a Testarossa no not a Miata I'm sorry a Fiero remember those Fieros Pontiac Fiero yeah my sister had willows my ex-girl the trade-in value on those was ooh God's when you brought his back there like eight hundred people would crack right there like a statue I paid 8,000 that seen the guy loses the car and goes right into the gas station and it blows up oh he almost lost every kick cars almost got a credit card is he still album today I was looking in the back of one of those Hot Rod magazine's and they had this KITT car thing it was like not that much money either for the kit and you you put it together yourself and you have to I think you have to put an engine in it you have to do the whole thing but some people actually do that they actually build their own cars yeah it was my for my first car when I was teen that was when my options it was to get a army kit car we need to build your own yeah get the juice with 250 bucks yeah and put a lot of different frame is something crazy it was advertised like a comic book yeah I think there's a car I think it's called the noble I think it's called but it's a car I think it's from England and they ship it over here it's this beautiful crazy-looking sports car they ship it over here with no engine and you have to get an engine put in it so I can so it's not really I mean it's it's they don't consider it a car when you buy it and that's how they could sell it to you because it's not it's you know it doesn't have all the it doesn't pass all the regulations that you need you don't have to do that is maserati italian car yes dad when they were shipping cars over in the 70s they had to take the engines on this shit so the mafia couldn't steal the cars really yeah they also when they sent Italian shoes over after a while they would just send cargoes or right shoes and then cargoes with left shoes because like that they wouldn't get robbed that's fucking hilarious they would rob the fucking penal of course the fucking docks of the Italian shoes well the docks have always been known has been like one of the places for organized crime right on the waterfront with Marlon Brando my buddy Joe Lake that we were talking about he was a teamster he was a longshoreman and you know a longshoreman like that that whole world has always been like Despres depicted in movies as being like organized crime headquarters they meet down by the docks you know there's always like people like that you know that are like the rough hard tumble hard loan sharks yeah every jacket yeah hey that comes off those four I have a friend till this day I talked to mr. Lee still drives cars off the ships those for a living Wow so the ships come in with like Honda's 42,000 to fucking dollars an hour plus overtime drove since he was in high school oh this is what I was gonna ask you earlier but I didn't want to interrupt your story the reason why do they grow heroin in other countries I don't even know if you know this but they grow it in other countries because they can't grow here or do they grow it in other countries because it's not financially viable the poppy seed well I listen let me tell you something if any drug dealer could grow preceeds here and eliminate the travel they would have done it but would they have what I'm saying what I'm thinking is lutely a nobody who could cut that cost out eliminate that whole fucking journey I don't I'm I think you need a lot of land I think it's one of those things would be really hard to do indoors because I think it's something that they do like when they make heroin you need a lot of land to make a smaller amount of heroin then you would think pop you see this comes from everyone comes from the poppy plant yeah right mm-hmm and I think it's high out it's like coca leaves why don't they grow coca Lucia yeah that's exactly the same question I'll take grow coca Lucia but I heard now that that's a big market now people important coca leaves people in Beverly Hills now having Coco Lee's parties which cigars will you choose those be great and you smoke a cigar and drink wine and people get fucked up that's the rumor like 300 a leaf I know what the deal is I've never eaten no fucking leaves I would the people in the high-altitude ow Peru they have bags these things they take with them it's really kind of freaky to watch they pack their mouths with it and they they have like a squirrel size lump on the side of their face and they just chew these fucking chewing tobacco only coca leaves except it's actually kind of healthy for you yeah it's not bad for that's before you ride the guillotine what was I well there's a fucking new drug did you see this this crocodile yeah it's been a while around for a while what the fuck is this where they take a doc dilaudid they process it to some Mouse they put two drugs in this gasoline and red sofa that should tell you right there that's not the drug for me right or wrong yeah gasoline and then it eats the skin yeah it's causing a necrosis I mean I could get you I think it starts out when they just have like a little bit of you know a bruised area or fucked up area and then they they just get hooked on shooting it in and they keep shooting in that spot it keeps getting worse and worse it's just not getting better and then it starts really going down the hill and then they get super depressed and they keep shooting and in there I think it's a it's a real bad drug real dangerous scary drug and apparently they're doing it when they can't get heroin you know that's that's how a lot of it got started we read online but the images if they're correct if those are real images of people's bones poked down yeah that really is true that's uh that's spookiest fuck look when your bones are exposed you got a problem it's a problem it's a real problem I used to split coke with a guy that while he was talking to you he'd have to get the straw and then look like a paper clip in his nose because the skin had collapsed so we'd have to pick the skin up put the dollar in there and then snort it oh my god and this was nadie five I can't now he's missing his nose like he ain't even breathing oh my god that was an eighty fucking five last time I saw it with that guy they would have to pick up the wall from his nose Jaime find out why they don't grow cocaine in the United States imagine that shit someone on the message board says it takes an acre of coca leaves to make a kilo so that you need like slave labor to collect process uh-huh that doesn't make some sense listen brother they could do it yeah they would have done it trust me target they had the financing they've had the fucking money right and there's something they could have hid it back then no they can't do it is a reason why they can't do it it's about the altitude there's something in the soil is some reason hmm both of those things if not some drug dealer would have hired a chemist and said bring it over here some Chinese guy okay with tons of loot well I got another genius Chinese guy 30 years ago and said teach us how to grow this shit in Jersey yeah that's it it would eliminated everything but there's some reason why you know you just can't they made synthetic heroin yeah but you need that Chinese white shit on this coast they have the Mexican that car that shit you just shoot and you smoke but on the East Coast that's that white powder is what the suburban kids like that's what the models get hooked on because it's two bunks and you're done you're done it's lights out now they're making a pure than ever it's it's you know because it's coming from Afghanistan scum you know this this list next war this last war this started after 9/11 just picked up heroin yeah it started coming in here again especially in the Detroit area Detroit is not as fucked up as it is because you know it's fucked up it's because they just threw heroin in that I couldn't fucking animal man and the same thing happened in Newark New Jersey had happened a couple fucking areas I know about because I have friends that shoot fucking a helmet and they tell you this in your life hmm that's interesting that this happened after 9/11 Wow so well I mean the the production of heroin has gone through the roof in Afghanistan you know and there's all sorts of reasons why they have excuses why they let them do it or why it's happening or why you know the the army helps them so pills are at their all-time highest and heroines at their all-time highest so where are they making the pills from do they need actual heroin to make those pills or do they need poppy seeds they need something Danai poppies to some of them that's probably something yeah it's probably all synthetic right well what does that mean though like where are they getting the compounds to put it together like what is it what is it where they come from and they have to have like a raw version of something that turns into heroin right I mean when you say synthetic it's not like you press a 3d printer and heroin comes out what no you have to it has to be things that they like a lot of pharmaceuticals we think of them as pharmaceuticals but a lot of them they're actually getting some of the chemicals from plants you know that's one of the reasons why they mined the rainforests they're always looking for different plants that they can exploit and they can make pharmaceutical drugs out of it's kind of like remember when I was a hippie a lot of people had synthetic peyote and I don't know what that even means but I think they just took the the compounds or whatever makes you know real peyote and just recreate it in a lab somehow you know it's like isn't it like ingredients well there was a story that I read about coca-cola because coca-cola uses real coca leaves right real coke still today still today these are real coca leaves and they don't have cocaine him anymore what they do is they get these coca leaves and they bring them to this medical cocaine supplying that's right and they take the coke out sell that to New Jersey exactly company New Jersey and they split into medicine you're right so that's all coming from coca leaves which is really crazy like you wouldn't have thought that you would have thought that like synthetic cocaine or lidocaine or whatever the fuck it is they're using which whatever versions of medical-grade cocaine they use you'd have thought somehow or another that's coming from kamek that's we would think it's synthetic we always like to say shit like that but what does that mean like there's got to be like raw compounds that are used to make this stuff where are those coming from it's coming from the origin I think synthetic means they take some of the origin and they put other shit in it to match and they make it cheap before you you know it's like when you go to the store now and you go hi I'm here to pick up my medication they go well we haven't wanted to ask you a question Jenny want the original oxycontin or do you want Mela cotton which is the same only made in Switzerland but instead of $80 the prescription is $28 right so I shouldn't say synthetic heroin synthetic opiates where do synthetic opiates come from derived from opium well there's a bunch that are derived from opium wow that's a fucking nutty list morphine codeine heroin tea Bane and or hevene huh I didn't know codeine heroin heroin and morphine how similar they are it's like the same really that's I've heard I mean I don't use them obviously but I've heard that's true that I've done Aaron I was like a cousin the fucking I was on a morphine drip right when I go oh yeah he operated on my first time it was amazing oh my god I kept hitting that button he hit the button whenever you want this is like 1993 they didn't regulate you since I was lying in this bed my knee was killing me and I hit that button and just it would be like nyquil like taking a night glow like clip-clip that's probably what heroin it's like mm-hmm it's pretty sweet let's do it so I've done it so there you go I've done heroin I didn't even think I did but then I remembered that uh that one night that I had to stay in the hospital and I had my ACL reconstructed that's why they they had me there and it was done with the patellar tendon graft that's how they did it back then that was a good way to do it sometimes they still do it that way today they're taking a chunk of bone off my knee and a chunk of bone off my shin and a sliver of my patellar tendon and then they open you up like a fish screw this piece of meat use the bone piece that they cut out of the shin and the bone piece that they cut out of the kneecap and then they reconstruct a knee and it hurts like a motherfucker dude whoo it's like like like lightning bolts shooting when you whenever you cut into bone and drills like it's the what the other one that I had done I had done with a cadaver like way easier I mean I mean like almost nothing like I went to you know Matt Lichtenberg I went to his birthday party five days after the operation just walked what's fine like it you know I had a brace on it I didn't want to hurt myself but I didn't need crutches I could get around like it's totally different than the patellar tendon graft your leg blows up like a fucking balloon but I'm lying in bed and they have me on this continuous motion machine from the moment you come out of the operating room they put you on a do what they don't want your leg to stiffen up because it's really hard to get it to get moving again you know once you once you get really rigid you know the trauma sets in and it's really difficult to straighten your leg out so right away they have you on this thing that's like wrong so not only you in agony but your leg is on this continuum machine wrong wrong more morphine is commonly related to is morphine sulfate heroin is diacetyl morphine that is heroin is simply morphine with an acetal molecule attached ass it'll settle little more molecule attached so it's basically same shit yeah and that molecule just is that so it does it faster yeah in terms of the effects they're exactly the same and medically interchangeable except for the dosage in fact they're both converted to the same form of morphine when they get into the body fascinating thank you young it's all of us you know when you had surgery I thought I'm gonna make give me this give me your heroin it's not amazing get me a CH you know a different form it's not the street level but it's a form of what you're getting I've it's tremendous who doesn't like that huh uh-huh my friend's mom cancer and you know she went through all the channels and she was on her way out and she decided to go out on her own by taking all morphine just said look what a beautiful way to do it just do it like this just took it all you know they were giving her something for pain I guess you know she had enough too to stop the ticker it's enough it's like I'm wasting away shoes there's no hope like it's over like her body's it was over it was like the last few days but that's how she decided to do it you got to respect that you know like the fact that that's illegal you know I know it would be abused I know it could be abused by people that want to kill people you know my mom wanted to go you know the you could you could run into those type of people that would actually kill family member to get some money from the will kill a wife you know those those kind of things but I think that still for someone who's dying man for your mom or something like that when it's the last days and you got to watch her just in agony constantly with no light at the end of the tunnel you know she's 90 years old or whatever the hell she is like fuck man like you've got to have a heart man that shit should be legal you should should be able to do that in some places it is right it's legal in Oregon like there was that one girl that was trying to do that she did Oregon did she do it yes she ended up delaying it a couple days and then she and she did it yeah oh that's crazy shit man I think you gotta be there to really make a decision on that one you know yeah it's tough to just some people get tired of fighting you know you're tired you get weary from the illness just draining you and then the chemotherapy drains you sometimes even further it's hard you know the last days what's amazing is how many people benefit from CBDs from marijuana and how few people are getting it you know the more I read about this and the more I talk to people that have had it and talked to people that have loved ones that have tried it on cancer and had incredible results commit just drives me nuts it's just so hard to believe that that stuff still demonized that people are still pretending that's one of the worst things that society can make legal where for just if it only did that with cancer forget about the getting high part if it only did that for cancer do you know how magical that drug would be it's like it's it's got this creepy past it's like a stripper that wrote the most amazing book but nobody wants to listen to it because she used to be a stripper like it's got like marijuana has this like seedy part to it and that CD part keeps people from recognizing the the textile use the uses as a commodity the use for making houses the use for food like if it was just all those things and didn't get people high it would be our all-time favorite plant it would be the number one plant in the world we would be using it all the time they say that this hempcrete have you ever heard of hempcrete concrete they make with hemp it's supposed to be like well some of the most durable lightweight fire resistant insulation it's it's it's it's great insulated properties insulation properties and it's made out of hemp and you can make it cheap you know it doesn't doesn't cost a lot of money to grow hemp they just can't grow it like and you can't even get high from this shit I mean it's really crazy if you stopped and thought about it if it was a plot in a movie if there was something that was as powerful as the marijuana plant it was something that had so many benefits and it was somehow another kept illegal and somehow none of the propaganda kept people thinking that it would be one of the worst things for society if they were to make this legal you would lose your fucking mind you would you would go this movie stupid like this movies dumb people would riot they wouldn't do it and come on you got something that cures epilepsy in kids little kids that have epilepsy have you seen any different fucking kids have benefited Johnny Rotten yeah our buddy Johnny his kid was having all sorts of seizures he moves up to Seattle gets him on the medical marijuana program boom goes away goes away gets the hundred times better and the kid starts communicating changed his life change that kid's life fuck man it's just weird it's one of the weirdest parts about being alive in 2015 so there's so many improvements going on there's so much fascinating shit happening in our culture and yet this one thing is like this hold out this clawing thing that clings to the sod so it's not that it's the people's reaction that gets me still hmm like I'm the type of guy that you know what man I didn't eat sushi till 1995 but I came around you know when I was in New York fuck you were raw fish I'm saying raw fish you know what the fuck but then one day I came around I never said I hated sushi I just said it wasn't for me at the time and you listen to a fucking moron like Governor Christie who just aggravates me and aggravates me that this guy is running for president this fucking year's president fucking list is horrible thank God I'm happy I got felonies yike these motherfuckers from the Cuban dude to Christie wouldn't bad shape these ridiculous as a bad show he's a ridiculous ridiculous person he's so ridiculous oh my god I cannot fine I'm so happy I don't live in Jersey man I'm so fucking happy but you know what he's so mocked just I can't imagine him ever and he's got that whole bridge things gonna hold him back he's not gonna get enough but what he will do in doing this is raise his public profile and maybe he's pretty good at debating he's pretty good at talking and maybe if he has these conversations in front of America you know the way he's been having them in New Jersey maybe like in a big public forum like presidential debates it could be kind of interesting it could be interesting to hear him talk cuz he as moronic as he is he's still a very good talker you know he gets I disagree with a lot of the shit that he says but I gotta respect the fact that the guy knows how to communicate even sometimes that's all you need in this goofy ass world somebody writes you a good juicy script you have a bunch of people behind you they give you a little makeover they tried to do that with them they got him on that fucking belly band but somehow or another it didn't work like he's still big right I mean he did get on that right yeah find out if he did that cuz that's ridiculous it's the way I look at it I grew up in northern New Jersey I grew up in politicians homes and I know that to be a politician in New Jersey somewhere along the line and when you're running for president it's pretty tough to take an envelope and people have to fuck him raise their hand mm-hmm it's like Donald Trump when he raised his hand I cannot believe it yeah just on what he did in New York in the eighties you know in fact I even moved what did he do in New York in New York in the eighties when he was building all those things hold on sir when we do once the rants start going don't pull it up when he when when in the 80s when he was doing all that developing okay he shut out like Rogan construction okay Rogan construction was started by you I'm just making a name right okay okay he's in construction was a company started by your grandpa no work then his two brothers and then he hired their sons and now they have 12 full-time employees and they've been putzing along since 1948 doing new construction and houses and remodels but whatever they're keeping that lights on right a lot of some of GC comes in was a general contractor on this job who somebody like fucking Trump and he hires people like Rogan construction and search electric and who God's fucking plumbing who God sucked my dick concrete you know fuck the name of the company is someone who make it easier and they would stiff them and all these companies were not a business all that construction he did in New York and New Jersey in the 80s was very suspect number two before he raised his hand I hope I hope that he's this intelligent let me get that water my brother I'm sorry to fuck up your little I hope that he called the congressman or a governor or somebody in Colorado and he said how Barry this Sammy the bull Gravano can he get the TMZ can he get to a farm because all those deals he had going on in the eighties he was in bed with the Mafia it doesn't take a fucking genius to tell you that okay just a try a dumpster the one that Johnny Reed fell in really tried to commit suicide you know those dumpsters you gotta see yeah a square dumpster forget one in Colorado in 1987 was $200 for the day you know what that same dumpster was in New York in 1987 $2,200 that's how high the construction costs were some of it were the Mafia tax well there was a lot of organized crime tons of organized crime so somewhere along the line this Trump was in bed with organized crime had had to be the truffle Aza Atlantic City just look at the locations doesn't it's out of this I always thought of this I always knew this idiot did not could not raise his fucking hand and if anybody is smart going to the Sammy the bull book he talks about in not so many ways really so I guarantee the feds have their files and as soon as this guy moves up a little bit the Sammy the bull told us how can we take care of this a donation to the fucking the buff on bull company or fucking blind kids whatever the fuck it takes because this guy was the major contractor in New York in the 80s all these small businesses he put their lights out you know I know I'll tell you how I know for a fact when I got locked up one of the conditions of me getting out was I had to get a job to alleviate the state of Colorado my attorney came up with this paper listen if you let him out he'll leave not next week not tomorrow we got a plane for him as soon as he gets out of your fucking jail we'll take him out of the gym back to New Jersey but to do all this I have a promise of employment and I called around New Jersey and my friends uncle had a window door trim sash company you know all this shit for your door that's a sash on the bottom by the way and trim around your door and the door and and shades and they sold all that stuff and they have like an 11-man crew like six guys on thongs so he goes who you want to go here he made me they send me the resume of the guys uncle and I called him we spoke on the phone and in fact I wrote the guy while I was in prison back and forth because he would tell me keep your head up you got a job when you get out don't be down on yourself I got out of it into the halfway house I called and I said hey man I gotta sit in a halfway house for 90 days about being Jersey by June he goes I don't think I get high we were working on this construction company and we got stiffed it was that fucking guy Trump we lost everything we had any investment me you know these were high rises you had to pay for all those windows and he's gonna pay you you know they might have got a deposit or something from the GC but not enough that's there and then you sell more just put them under yeah but he would go on to like he would go there he was the top builder and he would go to Joe Rogan construction and he would put it all onto your land so you went down - Wow so he done all this he ruined fucking family businesses and all of a sudden he has this short memory you know when you run for president they look at you in a fucking microscope Michael you know I don't know what happened with the birth certificate no bombs burst of attention but this is some was born in Kenya this is something you cannot overlook with this guy this guy's a prick he doesn't know well he was he was one of the guys that was going on and on about Obama's birth certificate he was like one of the main guys like I first of all uh I don't look just look at them as human beings like when you hear them talk and you you kind of like what they stand for he's my favorite president ever who Obama better than Clinton yeah I think Clinton you know Clinton Lee had a lot of flavor and he did some good stuff too but I think Obama has been the moat maybe it's just the times that we're in he's the most the most noticeable when it comes to like spreading this like what I think is like an improvement and the way people think you know first of all by being black second well by support of gay rights really like blatant support like where they turned the fucking White House rainbow when it got passed and that's crazy shit man that's never existed before when you see when you saw that picture of the White House being rainbow colored at night I was like this is nuts man that wouldn't happen one Nixon this is some shit that's similar to the fucking abolition of slavery it's similar I mean it's not as extreme a slavery it's not as ustream a trap that's so amazing I mean but it's similar in the way that it's gonna change the way people look at gay people it's gonna it might not be now it might not be the generation of our parents it might not be the generation of our older brothers and sisters but it's going to be the generation of our kids the generation of our kids is gonna understand the gay people it's just like being mad at people for having red hair it's just who they are like what do you give a fuck and if you give a fuck about that what else are you gonna come creeping around about what are you gonna fuck with people about what is it you're gonna fuck with people about the way they're dressed you're gonna fuck with people about the way they talk like what is it like leave people to fuck alone and the more we do that the more we could sort it all out and find out what is really bothering us what's really bothering people a lot of what's bothering people is people intruding on other people's lives and it doesn't get any more rusev then in the fucking bedroom you're intruding on people's bedrooms you care if people want to get married if they love each other just because they're two guys or two girls who gives a fuck and if you do give a fuck you're a problem you're a problem in this free world and if this is just one thing that you ideologically attached yourself to and it might be religious based and my who knows what the fuck other shit you got going on your head you don't want people to do you know who knows what other weird kind of Sharia law shit you want to incorporate into society who knows I don't know you think people shouldn't be able to get married just because they're two men or two women that's intolerable in 2015 that's archaic shit and I think that is one of the archaic things that's gonna slowly but surely start vanishing from our world no it's not maybe not now there's still a lot of homophobia now but you know there's this woman from Brazil who's did an interview thing was Jessica and Raj MMA fighter and she was talking about how many people in Brazil are homophobic in comparison to the United States and she's like it's really nice to see the United States doing this and hopefully more people in Brazil think this way too you realize like that a lot of like Latin American countries especially like you were talking about Cuba you were talking me the other night about Cuba Russia yeah yeah yeah you know laws they pass laws against Gabey Bliss's man this is something completely new to some people it doesn't affect me so it doesn't bother me I know like I said it in my joke onstage I lived next to transgenders across the street today the great the gay girl with the dog I talked to him I read a goof on I move on fucking Big Mike and Leslie you know I love him I don't give a fuck you know but there's some people are still living in 19 fucking 70 man yeah and those people are stuck in their own fucking life so I just keep walking yeah you just keep walking what do you guys do and every day they watch The Longest Yard long for the days when it's master chicks face against the wall I was explaining to you the other day that the most foremost community in Cuba is the gay community I grew up with gay Cuba's around me my mom at fucking bar what do you think what keeps the lights on white dudes in the daytime those gay fucks to come in and spend it you know and in those days they were doing blow that was selling blow and I grew up around them I never had any hatred or anything for him but my stepfather he's from the other side of Cuba okay where they can't be in a room with a gay guy no hatred no whatever they just can't be in the room their manhood cannot be in a room with a gay guy you know I and I and I get it some Latin American countries is just but who are the biggest gay guys in the world fucking Latins for the best ones so what do you think that is do you think it's like it's a machine whole thing it's a what what is it like in Sicily on that island what would it be like in 1950 to be gay in Sicily they're banging each other a lot I don't think so I don't fucking think so I think that well that's where the Catholics are but I think that you'd be I think that you would be fucking totally against it right they northern Italy those hard-headed motherfuckers you can't tell those motherfuckers your friend up or whatever the fuck they call them right but that's also where the Vatican is right like how ironic is that that doesn't make any sense because that is the biggest gay sex organization but we don't want to know that it'll be once I know that pedophilia okay the biggest pet of nobody wants to know that do they did priests fuck each other are the only fuck kids how does that work oh no you gotta bring me down with that book now as shit but no this is just curious I didn't I didn't you know I I just know how it was when I was growing up you know the Vatican owned the gates bathhouse no the building the Vatican owned was home to the biggest gay bathhouse in Italy that's crazy yeah should go Karen yeah let me I'll pull up the story because it's fucking ridiculous great game Jamie pull that shit up put it up on the big screen it's ridiculous they don't they mean they're so blatant they've been doing this for so long you know like that this this gigantic crazy cult that's running the Catholic Empire they've been in charge for so long wearing wizard costumes and sitting on Thrones and people so many people have bought into it that is look at this the Vatican pays landlord to Europe's biggest gay bathhouse and by way I say this I went to Catholic school I'm allowed to say this shit shirt threes landlord - they play landlord the herbs biggest gay bathhouse the church paid thirty million dollars to acquire a building that houses a senior Cardinal and a huge gay sauna wait a fucking minute they senior Cardinal and a huge gay sauna that's it that's his own private gay bathhouse the guy owns a bathhouse they paid 30 million first of all how crazy is it that the Vatican has 30 million bucks to buy houses with like they have so much money look at that the

thought last week some dude went in there with a fucked-up hip the guy was de least weekend for fucking psychics rodeo clown Jesus Christ that's the most thankless job it might be one of the most thankless jobs ever nobody gives there's no not one Lance Armstrong or the rodeo clowns you know I mean it's like a 10-block who's like a famous driver right there's like skateboarders Tony Hawk you know there's one guy in each discipline Tiger Woods you know I mean where the everybody knows Tiger Woods a golfer who's the one rodeo clown named one they get no respect there's probably one person that we just don't know it's like a Mexican superhero or something like that they don't really use rodeo clowns they have mean in bullfighting I mean that this that like bull riding I'm pretty sure is an American tradition is it I think so I think in Mexico obviously they have a lot of bullfighting and it's Spain Spain they have a lot of bullfighting I guess that's where they got it from rightly imported from Spain promote because that's what Mexican Mexico is it's like the indigenous Americans that came over when the Spanish came over they they taught them Spanish and started fucking them and that's what made Mexican that's why you get like Mexicans like Oscar De La Hoya you know who's like this beautiful looking you know European looking man like kind of fairly pale skin and then you get a Mexican like you know Juan Manuel Marquez was like much more Mexican looking thank you Inca yeah the darker skin and like the you know darker hair it's interesting man this is the whole North American continent is fucking fascinating it's fascinating to think that if you came to this spot 400 years ago there'd be very few people here very very very few a few nomadic tribes of Native Americans no cities no nothing oh you think how interesting is this there was a diaz on the boat with Columbus and Valdez really yeah that's it the S on the boat with that's where all the Diaz has come from how do you say that and they spell it with a Z and then one of the biggest lieutenants and Sicilian history is a D as with the C and then we just saw that priest with an s ideas with a see a says e Z Z and then you have the fucking lunatics up in Stockton and then Mexican right and I'm sitting here in front of you no Cubans can be right that makes you think like thee as their Diaz their and Diaz as a lieutenant and Diaz was on the ship as an Italian Italian Diaz Italian Diaz an Italian Valdez with a Z my mother side of the family is Valdez and they're darker than bet and my father side is Diaz and let them come away and they came from Spain they speak but that thing yeah a little fill of either Philippe's you know I speak like Jaguars like those people so you have to think how did Diaz get to Mexico how did this Diaz get here and how did Diaz with Izzy the Diaz would've s these are all very interesting things that I look at you look at evolution we were talking about how they found that fuckin tooth of the whale in Wyoming many years ago we had them discussion on the podcast you know this is things that have always baffled me like how come there's Nate Diaz and his brother they're Mexicans it could be not Inca Mexicans though right there the other Mexicans right it came through somewhere else and evolved whatever so it's very interesting you know what's interesting to me one of the things that's been getting me lately is this water situation in California it's pretty bad it's a three years going on for years now and the drought is pretty ferocious like they're they're saying that California used 29 percent less water last month so people are working to try to solve it but was occurring to me when I was thinking about this is we know for a fact that there's areas of the world that used to be lush and then they became desert like that's a that we know the for a fact about the Nile Valley like in Egypt where the pyramids used to be where the boy the pyramids are rather before that like 9,000 years ago they know there was like it was a rainforest there and slowly over time shit just changed and then there's not that much rainfall and that could easily happen in California but would we stay would everybody stay here when they just keep pumping water artificially into the spot or would people go you know what this ain't working the same work you know how many fucking we got to move on like we've always had to all throughout human history whenever the climate got bad people to get the fuck out of there when the Ice Age was happening here no one was living in Canada no one was living in Canada during the Ice Age because it was two miles thick of ice in a lot of spots you wouldn't you weren't you're not living on ice you're right you would find a way to get to a place where it's not ice you know but all the places that were covered in ice were it was a massive amount of Canada so when all that ice receded that's where we got the Great Lakes from the Great Lakes are fucking puddles that are melted glaciers I mean that's how fucking crazy this place was just ten thousand years ago if we had a house and it was there you can't be stubborn when the ice starts coming you can't say we're just gonna keep chipping away at that ice every year I get a certain point in time you got to realize okay there's two miles of ice and it's as big as fucking Canada or half of Canada or even a few states where those few states are you can't live you got to get out of there you got to get out of there and if that happens here we're so arrogant our idea that we can control nature is so arrogant no one considers leaving California like everybody talks about like well California's California we ought to do something about the California water crisis what if it never rains again because guess what that could happen if it doesn't rain but once or twice a year or ten times a year or 20 times a year there have been way crazier things than a shift in our climate to the point where it rains zero that's totally possible it's totally possible if it's possible to rain one day a year it's possible to rain zero if it's possible to rain ten it's possible to rain one it's it could be horrific disastrous it's totally possible and it would be normal it would be something that's happened all throughout the world they know that like a lot of deserts used to be like lush areas and then somehow or another like for whatever reason things changed fainted you know and you can blame people all you want I'm sure we have a lot to do with it I'm sure global warming and that there's without a doubt as some element of human civilization is a part of this too many scientists that believe it does there's got to be some factor but even without that factor it's super possible that shit would change on its own it's it's it's shifts we don't control when it rains it can fucking shift it easily could shift and if you're a spot that sucks you got to make a decision you don't figure out what the fuck you're gonna do it rains more in Phoenix that rains here it rains in Phoenix a lot I don't know that in Ohio and in Houston look at Galveston that's raining so much that that there's shit water everywhere and people are losing their sight because it's overfilled all the sewage and it's that yeah this site yeah this uh this girl lost her sight just from being in the water because they tested the water is it's all shit water view it's in Galveston in Houston they've had such bad flooding the past month it's been horrible horrible oh god I saw some of the photos we worked at the laughs oh stop I was there they were thinking about that Sunday floods it's been that was two months ago no no no the laugh stop I used way back in the yeah west time I remember when they had to close that hotel we used to stand yeah they flooded that thing was a fool it was a time I was there like I'm sorry that this comedy club was on West great I saw a refrigerator going down West it's Tyler fecal matter water advisories oh my god hold on let me read the whole thing fecal matter water advisories issued for some Galveston County beaches fuckin a man shit in the water did a girl really go blind yeah oh that's insane damn the fucking subway already cut ties it Jared okay at least the UFC waited three days you shit with John Jones they let down it these motherfuckers they think Dana's tough fucking subway don't play they don't even give a fuck whether he's guilty or not if even if he if Jarrod didn't do anything but knew about it if he knew the dude had child porn he still responds what are you holding up wow this is the article a woman loses sight in one eye after a mud run a young woman went blind in one eye within 24 hours after catching a flesh-eating bacteria during the mud run in Dallas this month because of all the flooding Oh God it just it says a woman said the de breeze cut her i allowing flesh-eating bacteria to destroy her cornea it just completely melted off my eyes oh my god fuck do we just shit into the ocean how does that work oh shit more than a thousand runners get diarrhea after mud day event of course well you definitely get in some bacteria if you get a mouthful of mud that's a hundred percent you're not supposed to do that by the way you're not supposed to drink still water you know you're lucky if that's all you get you know you can get something way worse than that Gentile shit jumping in a fucking puddle of mud stay home fuck your wife is dropping fucking mud like a jerk-off at least a polar bears jump in the ocean they jump at the fucking cold water and done back in Amity you want to jump in mud after you fucking been running snowing whatever the fuck it's been for a month God knows it's in that fucking mud he's doing those polar bear people were idiots those people that would jump into the water okay you wanted to that freeze it yeah then you said god they're on to something they saw the ocean man it's cold and does something actually when it hits like your bones for a minute when you come out of there you feel like a fucking know man I jumped into the fucking Atlantic is that what we're at which one's cold here here here's called it oh my god when I used to jumping on water in Oregon and Seattle that's fucking low and whether that's freezing that's when you feel the bones in your feet but it's probably really good yep because this cryotherapy shit this stuff is changing my fucking body it's changing the way my body feels it's a see how well it like cures any wick weird shit that's bugging you inflammation back pains like back pains have been fucking with me forever they're just dissolving you just could do it all the time it's your body produces all these anti-inflammation responses to the cold weather so that's probably what they were doing when they were jumping in the ocean you get out of it your body's like just fucking charge your dick shrinks when it gets hard real fast shrinks to the top side of that motherfucker like yum yum juice is being served and shit I'll never forget you saying any ex-girlfriend kill herself no they should there's a girl on Facebook but I Phi so I'll one night the last time I saw this chick was the night Flutie Doug Flutie drew that touchdown huh this is winter of 83 84 maybe and I saw at a bar though this is this they called the lorry the jack that's all the jack no the jack by ac/dc she's got that Jack she's got the Jack she has something like a disease this chick didn't

everything Jersey yeah and I saw her out man I don't know what the fuck have we started doing blow she was a babysitter for this family Louise Donato the guy was a freak we went over the house I saw my deposit bag from the barn I robbed it we got more blow and we have a hotel room do what pal and she's like guess what color my underwear I don't forget that she's like if you color guess the color mind the world let job take him well I'm like red she's like they green but fuck it take them off and I saw her on Facebook and I'm like do you remember what happened that night she's like no I know you don't want to fucking know you wouldn't be here right now it'd be fucking killing yourself that's disgusting all this shit's disgust disgust you know with all this transgender talk I was telling these motherfuckers on stage denied that that chick showed us a pussy in Las Vegas was a transgender do you know what you called it what do they call it it looks like a bat was tight it looked like somebody put a bore in it where the dick hole was and cleaning on that do you remember when Doug and I were doing the man show and we had that really beautiful Trent we had two of them that were really beautiful they were transgender remember the one of them that was pre-op and she she showed his dick to the or her dick rather to the audience she showed his dick that's what I just said but it's hard to say her dick you know I'm saying I was treating her correctly by calling her a she and I got to the dick I'm like she she showed his dick but she was beautiful so beautiful that she was walking up the hill or driving up the hill you know by the used to be the Hyatt next to the comics right she was driving up that hill and Eddie Bravo and I were coming down the hill we were walking and she was coming up and Eddie looked it was god damn like and I go oh that's my friend I go she used to be a dude and he goes you know are you sure you fucking with me you're fucking with me I go no no she's definitely used to be a dude and then you know she said hi and I said I would sup how you doing everything good but boy we talked and then we went down there Eddie goes oh my god I can't believe that used to be a guy I can't believe it he was now I'm so confused now I don't know I thought I would be able to tell I thought tobio deal spot 1 and why you can't spot her she's she's a and she has dick she's as girly as it gets we should pitch that show well get a transgender set like normal guys with the mother day to see if they guess it guys would get violent that's how Jenny Jones got canceled from TV don't remember my house Jenny Jones had an episode where it was like my secret crush and the guy had a secret crush on this this dude that he worked with and the dude that he worked with had no idea what the fuck was going on he was on the show and we're here to tell you that someone has a secret crush on you and the guy gets out it's me thinking that you know he he got out there and he was like really flamboyant and the guy got angry went over his house and shot him yeah fucking killed him and then they just sweat like they pulled the plug we won't do it so doesn't exist anymore check that's already had the operation after they fucking suck then you break it to him like with a guard there with a gun no they did it after the show was over the guy went to his house and killed I know he killed him a couple days later yeah but that's fine listen for life and somebody tells you ain't leaving the house for a week this is what you do you film all the episodes in two days so if they die they die fuck you already made your Vig you got a fucking hundred episodes in the can fuck him he's part gonna kill people that's a no I thought I fucked that you guys who sit him down and go how was your date it was great I've never been with a woman so magical what did we tell you if Diane was really thick the chick then he just could sling dick back in the 80s on the Sunset Strip and the guy just freeze I mean what what could you do like he's gonna kill somebody if it happened to you what would you do that is how good the pussy was the pussy was good fuck it you know he was really a woman is the total here's the total rub okay this is the hundred percent dudes are willing to accept artificially enhanced breasts right no problem I mean some guys don't prefer them but they're willing to accept artificially enhanced breasts so breasts that change your body and they turn your body into something that's more more womanly or more for whatever reason that it activates that part of your lizard brain that sees the big fleshy tits and thinks that this this girl be able to take care of my babies well she's very fertile these are good genes that's the same gene that gives you the big ass like the big ass the big tits like that sparks there's like a flame it's not as a matter of someone giving you affection it's a matter of someone giving you a fiction in a very specific shape that that rings in your brain well if they can do that and do that absolutely perfectly and they will be able to eventually if they can't already right now and turn a guy into the exact shape of a woman that's hot as fuck at the end of the day you can search around for some fucking hidden crackerjack toy you can lift her up and look around and try to figure out okay I don't I guess is this a woman I just looks exactly like a woman it feels like a woman it talks like a woman god damn it is a woman and you'll eventually decide that it's a woman because your brain processes that as female your brain processes the words is female the shape is female and if someone can figure out how to do it just perfectly just perfectly genetically they figured out to go in there and fucking tweak this shit they're close to doing crazy shit like that you saw that thing that Rhonda Patrick tweeted that I retweeted with about the pigs look what they're doing the pigs man they figured out a way to delete a gene in pigs and they come out like Incredible Hulk pigs she she put up a photo of it today they're doing all kinds of weird shit with genetics and they're already doing this on people she says in China she's coming on the podcast soon to talk to me about it I can't wait to talk about it but look at these fucking pigs man this is crazy they're Hulk pigs look at the ass on that pig it's like a bull hi if you were in a pig butt but you me and I'm saying like this is a this is a new thing they're they're doing to the bodies of these animals they're gonna be able to do that to people too man and they're gonna be able to turn a man into a woman like perfectly they'll be able to literally get in there and dig around switch this turn that off and turn this on and wait you're a woman I mean it's gonna happen it's just a matter of time we don't know if they're gonna be able to turn a dick into a vagina without surgery but I kind of imagine one day they will one day they'll just be able to you could go back and forth there's an app for it one day it's the government will have a switch we'll just decide it - today we're gonna be a girl day today everyone is gonna learn to be more sensitive to women because we're all gonna be women and just hit a switch whoa the entire city is a woman and then that's when the Mongols invade come over the hill and I fuck everyone including all the alpha males they just get fucked like chicks and here's a secret they like it they like it cuz their chicks now Joe do you have I take pussy today yeah today I do he's got a replenishment I got a new shot at the doctor I went to the dentist he cleaned my teeth and made my pussy tighter able to do that at home with your own printer you print it artificial vagina they just like wake tighter you're gonna hit the right Keys Apple one click you know and your vagina just going you're gonna have chips in your body that tell your body what to do that's 100 percent there's gonna be artificial blood that's 100 percent nanobots those little they're devising these tiny little itsy-bitsy blood cell sized machines this is what they're gonna eventually have someday that'll fight cancer so if you have like a cancerous growth in your body they'll be able to send these machines through your bloodstream to attack these sick areas of your body I mean we're gonna see some fucking nutty shit in our day and a man turning it to a woman is like the least of the nutty shit if we could stay alive we could all in this room stay alive to 100 what kind of see some shit well he hasn't cut his dick off yet so why is everybody jumping up and down for well because he is allowed to keep his penis and still be a woman Joe you know no he's taking pictures everybody's jumping up and down he still hasn't gone to the farm yeah when she going to farm and cut that motherfucker off then you come see uncle Joey it's a true story until then once you go to the farm then come back and say he hasn't gone yet this is a trick by the wife this is a trick this is a fucking trick ratings something's going on so I'm not sure he got his face fixed all right not like this like he went through feminization surgery where they like shortened his jaw and change his lips and the whole deal have you seen the recent photos look at that's great van across the street Big Mike he hasn't changed his jollies off this suckin dick two nights a week here pussy in there no Big Mike is under construction still I don't really think it's the way he's got a bald spot he's a wig over it his roommate Leslie did everything she got the cheeks to face so she was a man yes okay see this is Lou these photos like look at the these photos like her close up ones of the face like right there like he had a shitload of things done they seemed like a high maintenance guy oh yeah he's crazy as fuck well here's the thing man you know when we were when we were watching that interview when he got interviewed by what was it Diane Sawyer's oh no it wasn't interviewed him what he was loving all the attention he was loving it he was loving the opportunity to talk about himself and talk about having that hold up that pulled that image up Jesus Christmas I loved I was trying to hide those giant canoe feet yeah fuck out of here with those size 38 flippers got an upskirt thing goes I'm fuckin Munich feet let motherfucker jumped in me with a can shit look at it's just it's very strange man I mean that that is a very feminine looking man or woman Joey you want to transition I should say you know I mean in transition she very feminine looking like well if they've done their face but if she really looked like that so this is the thing when you're looking at something like this this has been through more fucking computers I mean more screens and filters and we all know that we all know about the difference between what someone would look like in real life and someone look like in like a super well-done photograph like that it's a big difference but a man good for her if that's what she wants to do now same thing we were talking about before about gay marriage good for her if this is what she enjoys I'm glad that she can be on the cover of a magazine and it could be a fun time for everybody you know when we were kids this could have never happened no never it's weird right and it did happen when we were kids it happened because I watched the report of one that happened and happened in another country and who we just didn't know about it happened like in Germany or somewhere really somebody like in 1914 some American did it we just there was no internet right so we weren't very hip to it you know when I was in Seattle a young comic we hadn't read it rina had done the operation rena was a japanese man that became a japanese woman but then she died because first of all she had a lot of psychological problems that came after the surgery I loved we know we don't let me fall in laughs my first fucking head shine ever forgot that man I paid it back and everything Rita died because her head was too fucking big from being a man what so her balance was off after the surgery I become it's like a Brad becomes a woman his head's gonna be fucking ginormous and his balance is gonna be off from time to time something happens I did the surgery to him to her that her balance got taken off she died because she suffered a fall on a disco and bang the head Rita Oh was an open mic comic I used to run with us in Seattle and she'd come out she had the nails I mean nobody's gonna fuck Rita Oh trust me nobody ever thought of fucking Rita huh her hands were fucking horrid it looked like Herman Munster hands she the nails and she would get nachos and then she'd go to get a drink and we'd take her nachos and she'd yell she had a very feminine voice like yes darling but she looking his getting matches she'll put him down it was fucking scary make mommy the government or the doctors gave her a certain amount of market share became a pill addict because the pains and the surgery plus all the psychological and everything like she you know she she was raised in like the for you know when I met Rita in 95 read it was fifty already you know I'm saying so I was twenty something maybe thirty so she was telling me that when she was growing up a mother and father would beat her when she would tell him that she was really a woman Wow like it was just too much abuse in her life and then once she finally became a woman there was so much baggage you know I mean I'm doing blow with her like I'm talking to all I got the comedy club and her telling me you know as creepy as it was that you know she was she would have to go see a shrink three times a week still what was what was the big did she talk about what the big issue was the transition was a transition transition where she got the money from I know she sold drugs she even came down here to see me once when I was no I had the Comedy Store in 99 and she died shortly after that she fell off the stage I want don't calm and die and we're joking around it was true her head was too big there's a lot anything it had to do with her pills fact she's taking pills is listing more likely in my life it may be maybe two or three transgenders man you know like on the streets when I was a kid in New York City or something and something was always missing you know I'm saying even actually did the surgery something is always not right you're open they just did something major major it's a it's a major step we're just rolling around with these fucking idiots and they never start throwing it around like a tattoo that's the part of it that I don't like that now every time somebody feels feminine they're gonna want to have this fucking surgery you know I'm saying like one day you feel confused or whatever you know this is the martyr but I don't like I get all this gender stuff and I get it man that you're a woman that you were born feeling this but in today's society we got too many sheep that too many weak souls out there dog hmm you know they still argue about you know it's not good and those are the people I'm worried about mmm those people that you know you ever go somewhere you hear people talking you know who's there just to try to be there it's like I'll never forget this I went through a restaurant what's the Santa Monica and there was a guy behind me I was eating I said nobody is this gay nobody could be this gay this guy was not more like this this for this guy is something that he does to be accepted he doesn't even know what he's doing in six years he won't be gaining and six years you'll have a wife and a kid living in Idaho I'll be a farmer but he's just doing this to fit in this is like really I have a lot of that I feel a lot of that with people today in our society a lot I feel people are not completely in there's some people for there's not people in there not in that's why I tell people before you go in there fuck and think it over whether it's hanging out with devil worshipers fuck you wanna do cuz once you're in you're in you're gonna end up kidnapping somebody with a machine gun don't tell me what the fuck I know I know when somebody's faking the funk uh-huh there's people that in them woman when I was a kid Jimmy Bolzano was my brother I knew he was gay I knew he was swinging dick but it took no fucking genius to tell you that my brother I grew up in his house with his other three brothers you couldn't tell he was gay if he came to me today and I'm a transgender I would hug him and go dogs it's great great I can tell you where dick suck I didn't have no doubts in my heart that you weren't gonna suck dick even though you were

gentlemen you're fucking high how many minutes shower can I take who fucking shuts down the golf course and when's that happen because until then fuck yourself cuz they're using millions of gallons of water until you shutting down the golf course fuck off that's that's a hundred percent for entertainment a hundred hundred percent he's at least taking a convert or EF eart of entertainment and a

cuz it's still strong but it just gets sore after I use in there's apparently some bone chips in there from jujitsu flares but what americanus no malik right knee hurts again the one i just has you should you should look into that regina king shit what's with Jenna came with Jenna keys are the blood spinning procedure they take your blood outs with a Kobe Bryant all these guys used to go to Germany for now they have a place in Santa Monica and it just massive wasn't what the other takes out they take out some blood that's when we have a problem got it - whatever - biz you got it - no they got a few - no we can never make two of still they're taking two big tubes and a couple small - there's a bass drum a hair fuck compressor and they fucking banged on honey and blood fuck you that's why I didn't go to the thing the Salvation Army 16 ounces of blood under your blood they're gonna go you know what I try to give blood once a month blood smells like weed I go to a doctor with some fake fucking excuse because people that's why women don't get heart attacks cuz they bleed once a month what they change up their fucking blood but we don't believe like women blood so is in your body rejuvenates new fucking blood even if it's for fuck announcer dealing with is how it's true then doozy did coke would bleed more other noses so they would probably live longer taxes matters because they don't bleed out the fucking monkey I think the reason why they probably don't die as much because they don't say this many women if you're over 40 go give blood once a month just a couple tubes so your body starts from scratch I'm telling you Joe I think when women are not dating women it saves a lot of stress it's good point and I think this gay marriage thing you're gonna see I rise

row and just wasn't it wasn't click click and then boom you you hit on it and figure out what a fucking what it was and it almost like you released something like you had like a demon inside you pulled it out and you have released it and then also you were crushing I remember I think it was Tripoli and I were in the back by the the back hallway and it was like one of the times where you just really started crushing and Tripoli was like Joey Diaz is on another level I go yeah man like what the fuck like you just caught it you like you caught a wave and all of a sudden you were surfing and then from then on you figured it out it was crazy like you went from being like a really funny guy off stage and an occasionally funny guy on stage but often mediocre to a monster just monster like there was Knights in the oor were you would destroy and we were falling out of the back stick we would leave like laughing so hard we would go down the back stairs out into the hallway and it'd be
