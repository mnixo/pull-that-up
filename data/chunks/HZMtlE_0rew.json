the general can experience last night's set was particularly rich an idea to some of the new things that I've been working on are there's a lot of stuff that I'm working on about the sort of weirdness of progressive thought leading like this really aggressive progressiveness that's going on where people are denying reality and they're doing it so because they feel like people have been marginalized in the past which is true but it doesn't mean you spring it back the other way you say a bunch of stupid shit it doesn't make any sense yeah oh you judge people harshly for judging people harshly it's like yeah how does that work try the rock making people for hit it exactly exactly some of the most aggressive people I know are liberals it's really shiny good good I mean there's an amazing video of University of Toronto of this guy who is speaking about men's rights waterfowl and these feminists are protesting these students screaming in their face these students that want to go see this man talk about women's of about men's rights and about that you hate women and all this and they're incredibly aggressive the only hate I see is in the protesters the only hate not that we've been by the way incredibly ignorant to what this guy's actual words are and they weren't even aware they didn't even bother doing the research they didn't even bother formulating a true opinion on these this guy's ideas they just decided that this guy hates women and that's a weird thing I've made some posts about feminism on online before and one of the things that I found incredibly strange is that I got called an MRA asshole so I go what does that mean was the MRA so that I have a sense of I think we got our afraid III didn't know what it meant at all it's men's rights advocate or a most yeah we're happy I was like weed on a minute a feminist a person who wants equal rights for women is saying that being a man who wants equal rights for men is an idiot or I could call the dodo an MRA oh Jesus Christ like well they're the compressed Socratic arguments alright I call it mr a asshole right oh no I didn't even know what an MRI I mean I'm not immense rights advocate I'm any by any stretch of the imagination I don't any blogs I don't visit any forums but I'm a believer in equality as far as like the laws and regulations as they apply to human beings and I do not believe that the laws and regulations as they apply to human beings this country aren't even for men as they are provide and women I don't think they're even for women and I don't think they're even for men yeah if it works what laws are fucking horrendous for men and some of them are atrocious some of them in Canada are god-awful yeah Dave Foley for the longest time I don't know if he's resolved anybody who's listening to this just googled a Foley Joe artists experienced divorce and there's a there's a youtube video that someone compiled of just him talking about divorce it will make your head spin and back to TV yes because what he lost ten million dollars in his last divorce yeah yeah yeah because he said it's not alimony it's all your money that's it is it it's insane it's insane and that's not fair it's not fair I don't care what anybody says I I think that absolutely if a man and woman get divorced and Manship in child support absolutely and if the woman was not working during the time of the marriage I think there should be some sort of compensation something fair and something reasonably has some of the assets that he developed by focusing on whatever yeah sure absolutely but there's internal payments that's just not right yeah it's not it's not right and I have a friend who has to pay his ex-wife they were they were married for 12 years he has to pay her for the rest of her life until she gets married so she plays this game she has a boyfriend and the boyfriend lives with her and he sends the investigators over to figure it out the boyfriends not there and then he leaves and the investigators leave and the boyfriend moves back in and so he has to continue penny like like she's cohabitating with a man and he still has to continue to send her money and it's just a manipulation of the legal system and this guy is paid her millions and millions and millions of dollars she's in his for million dollar Pacific Palisades home I mean it crippled him financially and on top of that he had a pay for her lawyer why they went to Thompson divorce and here's where it gets really crazy she went to every lawyer in town and to salted with them every good lawyer in town that she knew of so that he could never use them as counseled oh because they have a conflict of interest at night what sadness I mean she planned it out she planned this divorce out for a long time was incredibly calculating and the idea that men don't deserve rights and because of the fact that women have been marginalized which is true they have been but that doesn't mean then that haven't been either I mean human beings deserve to be treated fairly that's just true to you you deserve everyone deserves to be treated humanely I don't believe men are I don't believe women are I don't believe humans are but the idea that you could separate and be a feminist but the anti men's rights well you're a fucking crazy person then you know you're not a humanist you're not a person who's looking at all human beings with your brothers and sisters you're a person with an agenda you're a person with an ideology and that ideology is that you're a team you're on Team vagina and everything that's on teeny penis can go fuck itself and that was the that was the the feedback the blowback that I got for a joke about male feminists ya know I'm gonna have to stepped on that landmine a couple of times and I've keep going back to it because it is it is an important one you know men in the legal system I mean not just been divorced but I mean the sentencing disparities between men and women what they call the pussy pass yeah you know I mean it's it's horrendous I mean you called feminism Marxist with Penny's socialism with tits but that was a bad character in one of my novels but now I just thought that feminism is or socialism with panties and it's very true because I mean and then people call oh my god that's so terrible if I just went through all the pounding matriarchs of the feminist system that all Marxists all leftists and so on and also in feminists are so Pro woman then where are they with Margaret Thatcher Margaret Thatcher was like the first leader of a Western country she struggled up from nothing I made an incredibly powerful woman but she was on the right you see so they hate her what about Iran Iran wrote the most influential book outside the Bible and the second most influential book and according to the New York Times review of books after the Bible you know reshaped Western philosophy in many ways in Western politics and the feminist favorite wife is she was on the right at least that's what they think she was not actually on the right but so I mean I have these sort of suspicions when they're sort of is it the leftist ideology or the Pro woman now if it's the problem and then they should be incredibly positive where are the feminists when people insult people like Ann Coulter where are the feminists when people insult Sarah Palin you know like Bill Maher called her a cunt I mean that's really pretty vicious like publicly openly right I mean where are the thing because they're on the right and culture and they're considered be on the right so they get a pass when people go you know but you then you say something bad about a woman on the left and so I think that it is more left than it is Pro woman because when they choose between their politics and agenda they always seem to choose the politics over the agenda that's my eyesight's leftist rather than then Pro woman I agree and I think there's there's a lot of really emotional and non objective thinking attached to feminists and then there's a lot of there's a lot of really strange the the one of the more recent ones that I find incredibly strange is this there's this new trend of accusing men of rape if they have sex with a woman who's had something to drink this is a broad sweeping thing that's going through the internet and a lot of these it's really weird because it seems to be there's a lot of it of this what they call a skeptical community and the skeptical community seems to be have like integrated with a lot of male feminists and feminists and this is something that they've adopted this idea that somehow another skepticism and this idea that they combine and I it's I don't know if you're aware the the case the Michael Shermer thing you know accused of some significant sexual impropriety way yeah no evidence other than a person who doesn't want to reveal their name yeah who he the guy who wrote the piece heard about secondhand yeah he didn't even hear about it directly from the person and this is the person who's supposed to have a Nazi okay don't understand these things obvious beats yeah he is going to sue now yeah it's the idea of that being the skeptic community I mean one of the things you learn as a skeptic when you're breaking down any idea whether it's a religious idea or whether it's an idea about an event that took place is that a person's eyewitness account of any individual event is suspect and that it's one of the worst forms of of evidence and it doesn't mean that a terrible thing didn't happen with this person but it does mean that if you look at the the in the context of the way it was explained in this guy's blog is that she was put in a position where she couldn't consent like what what kind of weirdo language is that and then the the corroborating evidence that he uses in this blog is that a woman went to a party with this guy and he kept getting her drinks and he was flirty and that she got drunker than she usually does and that's it that's the corroborating piece of evidence that the man and a woman who are both adults were drinking together and she got drunk I mean I you talk about removing yourself from personal responsibility the heat this guy was responsible for you getting drunker like that's insane like that's insane for a person to say this and he drinks what choice did I feminists like why how is it possible that a person who believes in the power of being a woman could think that a woman is so much weaker than a man that she can't control how much liquor she consumes when she's around a man yeah but the man somehow or another by being with her and drinking with her forces her to consume more than she normally would that's madness and there's no excuse cold I was drunk I mean try that the drunk driving right it's that point is that okay yes you had diminished capacity while you were driving but you were responsible for drinking and getting in the car it's the one time when we're willing to alleviate someone of their own personal responsibility and only women a man is more of a man who if a man advanced more responsible if a man and woman are drunk together but the woman feels bad about the encounter in the morning the man Baker leaving all the man was drunk as well but then men are always the aggressors and always therefore guilty I mean that's not humanism but that is taken and this is a long dark road that as a man and you know I'm sorry that if you're a woman it's really hard to get this we have had so much negativity over the past 40 or so years old at masculinity that I mean we were like half criminals just for breathing I mean if you look at the role models on TV how how men are portrayed you know the Homer Simpson's and the American dads or that front leg and either they dick we're all just idiots and sex-crazed and irresponsible and stupid yeah and the amazing thing is that it's true then if you look at the bell curve of intelligence for women it's kind of spikes in the middle so many more women are average intelligence than men now you still have you brilliant women you still have you're done with them but if you look at the bell curve of male intelligence much flatter which means that we have a lot more geniuses and a lot more complete idiots right and what's happened is everybody's focused on the idiots among men and have completely began to ignore all the brilliance that men bring to the world all of the amazing incredible inventions that men bring to the world and it's just with focusing on this low cluster which is incredibly biased it's like saying okay well blacks in America they commit lot more crimes and we're just going to focus on that and say that's all the blacks are that's all we're getting portray as blacks as criminals bla bla bla I would be incredibly racist but the sexism of portraying men as idiots because we happen to have more cluster as a gender on that side and completely ignoring all of the incredible stuff that brilliant men bring to the world it's incredibly sexist and it's really hard for for for people to see I mean I like the idea that the we're talking only of the idea that a woman can competently raise children without a man around it's just taken for granted now it's absolutely not true men are essential to the healthy raising of children but the idea that we would recognize that as the society is just we just the disposables it's also a very unfortunate situation when in garça feminism that a lot of people are dealing with their own personal experiences that they've had with a few asshole men in their lives in regards to them not being sexually attractive or not moving into a certain social group or not and then they have somehow or another extrapolated that that all men are pieces of shit and rapist or a massive amount of them need to be curbed and laws need to be change and if you get drunk with a girl and you have sexual or you're a rapist right I mean and a lot of this is based on own negative interactions with men and the stereotype of feminism unfortunately is like there's a name online this is feminism and it's a woman who has the political holding up a sign saying I'm a feminist and she's fucking 300 pounds and you know and everyone's like yeah that's feminism you know like this is yeah you're right it's a big fat ego that wants a fuck that's really unfortunate but the person the type of person that is a large unattractive woman is going to deal with an immeasurably it's gonna be so much harder for for her to find people were sexually attracted to her for her to find healthy relationships for her to you it's an unfortunate reality in this world is that if you are not sexually attractive you are not gonna have as easier ride when it comes to the opposite sex it's just a fact well I mean but sexually attractive is 300 pounds I mean somebody who's 300 pounds is for most people gonna be sexually unattractive but if they should lose weight and exercise that's sort of a different matter that's just kind of a basic human confidence but one of the things that I thought of like that grew up with a single mom and and we lived because single moms are usually brought crying I mean because it's a tough life and so when I grew up with a single mom everyone around me had single moms as well you know what's interesting is that the kind of men who float through single mom world they're not always the best kind of man right they kind of trash you right because like the really competent and successful and intelligent men aren't falling the girlfriend Fromm's of the single mom you know though rent housing get ups right right and so I think what happens is a lot of these women have grown up in single mom households or or in this sort of environment and so who the men who floating through that they tend to kind of be losers they tend to be pretty unstable they tend to be kind of parasitical they're you know they don't tend to be very the very best specimens of masculinity and so I think the breakdown of the family has created an environment where a lot of girls growing up don't have a positive male role model in their life and the kind of men that they see floating through their moms bats tend to be kind of trashy so they're like well this is masculinity it's also very unfortunate that in the criticism of masculine you removed a lot of allies you know abide by blanket generalizations of men you removed a lot of people like myself who I can't support you on that even though I'm an entirely pro human being and pro-equality but when you make these mass generalizations and call someone a men's right advocate asshole like that these these are nonsense statements and it's unfortunate that I guarantee you these it's not saying that all feminism feminists are unattractive or all feminists or you know not not not sexually viable but I guarantee you almost all of them have had a lot of negative experiences with men and it doesn't mean that all men are negative and it doesn't mean that there's not people out there that you would assume with the assholes that are actually very nice people but you've got this this idea that's it's easier to define the world by these rigid dimensions that you've sort of set up for yourself and when I when I when I read things that are from this feminist point of view there's so often aggressive and it's so often and I get that there's a blowback I do get that I get that they've experienced marginalization they they believe that you know society is set up to support rape culture and all these strange ideas and that there's a blowback to it but I don't think that the way it's being handled is I think it's I don't think its objective I don't think it's irrational and I don't think it's balanced and I find it really weird when really intelligent people attach themselves to these feminist ideas yeah and and but the problem is you know in Canada here I had a guy on my show a great guy Bill Garrett who wrote at the end of the family and he pointed out that there's a revolution that occurs I think that initially is necessary and I think this is also a blacks in America too there's a revolution that occurs that is initially necessary but the whole point of a revolution is to define itself to end right so yeah I mean there was stuff that needed to be done obviously we talked about this earlier with blacks in the 60s and some stuff with women is kind of different right so because women there's always been this women and children first right like the vast majority of the people who died at the Titanic were men offering up their lifeboats to right because that has been a Selleck women and children first and women have been kind of elevated there was no black people first in the South write it right there so it's a little bit different but there was I think some push for equality that needed to happen but then what happens is you get a lot of people who get heavily invested in this course and they becomes the female their identity right like I fight for black whites I fight for women's rights and so on but then what happens in society you will often listen and respond in a positive way and then what happens is that course begins to diminish and people are like you know supporting like I'm not gonna support you the abolitionist course because slavery is ended like I'm just not going to do it it's over right I mean there may be other problems but that's not the problem right like I don't support a lot of you know that's let's deal with polio victims because we've got this vaccine if we not really have polio victims anymore right so the whole point of revolution is to defund itself to end for people to move on but their lives but what happens is when you have a government you get these voting blocs and you can like in Canada over the last 10 or 15 years the Canadian government's giving 300 million dollars to feminist groups that's not coming from Canadian women or Canadian men for that Americus you know a lot of its kind of being dealt with but these groups continue by by poking these scabs and by continuing these grievances and by finding the Trayvon Martin situation blowing it up into a race war and all this kind of stuff a lot of the stuff has been dealt with but because the government's still given the money they still need to whip up these kinds of hysteria see it just to justify their own existence I mean a whole ponder of revolution is to end the whole point of I want to deal with measles it's get a vaccine and end measles you know taking the same amount of money to gear off the year but if you have a government finding it then you have to manufacture these grievances which just keeps things going again what's the point of revolution is a resolution yeah and this resolution never seems to come play it's never going to take place if your approach is imbalanced and there's just some things that are being some proponents of feminism there are endorsing one of them being the ability to withdraw consent equals rape the the ability that you can have for the fans after the fact yeah that's insane you consented like me giving you my coffee and then charging you with theft when you walk out the room yeah take my coffee oh office like he stole my coffee because I changed my mind after the fact lucky that well the idea is that a man can live a woman in order to get in bed with her and then if she can prove that he did that but she then he's a rapist he tricked her with his words yeah because of course women never lie I mean they don't use makeup they don't pump up their tits they don't ever falsify anything to elect a man because he's wealthy and hope to get pregnant with them either I mean I don't see any feminists that are decrying that and that's a that's a horrible affront to womanhood to think that the only way that you can make a living is to lie to a man and make him get you pregnant so that you can get money from him from then on I mean with feminists true feminists should be horrified by that that represent will focus on the false rape accusations yes it's all straight I picked these accusations which in some studies are twenty thirty or forty percent is a study on the air force but they actually even women who've withdrawn their accusations 20 30 or 40 percent of rank written accusation in some studies who knows what it is universally are our boss I mean how horrendous is that and women should be coming down so hard I'm willing to make false right great accusations because they make it so much harder for the woman who actually happened right because then there's that problem or cost per tunity and the problem with false rape accusation is a very few women face repercussions for them now am I in my book if you can you accuse someone of a crime and you lied you get the punishment they would have got you she has recently been released he got on tape this girl admitting that she lied about him being him raping her and her family received a million dollars or eight hundred fifty thousand dollars and now they you know they have to pay the money back but that's the extent of her punishment discount in jail for five fifteen years you know and now he's trying to Reaper soothe and whatever would still be there well not only that is just one of many I have three friends that were falsely accused of rape I also have friends that were raped I know that there's I know rape is real you know I have friends that have been roofie and you know got out of danger because someone recognized they had been drugged it's my it's very common you know rape is a disgusting horrible anti human crime and I think rapists should be treated the same way as murderers you're you're denying someone their humanity you're doing you're taking away something some part of them you're removing a part of what who they are as a person it's kind of permanent yeah somebody's Alicia bar you can get a new car but there's something about sexual violation that it's kind of a permanence it's horrible but so is lying about it that's horrible - lying about a rape is just as harmful other Belov we get a man raped yes yes and this idea of this idea of withdrawing consent you know and it's somehow or another you can do that and turn a guy into a rapist that'sthat's like a teen thing that's a you know you what you're doing is you're you're you're you're hating someone who's manipulative you're hating someone who can con you into bed but that's been what men have been trying to do since the beginning of time like you're eating in the game of courting a woman and there have been men that wear shoes that were they would never wear and watches me would never buy and cars they don't give a shit about an apartment that they decorate just to get the woman to believe that they're like this it's all alive my friend Brian you saw earlier tonight last night first show Bryan Callen so hilarious guy the first time they came over South spectrums single he had Jack Kerouac on the road sitting on his night table opened up with Anthony and I you know I'm a predator so I come over his house my bitch you ain't reading that you know I find weakness than people very quickly so I saw that I go you're not fucking reading that I go you're hoping a chick comes over and she sees that she's smarter than I am I did that there was a human walking book a brief history of time or whatever right and I had that on my yes and this woman I loved her to death we went out for a while this woman came over and just like I quote bullshit what'd she do she went over and she opened it and it creaks like an old boat spine was completely [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're a fucking human being
