hello freak bitches you can converse and like any type that the type of English we're talking right now almost which creates us weird tension between the things that you're discussing and how you're discussing them like for instance to have a guy just in conversational English talking about problems they're having with neighboring shamans and their own shaman putting curses on each other and like creates like there's like a strange tension between how it's being conveyed to you you know like how so like okay if you're talking conversational English I guess like oh yeah like it's almost like you'd want it to be when he's telling you this you'd almost want to be reading it in like closed caption then he'd be saying it in the indigenous language because it sounds weird to have to have an idea that's so foreign to us which would be like a battle of shamans battling over access to wild animals okay um to have that delivered in conversational English has struck me as unusual and because like usually when you're traveling you're getting all of your information like traveling in Bolivia a guy would tell a story and he'd tell a story in simcha an no woman say no simcha in Germany okay he told story inch Amane chu a person who spoke Spanish the person who speaks Spanish would tell it to a person no no come on a guy telling someone who speaks Tremonti in Spanish then that person telling it to a person who speaks Spanish in English and then that person giving you the information whoa when you get it it through that it takes on a mystical quality like you're crossing some space-time thing right we're seeing like these ideas discussed in their ancestral tongue okay yeah Tamara sent you a video of a guy talking about killing a Jaguar yes right the language you've never liked when he's speaking you're like I've never in all my travels I've never heard a language that sounds anything like that okay right here yeah use a kombucha bottle healthiest for a loop you've done this twice really yeah we've done this in a podcast for great for sure I like the fact that you're willing to do that - I don't think we'll be shown on YouTube though so we'll have to have to move away up all right guys deck out okay well it was great - there's a big opening yeah so it doesn't vacuum up how often DP DP serve every time you like one of them healthy water drinker dudes I pee a lot do you are you a healthy water drinker dude interesting detail this just happened oh you ran out hold on a second say we go three cycling every yeah hey something is that I'm pitching I got a strong grip I mean you can move it - take it like it's touched my bottle a cop not a bottle seems like oh man is going back in though I can feel it starting to slow back in that's that's not healthy I'm pissed I've been pitching too long should I pee into the cup a bottle yeah oh you asking it oh thanks man oh yeah a lot went back into my urethra Ari Shaffir couldn't hold in his pee ladies and gentlemen couldn't means wooden filled up one kombucha bottle his cap there fella and then filled it up again I had to go empty it out for him thanks for doing that pleasure friend yeah I didn't want to leave you hang in there dude really there was only one solution I almost went to the kitchen sink and then a bit like you then we have to rinse that it should be nasty do that bathroom sick of nasty you ever cleaner in here no oh fuck it looked like a bachelor we're on our way out of this oh man not that bad I just use the time to fucking tweet about my new record saying had a chick I kept tweeting that James Comey was it was all code for my new record that he wanted people to buy it I know I saw something Instagram post that had a coma endorsing your album yeah he's a big fan he said he wanted to talk about during the hearing because that's a big audience but apparently they would let them collusion between me and Comey would have fucked things up is that what it's called yeah well I actually it's funny because this guy up because they say there's a chance which looking less like this is Lu combs who's like my arch nemesis even I was a good dude I just whose up against me this week on the country charts my arm comes up my new album came out this week and I'm trying to beat him and I said on Twitter that Russians have colluded with Sony records to like have him outsell me and he kind of played along so we'll see I think I think I think they are I mean nationals definitely trying to keep me down are they really are they talking with you like how are they receiving you now now that you've become a mainstream success because I hear about you all the time Donnell cowboy Cerrone and I think you know that he listens to your music before he goes out fight Oh cowboy Cerrone reached out to me thanks to you he called he called me up and he was on the set of a movie with Michael Madsen and uh they go I don't know how it seems like last second but they go hey cowboy you got a scene tomorrow where you sing karaoke with Michael Madsen and he saw you on sing and he's like fucking eating pussy kicking ass the producers like fuck you Tommy but he's like I want to eat and pussy kicking ass he's like give the rights to this song's like I'll have it in like five minutes he just fucking calls me I call my peoples like now I'm in a movie with cowboy Cerrone and Michael Madsen singing eatin pussy kicking ass I stated in the trailer you know like you know rehearsing with Michael Madsen you know gets to the sucking dick Park I think he was just like what the fuck we sing in here man so it's just the it's the threat of losing everything and every day long mmm-hmm you know being ostracized by and sort of expelled into this world that you believe and have always believed is as evil and without hope and doomed so how did you do it how did you get all your stuff packed people coming in there saying yeah I mean like they're there they're trying to convince us but once they understand that we're not being convinced that that you know they they walked away so I mean on that night our dad dropped us off at a hotel and then Jesus Christ yeah like it's so immediate that you become this you become other you become an outsider like in the next morning when we went back I rang the doorbell I rang the doorbell it's your own house I had lived in that house from the day I was born whoa so you felt like you had to ring the doorbell it is not my world anymore yeah Wow like why are during the doorbell and there's like there's there's no water there's there is nothing else like it this is not our home this is not so we go and you know we're packing all of our things it was just it was awful just a I had been in those four months I had been so terrified of because I no knowing what was coming like just imagine you're going to lose everyone in your life they're just you're just going to you're not going to like how your parents met and fell in love or like your grandparents and family recipes and photos and memories and what did the houses I'm like taking photos and voice recordings and just all the time like an every it was just it's overwhelming its it made me at least understand that the source of my dissatisfaction in life wasn't internal it was it made sense it was a that I was having a healthy reaction to circumstances in society that humans were not adapted for and even that was enough to bring a kind of peace of mind for me I also very consciously and deliberately try to live in places where there is the possibility of a sort of close communal neighborhood I live in a very poor neighborhood in New York City and which for some of the hassles at least has the sort of rich fabric of human connection that you just don't get in wealthy neighborhoods so you do it on purpose oh yeah what would I don't want just say well you do you want to say where you live I live in the Lower East Side Manhattan and I mean I'm very very poor but it is a Dominican - Dominican neighborhood half the people in the neighborhood really don't speak English very well so it's a very it's a very rich or ethnic neighborhood people are quite poor and I and I know everybody everyone knows each other by sight and we look out for each other and I mean during hurricane hurricanes when Hurricane sandy hit New York I mean a lot of the people that had young children had to leave because there was no light there was no water the power was out right - half of Manhattan was completely dark it was really actually quite dangerous at night in the dark half of Manhattan and where there was no streetlights and so this building it's a tenement building that I live in with my wife and and a lot of the people left and that they were worried about being robbed and these are poor people right is not a wealthy building at all it's quite quite poor building and so they organized a guard shift one of the people one of the women in the building had a machete and they organized guard ships at the front door with a machete and the young men in the building took turns like two hours at a time guarding the building with a machete oh yeah and you know I wasn't associated with the building at that time but boy would that it made me feel good to be part of that that you know what I mean like that is what human beings that's what they are right it's that right and you didn't see that in a wealthy neighborhood partly because the wealthy neighborhoods actually in light right [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
