efficient with the battery software and everything the road still looks dope it looks like a combination of a Ferrari and Lotus one outside you never seen it no pull up that uh my problem with the Tesla right now is that it did the battery doesn't last long enough it just doesn't I don't have anywhere to charge it'll get better though it could like the newer ones that every year to get better

or someone is it take it it looks very similar that but way cooler how much is that - how much that roadster Tesla they don't know yet because it hasn't been released but I'm under 200 yeah look at that why does not look nearly that's a nice pretty similar beautiful it looks way better and I must say because my good friend Elon Musk makes it by the way we're good friends we text each other do you on Musk I'm his friend that's got bottom o'clock see that clock over there I got him one of those TGT studios clinical no big deal nothing weird about that don't be scared that week is he still trying to build that subway underneath demo you're trying to LA everything he's if you if you like talk to him in private - I wish I could try his brain out for a day and find out what's going on in there but it's just rattling around information constantly things are flying around and he just could just grab it and stuffing it into boxes and digging holes under the ground and shooting things to the moon he's just he just his brain just doesn't stop it's he's single is now Hollow when you talk to guys like that who are lateral thinkers like you realize like the guy who made me feel really dumb and and almost like a fraud was Brendan Schaub not bread Peter Thiel I was listening to him talk you know I went yeah I met him at dinner with at his house tonight and I was like he was talking and I realized everything I say is basically an amalgam of the things I've read or heard and this one's right those there yeah he just thinks up things on his own like he started PayPal with him on god damn that's all those boys got rich yeah PayPal it's one of the ways well whenever you think you're a black belt you realize you're a white belt go buddy Pat I said to me Elon Elon went on the podcast when you asked him a question though he really downloaded that data before a gaming in oh well he's mom cause he's he's I would say he's very he's enthusiastic almost like a child with certain things on with his blowtorch gun and stuff like that but when it comes to thinking about things like he'll just sit down and pause before he gives you an answer he wants like really compared smart cuz I just go up and then fuckin Tesla he's thoughtful but that's also one of the charms of you is that you say stupid shit that you wish you didn't say right after you said it right right after you said I know he's like god damn I probably should have said that yeah might I say sure yeah yeah look how well it's going yeah I mean you do know time special fucking not even right how many years in a comedy blast raunchy film it - and change - and change at South sac that's outstanding I say stick with what got you to the dance verbal diarrhea just keep going til I get assassinated you saying funny shit mad shit which guy I say crazy shit what's the referee wearing that the referee is like wearing something around his waist launch no no it's like a it's an electronic search needs a fanny pack is it maybe he says a fat dick maybes good cuz he knows who I'm saying both sides he's carrying something looks like in the front maybe it is a fanny pack um Tim we don't know who's fighting jingling jingling jingling Oaks watching at home four minutes and thirty seven thirty six 35 34 33 seconds into the first round dude fuck this card if it aint Chuck Tito Oh they find today yeah that's fine they're fighting tonight is there an undercard for that or they just a car boy it's in great shape right yes they both looking great so it's rich Chuck has a gigantic vein across his bicep they've been tested - good sign she always had that like kind of his belly always sticks out we call it the power gun how a gut he's always had that even when he was at the top of the food chain when he was the best like oh shit the water clip dude damn jingling jingling even when chuck was at the top of the food chain he always had that oh it's just how he's built he's just built odd Tito was pointing at it it was really funny he was like making fun of him but he was wearing a shirt yeah he didn't have it didn't make any strange shirt the whole thing's been a little strange well I think they should have done like because those guys should go out on their shields as hall-of-famers I think I wish you know Chuck said when they wanted to do the fight he called Dana Dane was like get the fuck out or ain't happening good luck though and so I wish they were done like a tough finale or like a big card and they're just like a feature fun know what I I support everyone's right to do whatever they want to do whenever they want to do it as long as they're not hurting anybody and this goes into that right I support you right the bull ride I support your right to skydive yeah do whatever you want to do man and if these guys like what is what it was our thought and if they don't do this they're gonna live forever no I mean they know the risk they're big boys yeah you know the real question is like should they be doing they went through all the testing because I said I truck in two I'm both on my show nice Chuck I'm like you've gone through all the testing with Commission California's when I was fighting going through California commissions they're by far the strictest you do not want to fight here if you're taking protein powder through the worst Chuck psychic I went through all the California Commission shit I'm like damn well only thing I'm a big fan of this guy who runs it in California Andy Foster he's a beast he's really on top of the ball super proactive he's really smart he used to fight himself lifelong martial artist and full respect for the sport a super progressive about people's weight cuts doesn't want people cutting a shitload of weight in this state he tries to monitor the hydration wants to get your weight out in advance he's ahead of it with everything not a another dinosaur he said no he's ahead of it also with weight classes they instituted more weight classes in California so you guys aware of how one Fc does there yes they don't there's no weight cutting Man 3 no weight cutting they do hydration tests yeah they do hydration tests you fight whatever is closer to your natural way with their do that one Fc 100% is doing it better than anybody else Hanabusa you know the problem that is though some wealth away Conti yes they stopped the weight cutting it's not necessary to the divisions the division is what you weigh what so Ben Askren went up to 185 he was 170 and they jumped him up to 185 which is like his real walk around weight you know and he still they determine what that weight is there's got to be an official land has got a showing look you could always manipulate your weight and stay healthy within a certain range of your disciplines still they say liking you would still be hydrated so if you like say if you said your best weight is 165 you just decided that all you would have to do is make sure you got your body weight down and do it over a long period of time so that you're you know you doing cardio you're eating right you making sure and then keep your weight in that range like you could decide to fluctuate ten pounds one way or the other and still be fairly healthy it's just a matter how much certain kinds of exercise you do and how much time but the thing about the certain kinds exercise is once people got some power they don't want to give that power right and if you're like 175 but jacked and you really would be better off 165 but a little thinner yeah you know what called you're wise a lot of guys don't want to give up that path but also you know some guys are huge for their weight class and for whatever reason like their until and who's the guy in belt or who lost rory mark them in the fun title fight Rory MacDonald Lima those guys are giant for their weight class and I think sometimes some people have the kind of body like some people have a body like they have they have their 230 but their weight on their ass and legs and they have small upper bodies and maybe that's not as good as someone like I don't know who has like their until to Jill's buddy that's all well and good but the real thing should be what do you really weigh yeah all the other stuff is bullshit all the other stuff is just we've just agreed upon this because we've been doing it this way for so long it should be get to a healthy weight what do you weigh and there's got to be more weight loss well it's right we're all we all - copy interesting just the hydration that they make a urine a B and they check your urine and they check the weight of your urine that's one of the ways there's a bunch of different sophisticated ways to do it but wait yeah because the more minerals and the more stuff is in your your urine it indicates how much water you have in your body like what you know what percentage of water you have in your body whether or not you're dehydrated just make sure I might be wrong about this so these bubbles so when you pee a clear that means you're more hydrated yes yes and necessarily know if you've taken a bunch of vitamins yes still piece right yellow yeah oh my shit will be some of it does come out in your urine but some of it still is getting absorbed in your body it's not all of it that's going out in your urine it's still a good idea to take multivitamins one Fc hired Miesha Tate - yeah I was like the she's moving there she's gonna come to Singapore now I think it's a smart move man she's a smart girl Sam ports a great fleshly hey man I might they might seriously be looking at hers like a big-time executive like the female Dana White for for Asia sounds like that's what you're doing well rich Franklin's doing it too though right isn't he have a big we roll over there as well yeah huge role does he do over there I'm not sure what he does but he did he's got a he's got like some kind of executive job and does he live in Singapore as well was headed there they're not gonna commit to you unless you commit to that now did Brandon Berrett just one did he it was that in one Fc you see his fight yeah - Brandon Berrett just like two years stood still doing it Oh monster it looks amazing dude he looks so did I be sporty wasn't he an Olympic croco guy Brandon Berra no mom he was a very big very very good wrestler and you know what the funny thing is is really what he's known for is his kickboxing amazing you know he had a hard time in the UFC dude because there was this there was this one period of time where they were in contract negotiations and I feel like he lost a lot of momentum there because remember he cuz he beat Frank Miller and goes and then goes I'm gonna be the light heavyweight champion and heavyweight champion yeah what's up and then there were issues yeah then there were minute he was like out for a while man he got he knows we came back and the didn't he also fight Fabricio Werdum and he got trapped under the mount wasn't it for Doom who TKO'd him was it for doom I remember you like ver doom just handled him I remember you realize he had really good Jiu Jitsu remember he submitted us what's that dude's name Brazilian cat fuck friggin his name nobody Smurfs where you're so funny dude I was there with him at eggplant one day but he in a few times yeah but he was also trained by a homeboy Rob Kaman no he was in San Diego Alliance but he was a black belt who's the black dude the boy to Irvin yeah I was like yeah he's a little boy too Brandon what's great is how does wrestling and his grappling was like what you would think if you looked at his skillset but it's like he just got so good at striking like early on he was known more of a striker than anything by far yeah do you remember when Frank Mir came back after the motorcycle accent like here's Brandon beer and Brandon bear went cool story knee knee knee and just fuck them Octomom a head kick knockout two in the UFC big-time head kick well Frank Mir with a head kick who smashed his nose his nose got so fucked up and once I remember yeah his no and nose was literally completely fine he's had some tough fights man and listen whatever you see him soccer kid dude dude wrong when they let him kick people on the ground that's why he's so now dude he's so Jack now he's some poor soul he fought was like other soccer kicks not worried you you're allowed to kick that guy's are on the ground soccer kick from combat in style it's bad that's not a good look on their back it's fighting get it doing good that friend that soccer head kick they'll make you rethink you and the soccer head think there's so much power in that part of the game it's probably the most powerful kick you could do honestly it's like it's one of those weird kicks it doesn't really show up in martial arts except if they're you know you allow someone to kick someone when they're down because that's the only time or ever you can generate that kind of power because if you really think about it like everything else you got to kind of teach your foot to do this yeah you got to teach your body to do this teach yourself but this this kid does that everybody talking about the Charlie Brown that's the Charlie Brown's from like one foot away fuck everybody I do that Jamie brings a brand of air up first taking some space looks like a video game I need to see him cuz he used to be flat it's like Street Fighter dude he's eating a lot of steak yes what do you think he's like to now 240 maybe and that's just one that's just one look at this was do this oh Jesus so this one is lettuce that's not a bad that's just one there's another one when he's head kicking the guy wall the guys down it just sucks he was like the first real and a big-time athlete I did that I remember god but some people think that this is a better way to express fighting because this is realistic like disagree I like any guys are steady love that shit to barbaric I would like to see head butts bring that below this fight is over that's camp bullet train rounds we're not even paying attention to fight at all we're watching extraneous fights this is when people get mad no intention of these fights fuckin war this is a good fight there's actually a really good fight and you know UFC fight pass is working on getting this league that I think it's in Burma where it you just wrap your hands it's Muay Thai kickboxing with head butts yeah legal its what does it call Lech way how do you say it yeah it's called let let let way and that's where something like their hands yeah they wrap their hands up with something I'm not sure it barely survived good head butts are legal yes holy Sh so frank grillo in fight world went to Cambodia and lived with them and study with them and the problem is they don't have ice in Cambodia they're so poor so when they get hit in the face and stuff there if they just stay swollen so three rounds left way against the ropes boom just do just drop and are you allowed to hit to the back of the head I'm not sure about that you know Eddie and I've talked about this a hundred times but it's it's an important fact that when you watch head kicks there's a lot of the time head kicks are landing to the back of the head like you say you can't hit some in the back of the head right it's not supposed to be legal if I go over your shoulder and I kick you in the back so do punch is yes like a lot of light hands up guy turn it hit them right my fucking back then bring up bring up Ernesto host when he hits Maury scream if I'm Maurice Smith yeah dude he wraps his head around your fucking head and his neck just goes around your head his neck just went boom yeah oh that was that was tough I was good friends and Maurice when that was going on Maurice was was fighting when you know he probably shouldn't have been done doing demos - well Ernesto host is you know but I mean he was fighting like pro kickboxing while he's also doing MMA and like Maurice is a world-class kickboxer but I really think for you too find a guy like Ernesto Hoost you kind of have to be kickboxing all the time we all in yeah and yeah and Maurice like for real was a super skilled world champion kickboxer but he had been doing oh how do you look at that he lifts his watch says dude he was so good honest imperfect how many fights against Bob Sapp yeah those leg kicks man they're the best sort of the way he punches though yeah he Paul he did everything awesome the thing about him didn't you know here's another one look at him now look at he looks like a super fighter game too right doesn't he look like some kind of video game character in these images well then show to him early in his career he was a bag of bones man really yeah he was skinny what do you think yeah for real he was real thin he was very long and almost like style bender like great and then he got super Jack Crow cop dude his leg kicks were sensational how about what Bob Sapp beat him yeah that was a real fight fuck dude Bob Sapp is a giant human being 75 a lot of fights how dare you he's right Bob Sapp out the fuck up shoulder was it Ernesto remember they kept him in and that's what stopped the fight no no no no that was a different fight I think you're thinking of a different from hell I'm not one of them had a really fucked-up shoulder he kept kicking it and he's like nast okay maybe sure that's the opposite I had to be one that he lost because he won the two fights that he had against Ernesto that I'm aware of box I did didn't I Eddie Bob Sapp beat Ernesto yeah they beat him shoulder I don't remember the second fight or if they even fought twice or three times I guess I just remember Bob stop beating him do you know when you really think about him and you know Maurice Smith work with Bob Sapp as well taught him a lot about kickboxing but when you think about maurices like the first real high level kickboxer to become successful at MMA yeah right the first world champion when you remember when he fought Conan Silvera and had kicked him everybody was like you can't beat a Brazilian jiu-jitsu blackbelt you're definitely not gonna beat him and Coleman memories for Coleman dude and he was yeah so was i we right that's why to guess right we're there together goddamn I remember 1996 holy shit right 96 nine so nothing was 97 97 it might have even been 98 he kept saying come on come on come on yeah mom our crowning compound you saw and you saw it mark at one point got kicked one too many times just wet stopped and everywhere oh you know he hiked down more he slipped a couple times he did problem was Maurice Smith has a very good defensive guard yeah high level recovery and there's also an easy 230 like just angle and he actually played lock down - yeah yeah he did yeah look Maurice Smith is a smart guy and his his kickboxing was so high level man when he started fighting these MMA fighters they realized that he could defend himself off of his back but if you're standing up with him you're just fucked man yeah the problem was Mark Coleman wasn't never really worked on his guard passing back then yeah you know what I mean he just he just assumed that when you take someone down you just get on top of them and beat the shit out of him but that's true if you don't have good any kind of guard but yeah Maurice Smith had a professional defensive guard yeah yeah and also this is the headbutt days I was head bud days yeah yeah yeah when I don't think they fought guard loves you would over hook here dad loves right oh yeah they definitely yes yes I kick do you remember the gosh the guard the most important guard position when there's headbutt sorry loud growl - grab the back of the head no did he win a side kick straight to the gut damn Jesus Iseman he's got some great fights in the UFC man John Jones dropped Vitor Belfort with the front leg side kick was amazing I've never seen that I was a front leg side kick one of the most underrated kicks you just don't do it that good you think Vitor Belfort each side tonight were chucked him rushes the cage and says I won't fight both you pussies that he's just fucking juice to the elves were like yeah um if the UFC let him go over there if they leave right I think they know do it and they'll put they'll have him too you know if they just you got a regulate medication okay make sure that everything's okay come on I mean if they're testing Chuck and Tito you got a test Vitor you can't veto a cafe in Cali let's not do that okay let's only have them fighting like let's be on an Indian Reservation I don't want any 170 dude Hudson Ibby over some Neil Magny I may be is a real problem Magne I don't know if it's the jetlag or what he's my boy but he was a late starting he had ate the fuck up yeah he got chewed up you got chewed up sitting out you poked in the eye like early in the first round then you just couldn't decide like death you have no idea what to do so he's just always like wait oh fuck yes that's a real problem and and you know there's a solution in the works I can't talk about it I'm sweaty I pokes goggles you know the feds never have a better glove design that there were you please do it but someone should I also say anything George said too much try and get cohan's a dude I also heard they're doing something about the rumor it's a supermoon right store anything what you saw it in 2009 oh really boom leave that side kick to the body and the nasty left hands you mean they might get rid of you SATA or back to you old days as crazy I don't know I read this may be a little that is so crazy side kick to the body but especially the way he threw it I mean he really got his weight behind it you could fuck people up with that man set of lips on him it's like we all accept that the front leg side or the turning side kick or spinning back kick we all accept that puts people out right well how much harder is your turning side kick than your front leg side kick lay harder yeah but significantly but how much does it take really to make your body cave in because my front leg sorry sidekick is way harder than my left hook way harder your front foot front leg psyche you really so yeah so if you if you think like of course you can left hook someone in the body and drop them and fuck them up at you hit him and liver right well why wouldn't you think that you could do that also with the front leg psychic on a regular basis yeah just gotta have a quick or snap to it that's what most a long time to develop that's what it does it takes you got to develop that quick snap and that's what most guys are missing most guys it comes out to slow the body the body's more designed for a left hook that you can keep the powering left hook probably you're in your 60s versus a frontside kick is an athletic move judge the state is just a little way too much no well really W song a little bit but not like crazy he's a good kicker yeah nothing like no nothing like a crow cop type character there's no one in the there's no one in the UFC big guys there's really not that's a kicker well well this must be someone we're not thinking of Marcin Tabora kicks a lot but these are not like a heavyweight barboza know like just monster with the kids yeah I was hoping that was gonna be something we would acquire right like get some sort of Rico Verhoeven type character yeah cuz he's fighting MMA and he's training at a K we'll listen stand up wise he's on not just one level but so many levels above most people in MMA right reach over Hooven it's a mind Farah straight stand-up but that doesn't always tremble it doesn't translate now it doesn't translate you got a have you got like the distance is different the timing your stance Verhoeven is something special and he's a he's a big giant guy have you ever seen him right no crazier yeah obviously a Dutch guy do I look fat Dutch indeed really yeah he's uh he's about 240 plus pounds and the guy has mad cardio it's one of the crazy things about him he puts a crazy pace on these guys and he's a striker have you seen some of them ma fights know who the fuck is fighting that poor soul maybe he just have mercy want some that be luck is going some night yeah see if you can find out I mean I'd use I have to use my kicks dude anything baby is a take a training with D CK hey guys I've sparkly bro what the fuck he's showing us giant Dutchman Friant Dutchman find a highlight reel find a highlight reel he's a monster dude oh and great hair too and he's a young guy guys I mean I don't even know a ball behind I survived its beats of the best the world of all the guys nothing guys not exactly my uncle no take a beating know that big guys supposed to be super tough for sure look at that but people like that kind of shit you know it's like people of when big boy wins by knockout they trust yes they do in that we're like at must do fucking tons of cardio be just gut just stay just ate the wrong food bro look at that fuckin combo but look at his kicks man I mean reek over my son go to his MMA fight some guy gets fucking starched

don't know if they're the biggest people in the world but they I heard there's a tallest people in the world dude I'd love to see him announcer over him go out in a moon a big boy ouch dude would take him down for sure the house was very good grab but Alistair would definitely stand up with him for a little bit for sure which is what he does but he would take him down Alistair very underrated grappler amazing grappler yeah and his ground-and-pound will fuck you up it's a real problem ready he's used don't for his guillotine for a little bit yeah and it's also he's just had so many more MMA fight I'm fighting for a hundred years yeah he's good at everything but Verhoeven was it he hasn't he has an advantage over basically everything right now in heavyweight soccer has that smooth build to where you just like you know what oh my god but what's interesting is sake what is he fighting 185 in the UFC yeah 205 your Wi-Fi please should be a 185 yeah that's yeah that's where it is right

I was not avoiding him I like how he's punching the ribs from them now Oh does that fight he's so hard man he said when you get a real strike on top of you that it actually could turn their hips generate the force yeah do you remember when cro cop got on topic Gabriel Gonzaga the rematch the revenge fight the elbow smashed him with elbows oh they were horrific horrible horrific and then who did then Gabriel got good with elbows from the bottom didn't he fucked somebody up from the bottom looking looking to your I favor in this corner there here it is this is this is more that's the same one or the video is more recent this is Rico Verhoeven this looks like the same fight like it is a knit one that difference how many have you had is it that looks like the 6-4 kickboxer I'm not not bad passing yeah I mean he's gotta learn right he's also smart so like that what got him to become an elite kickboxer that kind of intelligence as well as hard work he's just gonna translate that to MMA he's just got to make sure that he fixes the holes in his game he's at the right Camrys he likes about the right can't fake a with the wrestlers like these are hard fucking punches man look at this clean and room for your body just lifting a leg up I think only one time ever maybe twice have some someone gotten knocked out while they were being while they were mounting somebody from the bottom really they're saying the gun mount got knocked up yeah my gosh is up yeah it's happened yes once maybe twice it's in Paris I want it's getting knocked out while you're being mounted I mean ah wow you're mounted sorry season I think Duane Ludwig and when it wasn't that something that it happened in in Japan yeah oh man I'm trying to remember this Duane love weights fight yeah why don't I feel like Duane Ludwig did it Oh Eve Edwards Duane Ludwig did it to Eve Edwards he hurt him like really bad and Eve like covered it up and he was nothing yeah Eve was on top and Duane punches in the bottom and heard of really bad he talked about it on the podcast now I remember dude how long has this fight taken to get to this point what's going on here I feel like well they're they're in China so where they're at maybe they just given us chance to settle in China's communist right not really they're not really capitalist country okay there are there a command economy though like so where a lot of the decisions are made by the Politburo by the by the actual government and then from there the flag looks like the Soviet Union flag yeah well Chad it's still Red China right there was a communist revolution not anymore though it's weird that is it's not - ah a democracy no you know when I went to notion for Abu Dhabi and in the hotels boom they have the TV on with with the propaganda oh yeah how long ago your total talking shit on the United States really good this yeah there it's a documentary that's on you know it's the default setting on your TVs and in Beijing we get there you sit down to watch TV in a documentary on how bad the United States is going this is why we're doing what we're doing look at the amount of shows the United States is you know it they're just going you know down down the list of all the things that the United States does that when you go detrimental to society did you have to do your fingerprints on the machine you get all your fingerprints are recorded and then you're given at least when I was shooting a movie you were given a we were just there right yeah you were given a memo to say if you in no political dissent like you will not voice your political point of view if it's contrary to the government's you know live I don't know why if you do that you'll be asked to leave or you could be in some American kid like trying to steal something that was yeah that was balls on ball son yeah the UCLA basketball team stole like some sunglasses yeah and fucking Trump had to help get him out they don't fucking hear that he's super fucked whoo but Deng Xiaoping said famously to be rich is glorious which was so contrary to the Communists that's cool as fuck that they're the UFC in there so yeah it can't be that it's a huge market everybody wants the Chinese well that's the next big push for the UFC right I mean internationally they're growing you know you're not getting Google you know when we tried well you'd have to keep trying to find servers that would that would provide Google and the Internet in China look at you two the access of yes and then they find you and they chop that down another one so anybody who worked on the set who woman anybody worked in a set couldn't get you're given a phone there so when as an actor I was given a phone with WeChat fine it's a phone issued to me that I can use there I can't use technically my phone and linked into the World Wide Web too many firewalls yeah they you and then by the way if you want to use your phone you download something called WeChat which is an app which you know it's controlled by somebody so it's so there's a lot of groupthink there's zero there's zero dissent and if you say something derogatory about the government disappear like and something like WeChat they probably monitor it Jesus man fucking monitor course they monitor of course they do it's an amazing example of how you can control a lot of people but you know that North North Korea you don't even there is no internet correct no they get knowing or no that's Korea no TV channels or speech I know I talked to a friend phone works for the government and his wife works for the government too and they had to go to Russia for something and he said they were you were told just absolutely think you're being followed everywhere you go yeah assume they're listening to every word you say assume yeah that your your hotel rooms bugged yeah and then where you go you're being followed that's right it's kind of like the state's more sweet chat is recording private messages for Beijing to ion user yes did you even use the phone really not you text me right now and tell me how bad it's been happening already for a while don't we already know that they're like yeah it's just bottom line is firmed like that it just freaks people out as well it should but you know we're we're just we forgot how this is why freedom of expression and freedom of speech in this country is so important because wow this is happening here in the United States and and freedom of speech is you know something that gets up for debate sometimes it's like who gets to decide who gets to say this and gets to say that what should we stop the problem with any kind of censorship is right while we're here being able to talk shit on the podcast there are a big giant spots of the world filled with billions of people that can't do this right if they do is they would get arrested like what comes get locked up that's exactly right podcast we we do podcast kamo no fucking chance the Arab world I mean one of the things that come out smiling is in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar and what's come out is that these governments are saying these these the royal family of the people that are in power they go whoa there's political dissent so you've got journalists or people who form groups that for say let's say democracy or elections and guess what they hire American mercenaries there's just a whole black water dude guys like that they fight hire Americans to take care of their terrorist problem and they're terrorists probably goes that they get as long as the American company gets issued weaponry and orders from the standing army then they can do whatever they want to use this great and so this all kid what was the article I just read it was fascinating it was in the New York Times but it was just exposed where there are these ex badass Special Forces guys making a fortune essentially acting as mercenaries in countries like the United Arab Emirates etc to get rid of their terrorist problem now that's the royal family saying it's a terrorist problem when it could very well be just a political group but they're getting killed what's terrible so you know but the bigger issue in this country is apparently from what I'm seeing in my own experience is that when you put a certain ad on Facebook and Facebook besides to that ad might be offensive to someone might count just got flood you okay and and so even if you say get in the best shape your life or whatever it might be that might make other people feel uncomfortable for whatever reason is either a bot an algorithm or somebody is flagging that ad or shutting down your account and I know a number of people that that's happened to oh so what the fuck is going on there but but you know also too is if let's say you do in an ad or you do a post on Instagram let's say you have 2 million followers on how many you have let's see of 60 million and you do a post you know they limit to how many people it reaches now you have to pay extra to make sure it reaches that since when does Isis promote your post like Wyatt fucking sick that's wise yeah here yeah it's kind of smart yeah this person likes a smart doesn't mean it's not fucked up one of those fitness people that grow their Instagram by just putting ass Barry not there's dudes too there's guys that I follow that are just like super jacked and they're doing like one-arm chin-ups and shit and you follow flips yeah dudes settle down man take it easy both oh they're always in a gym where they can workout shirtless everyone's shirtless but then do an impressive shit there's like a bunch of them that I follow okay but where you say on my point you made me nervous posts man they'll reach all these extra people their thing will grow their business will grow I'm a fan of that what I'm not a fan of is I would I have a question about is or is there some buddy in charge of what's what's permissible and what's not according to a certain code of conduct and do they have a political agenda so in other words so if I put out something that has profanity or maybe a stand-up clip where I want to get people in it's it's a clip that is offensive to said personal touches yeah they can go no flag you stopping them from doing that same star but but see with the with the dudes with their shirts off flex and shit when they're trying to get clients that's fine we're and they can promote reach other people outside there one should be if you have 100,000 followers it should reach all hundred thousand yeah I see what you said what's crazy to me yeah they're gonna lose everybody there's gonna be a new Instagram if they start doing that shit and gets out of hand people just leave well there's you know what shadow banning is right no there's a concept of shadow banning and I don't know if this is Jamie would be able to speak to this better than me has that ever been proved that they actually do shadow band people what's that or is that it's they look very honest is that if you say were on Twitter and maybe you were conservative and you said a lot of rude things about liberals that maybe they would decide that although it doesn't violate the Terms of Service what you do is makes them uncomfortable they make a moral judgment and they decide to limit your engagement talking about yeah this is somehow possible no this is greater but is that like a hater it's not when what you're saying with the paying of post to it happens similarly there - if you were a an account that never paid yeah and once you pay once you give them five bucks you're you're like flag now as an account that will pay right we're talking about Twitter it's it's Twitter you don't the board yeah you can pay on Twitter - how do you pay on Twitter do you pay on Twitter you don't have to but you're you can you can pay yeah Promoted Tweets it's a promoted post we a top trending topic for the last year - is paid it says paid or promoted really yeah you just have to oliver i go into it because they get money now that's how well who's been banned from Twitter a lot of people man banned from Twitter yeah ban more conservatives or conservatives but liberals I ban to this do liberals that have put out death threats they've been banned but General Bob siders no no that's a good question we should find out what is the what is the summer should be banned banned banned that's a good question too is it too expensive the violate their Terms of Service and definitely if you incite violence that's definitely a no-no racial slurs or no no racist so you can call my area fuckhead you can call someone a fuckhead but you can't call them like a guinea fuckhead yeah yeah there's like there's certain things you can say in third and certain things you can't say but it's a lot of its objective yeah but then someone it's pretty black and white like if you're like man I want to go if don't you blow up that fucking school yeah those corners of course with the racist stuff yeah yes all of that I think you gotta regulate the hate too it was just bullying and shit like that yeah expand them Wow it's like here's the question and this is who gets to decide who what's hateful and what's not and the problem is they keep pushing it further and further and further and then even just insults are hateful even even like this guy is a dumbass yeah that's hateful saying someone's a dumbass is hateful I mean they're gonna there's only so far you can you could keep going down that road right you want to make sure that you have free expression you don't get free expression if you ban people from saying things that just don't seem that bad to me about Alex Jones you think his banning would like to see what he says Sandy Hook stuff sandy but here's the thing getting sued for that anyway here's the thing yeah he was already getting sued for that like What did he say that got him I think something happened that he did had nothing to do with even what he said he confronted them at some event right and he was yelling in the back and that's right anything that happened after he confronted people in Congress and well Alex Jones has a regular on former CIA officer dr. Steve P chanak he has him on like once every six months that's where he got the Sandy Hook information was from him that dude is on the CIA guy know about Sandy Hook the fuck would he know that's a dumbest fucking thing that Alex Jones has ever done it's also a moral and fuck ste and whatever if he said it didn't fuck him - yeah yeah you have to always wonder and you would you I mean I'm not making any accusations but you'd have to always wonder when you hear story like that why would someone say something so ridiculous and why would someone try to convince someone like Alex Jones of something so ridiculous and I think there'd be two reasons one to discredit Jones if you could talk him into repeating what you said he's you think he's willing to do that's interesting you can easily discredit him and it would be a really good way to do it like the best way to do it that's thank you what I'm saying well he's just right or not but he's right or wrong dr. Steve Buscemi said it several times on the show so but he's not Alex for but ours to believe him no he's hearing it from a guy who's in the CIA like this it's not crazy for him to believe in a guy from you know he may or may not be right but he started with Alex actually saying he said unfortunately he goes at something to the effect of I saw it it was very sad and then but unfortunately I've seen a lot of soap operas I've seen a lot of and and and I know an actor when I see one and that's where it started with you see it that way yes and he's being you know he's being sued by dropping be a good acting coach but remember he knows inactive with me in court and they said with the foot basically what the fuck you're doing goes listen I I say a lot of things just for entertaining of course like it's just for but during his that is trial with his wife yeah he's like I don't believe it a lot of I just say he's got a business yeah well the thing about all a lot of nutrition people a lot of people is you make money you make money in this in this business in weather weather whatever it is whether it's being a political pundit or saying entertainment on an exercise guy you make money having answers if you're somebody who's more scientific and says I don't know it depends maybe you're not gonna make money when you say bone broth cures cancer you're gonna sell books when you say my plant-based diet is proven to do ba ba ba e this whatever you're gonna make money if you say I'm gonna I'll help you lose weight and keep it off in four month takes my money you're not gonna say hey I'm a nutritionist guy it's gonna take you two years we're gonna try to change life you can have bounced back so you have plateaus and being realistic yeah nobody's gonna buy that shit you see dong guy has a little movement man so but with uh with Alex Jones of is he banned for life or a business I don't nice toss his website he's got a big lawsuit but it's judge they got rid of his show happened all the flowers and shit no the only thing that happened is they pulled him off of youtube and they pulled him off a Twitter and a knife is booked in iTunes and he's got a major lawsuit with other that doesn't compromise Thursday's there's two guys there's two guys that are being sued over that Alex Jones and a guy named Wolfgang Helbig he's also he's also being sued that guy his job was to prepare schools for school shootings so he came out and he started saying that too so he's he's breaking apart Andy he started saying that yeah he's getting he's getting sued along with Alex Jones well but they didn't show up for when he went to court they never showed up so they dropped the case what about one thing about the law loft kind of weird no what's the why would Sandy Hook be fake let's not talk about this time oh I don't know I find it fascinating well like I in the world would it be fake Toby I know you get wrapped up like what it's a conspiracy there was zero zero thoughts that a that is fake but I do have thoughts on why someone would try to get other people to say it's fake and this if there's any if there's anything that's ever gonna convince you that conspiracy theories are stupid it's making up a fake conspiracy a easily provable fake conspiracy about a real tragedy that's a nice simple psychological way to discredit people if I thought you were a dumb ass but you had a big voice I might talk you into saying some shit about something that's not real and have you convinced it's real so you spout it out you look like a moron right and that discredits everything else you said that's right and you have to be really careful with a lot of these stories there's a lot of these these conspiracy theories that literally start out a joke they start out in 4chan and a lot of these chat rooms as trolls and then before you know it it becomes a real thing this is had over a dozen said over and over again and then morons get a hold of but outsmarted true the Reg like he's a smug and did all agree he's a I don't agree what it means you don't think I don't know to do what he's doing listen I don't he's good if you like my no no you would not say he's a dumb person I don't know I'm sorry I don't need to see yes I can't speak particularly yeah he's not stupid I'm very very sad that he said that Sandy Hook isn't real me too but I always enjoy being around that guy you would say he's articulate smart guy right he's a fun guy - yeah so I'm just saying for him - it's not like you can just honey dick him back dude Sandy Hook like it would have to be something no loves conspiracies man you know he really does and this is the problem with someone who like hunts out conspiracies you're gonna love them you're gonna you're gonna look for them you can find any pattern this is the problem is when you have a vested interest in them being real when it's your business because there are a lot of them that are real so the problem is if you have a vested interest in them being real and you exclude information that would point to them not being real and you use confirmation bias and you fuck up and then you try to convince other people that you're correct this is something that people will fall if your conspiracy there's and I'd love to hear you I'm super quiet about all this but if your conspiracy theory which ones have been proven correct that many right there's plenty aren't saying like absolutely there's big ones like Enron you know there's big ones there's big ones you know that there's a many documentaries and books have been written on the the Enron conspiracy these guys got together and they figured out how to make a kill Ian dollars and fuck people over and it was it was it was breaking the law and they knew it was breaking law that conspired to do it and by home sometimes she can take take him there's wise people to think the 2008 hires housing crisis that that was that that was all on purpose and these guys built this bubble up it's not proven though it's it's not proven it's not proved above the housing bubble was they've been great books written on the box well Michael Lewis's book the big shorts a good book on it yeah but you know there there's been a lot of research on that too many banks Eddie is there any proven ones you should earn all this it's all in all the pains Brendon no no no shit it all depends on how much circumstantial evidence makes you throw up some red flags like some people they just don't see the red flags and some people their red flags go up right away so it all depends like when you say is there any proof well you don't need I mean it's at a certain point when you have circumstantial evidence at a certain point it adds you know you know if what you say is pretty suspect JFK suspect is fuck there's no JFK's a perfect example right yeah there's no actual proof of the conspiracy that there was a you know multiple shooters or or the CIA and the mob there's no actual proof but there's a lot of circumstantial evidence it all depends on how much circumstantial evidence do you need for any particular conspiracy theory where you go oh shit there's enough circumstantial evidence like if there was a murder right and you were being accused and only one person said you know I saw Brendan like four blocks away from the restaurant where his friend was killed if just that one person saw that's one piece of circumstantial evidence that's not enough to convict you but of a hundred people said they saw you two blocks away in the parking lot none of it alone none of its standing alone we'll put you in jail but at a certain point enough circumstantial evidence will put dudes and jail or if enough people tell the same story about you with Cosby yeah there's the same story over and over it's like all these women can't be they're all telling the exact same story about the same MO he hasn't too well not only that Cosby had gone to court and had a lawsuit sealed and paid a woman off that's right you had already been yeah so that yeah so this was a part of the whole thing was that he had to come out and you know that they had to defend that in his most recent trade Bill Clinton - I just got down like the watching those Monica Lewinsky tapes yeah Bill Clinton do you know the other problem with like panic but like a son like George it makes a lot of money off his conspiracies and things is that if once he says something I know a pretty good friend is Alex and what the problem is once you say something and you have that big of a following right so let's just say you float out of conspiracy but then you look at evidence you start to realize maybe i overstepped my bounds we all say things we wish we had in there we all say things but now you've got a whole movement behind what you set now to try to pull back would turn that 25% of the whoever it is against you and that could be a liability too so one of the things about being a public figure is you can say something and if you're selling product and selling your Show online you better be all-in you better stay all-in yeah so you become a prisoner to your own kind of first impulse or your own first sort of like matter how an entertainer it's also this rush to say you know something when you don't know it yeah there's a rush to say there's a rush to say we we absolutely know this happen we absolutely know that happen some municipalities get it from somewhere here's the sources choice got what getting rowdy got malt information on these on these you know these tragic events which some like that or you don't think so be looking at Brennan looking I think he has some people controlling the fucking huge worm out show and try not to talk about conspiracy theories but I always get sucked back into them look look ease they're legit questions you're asking super crazy legit questions you're asking someone you know I'm not crazy you know and tell sneakers I'm just saying how do you get there you don't he has his black belt in conspiracy days Brian you know he just never rides and say that there are no black belts and conspiracy theories ouch Jones says hold my beer and was quick all right no you know what the cocks gun where were we yeah what is this huh fail dos Anjos tomorrow Iseman oh that is fight I love this this has been gone for a hot second right it was last week Demian Maia I believing so so and that was a bad one man I did not like the way they pulled him off of mines back that made me a Maya had that he was standing up and wrapped around the referee separated them and I was like what are you doing do you know how hard it is for him to get to that position okay the best cramps are on fucking bland but he's into it he's a really good spot they're both pretty dry draining his energy yeah Paul short Demian Maia what's fucked up man it's like that is fighting okay he's fighting right now just because it's not exciting enough blood blood no they're fighting you fuck this is what they're doing to grant me people that freaked out about it like you gotta just because it's so exciting when it's good they wanted to be exciting all the time but it can't be there's gonna be fights where to fight correctly they have to fight in a way that's not as entertainment it's not as entertaining but it's the right way to fight but you can't so you can't like hardly take the right way exactly you can't not fight the right way just because it's more interesting for people that don't understand what's have a 500 fighters you punish me we should take it's just not the way to fight you never get somehow ever ever or if you do you don't keep it very rare who spawns a beast man super super strong guy like wrestling today no no it's fine dos anjos though that's a great fight it's heavy man that's a heavy fight 70 just became a fucking beef yeah but he didn't look that good against our boy Cole becoming ttan no Colby put on that pressure that put easy things Coby beat his ass but now they announce Colby Woodley of course you have to have that that's the fight I don't Woodley doesn't want to have it because he's probably angry - dude dude I wish I were done Colby Ben Askren you're gonna see angry tyron woodley versus Colby Covington that's gonna be very interesting angry I want to fuck you up Tyron Woodley would they say nightmare think about the fucking guys he's fought recently whether it's Darren tail or Thompson both guys known to be really high-level strikers he dropped both those guys didn't hit him no yeah maybe Maya perfect game plan I wasn't tagged him a few times hit him with some decent shots drop but not rocker and hit he'll hit tyrant fuck he drop Thompson both fights and then Darren till he knocked out well he dumped him he dropped him then he choked him fucking rocked him yeah yeah he dropped drama any darts to remember yes yeah I mean that's right and he I know what was coming it was so weird it's like it probably had been rattled by all those punches and elbows and shit on the ground too and he got dropped by a super clean punch beautiful counter right is that do you know there's of light for them it's like 9 weeks in a row which I'm not mad at at all look at this weird to be to be d TBD teléfono begets the heavy weights the tough heavy weight final I've been watching tough heavyweights it's actually know and a tough woman's featherweight final hmm this is the last tough right back for a second third everything they were thinking it was the last season right well when you say really well Dana said it makes money today says it does real one's watching it I don't know if that's true how dare because of those it's it's hard to tell like when someone just watches something in the moment right like when they have ratings because almost everybody DVR shit now especially when you talk about cable shows is a fact when they're talking about the numbers that they get that shit is voodoo alright if you get a number like say if you put up a YouTube video and it gets a million hits that's a million hits we know for a fact that's a fact that's a million hits we don't know how many people it is cuz some some people will watch it five or six times still a million all that when they're doing like Nielsen ratings shit that's food dude low numbers low now there's also it's love now what they do is because I know this from my show now what they do is they will do Nielsen but then they will look at like three days would you watch it in three days do you watch it seven days you know they have all these different metrics now in the as the metrics still coming from them having to fill out forms or is it something more no it's more technologically based now but it's still not that it's not you know Netflix doesn't tell you shit I find that so strange they don't tell you nothing I don't want to give you the power well just fuck how fucked up is that because if let's say 30 million people watch your special night game an we're just gonna run it back same thing as last year like what because you can really keep going renegotiate and but they're very generous yeah maybe they're very generous I'm telling you they're very generous no I know they paid you well but I pay everybody well when did they start allowing nudity on YouTube is that new or is it rude you sound

er yeah hope yeah but but it pays off in fighting he's got some amazing fights on his highlight reel dude how about how about your first fighting you see this Russian dude I'll see the champ in this Russian organization and then I care you gotta call the UFC cool Who am I fighting Alistair Overeem my god can I see questions warm-up how many times even knocked out a hundred and fifty like that's getting really bad every time it isn't cuz he wins and you know it's the the you know II that heavyweight that guy used to fight we just accept that polish guy right is that Christoph says in ski no it's John Sharma okay sorry he looks like that's Jeff Monson Jasinski had he had fuckin tattoos everywhere still does its white ash shit he's a white guy's Russian bro man he's white white the blends of snow so like when you're looking at over him even though he does look great you compare his looking great to what he looked like when he was ubering dude he looks fucking good though oh yeah a version of Uri Mia yeah but if he like well he used to be a fucking 911 GTS three RS and I was just a regular 911 yeah they're still working it that's cool yeah now he's like a Carrera yeah Targa how old is he now he's getting up there he's 38 yeah he's getting up there guys and he's been fighting forever most skilled heavyweight striking Oh still fuck yeah he's highly skilled highly skilled k1 champ that's what a cowboy Cerrone said that he's like when sparring with him is that such a joy because he's so technical yeah he's so good oh shit watch out for that I mean he's he's one monthly share he's lost a bunch too but he's one of the best strikers to ever fight never man I'm going with Pavlovic on this fight I'm taking my over hurt yeah he's gonna I'm impressed with this drug think you think he's hurt did that his bail no no I mean he got hit but when he's hurt you know it it doesn't take much with a girlfriend cuz he's been hit something yeah put out so many times he's pretty good technician clip there he just he just doesn't take shots as well as he did when he was burying - because of the size of his neck he his neck and his traps he used to have like these built-in shock absorbers all around his head yeah isn't isn't glass just and drum real though where your body shows yeah it's your brain yes from so much trauma just going so soon a CC some trauma that I know we're not doing this anymore it's really nice I asked he needed the body it's your brain not your child she's got some fucking knees man yeah it's definitely the best need especially shadow dude sure hear about that guy that got jumped out here I don't know I don't know how he got knocked out but it was on the news that um he had a severe concussion maybe you know maybe he was in a coma and he wakes up and he's super smart he knows all this like he's a genius my name Brendan just Bryant struck by lightning there Oliver Sacks no no this guy doesn't think not a John Travolta movie the guy who got struck by lightning who became obsessed with piano and became a concert pianist really but down to true story over sack studied it but there's also someone who got fucked either lightning or had a horrible concussion woke up just fluent in Chinese okay so what happens should happen it's one of those things where you hear about it you go wait a minute wait a minute madam though I mean read this story stories are bullshit I think there's some people this I'll definitely get struck by lightning and then also in there good if it's true we find out it turns out that the more you get knocked out the smarter you get that's what happened to me boxing training be right ground it bound and thing about he's gonna work with curtis blade so i'm assuming he's been working this a shitload what i think is really cool is when a mathematician works on a crazy math problem his whole life it has no it bears no relevance to the physical world and a hundred years later they're using it to put a rover on mars yeah it has relevance 100 years later Overeem on top nasty ground-and-pound man dude that just have just hit me I'm a little high do you remember when uh do you remember when of course we don't did you see that fucking missionary the Christian missionary yes that Island it's still a Satan Island he's like no I'm gonna give the word of Jesus I love you and Jesus loves you too any time they're like huh and then killed him instead I think he got shot through the Lord say I think Island is that what you said something like that - no it's Island North Sentinel island they they left Africa 60,000 years ago and they would live it on this island and what's interesting is you say guy I tweeted it on my page there's a guy over and finish him off call this fight so house fuck yeah shout oh it's over powerful I always root for over him now take the holy son that motherfucker still doing it man 38 still doing it right there - one more win and he's a title shot he's always that guy - go for it well he's definitely in the hunt for it I mean look when he fought steep a member when he hurts deep eh yeah it's just as possible that he could've stopped anybody to remember yeah and they're like Joe let's bring that up and yeah well maybe not there well that was when I decided not to interview people that have been ko'd just like it's not fair they have a false memory like oh sure yeah just got knocked out by steep a Miocic dude I wouldn't mind seeing him first Francis Francis again are you crazy son I don't want to see that again I want to see anybody get hit like that again rest in my days what with Satan guy or the Satan Island Oh God so here's what's crazy man they used to be they used to be sort of uncontacted but they got contact in the 1800's by this guy Aleister Crowley now this is a guy on Twitter posted this amazing review of all this stuff is is his name is respectable law on on Twitter so he posted this really long detailed history of what happened to these people and a guy named Maurice Vidal Vidal portman and this guy apparently stayed on the island for a long and people got sick because of these people being there they don't have any viruses they have no well they have no immunity to to what we measured their dick sizes and he measured their balls has he made them posed in all these weird ways like it's really freaky shit but really really interesting he like look at he's measuring the children and stuff like I couldn't window moths and stuff but talked about them like in really weird sexual terms and this guy it was such a bad experience for those people that I thought they were the temple and it was a bike a hundred years ago so when people go back now they immediately kill him so because it's this one dickwad that landed there a hundred years ago they think of white people as evil so these two fishermen fell asleep and I want to say it was like 2006 they fell asleep and their boat drifted onto the island they woke up they just fucking hatching them and arrowed them and kill them on the beach they lived they don't fuck around anymore if you think about is this one asshole if you think about there it's really smart in a fuck that way because if they get and come into contact one of us the entire their entire population could be wiped out yes they don't have immune but they're saying this right no no no no no no no no are you sure homeboy with it no no no we're not saying more America said the North Sentinel island student preacher the last full Satanist Island here's a deal Brendan say don't even say st. is a Western concept just they have no idea this hey white people oh wow Jing is there what they don't like foreign people who's would you I don't know right actor but if they has name up they just they say white people because that one dude came to fuck everything up and then kill them data we don't even know their language so to say they're Satanists is crazy it's like saying that you believe what they're saying that's the rumor how big how big is that island him maybe they have a translator size of Manhattan really no they don't have a translator Eddie they don't even any contact at all the outside world guy was there it's illegal to go that guy got killed and he paid illegally to get it what do they know the fisherman got arrested so there was a cargo ship that ran aground there many years ago see here there is in 1981 and the crew radioed for assistance and then they got 50 men with bows and arrows were showing up tour to try to get to the boat and they helicoptered them away the boat is still there so this is a crazy-ass place it sounds like an awesome movie so I know and then from that from that boat they started getting metal tools because they didn't have metal before that so until the 19 was in 1980 yeah so now these these people took pieces of metal and and cold forged them into weapons and shit like pounded them down with rocks and and created knives and stuff these people are so old-school they're essentially living the same way people lived sixty thousand years ago they've been on this isolated island ever since then to me we should fly over and drop a ton of iPhones everywhere this just amazing there's they don't know how many of them there are anymore but they know their populations are declining so at once at one point in time there was a hundred and fifty plus documented and now they think it might be as low as 39 because these and stuff they don't have in just like in probably bored matter stop fucking you know it's trying to get fish you don't have time to reach kid which one anytime are the central East yeah there's left drastically dropping there's no uh genetic and there's no genetic diversity either it's like I'm sure folks thirty-nine folks is a small number yeah if they're really down to that few and you know they're real real aggressive when anybody comes anywhere near them but the thing is now that we all know about it me I'm I'm a part of the problem too right we're all talking about this now that we all know about it more people are gonna think about going there I think kind of pride here that I say fuck leaving the United States where is that place where worse it's somewhere off of India Bay of Bengal Bay of Bengal it doesn't seem that remote if it's in a Bay it's pretty far well it's far away it's hard to eat it literally it's illegal it's like in the ocean so homeboy who's doing God's work I was like now I can do it and even Ryan his journals like man I hope I don't die if I do my parents don't be mad at me I'm head to this island yeah were you thinking man well he's crazy he's trying to convert people he thinks people need the same language they don't have any idea what he's saying like why he's from Oral Roberts University right yeah see there that's where it is Oh bullshit way out four and a half stars out of five so it's going there's four seasons they have great food it's called human gonna eat you bitch oh okay so they they killed the guy and then they buried him right on the beach man they just dragged his body out to the beach I mean the Indian government said we're not gonna do anything about it there that's all they know well yeah I mean first of all they their law is you can't visit their Island that's their law so he was violating their law him showing up with this book I would imagine they they have laws against people visiting especially whites yeah man that that story that they tell about that one English guy that went there that was Pisa sure fucked up for everybody I hope that guy respectable law on Twitter understands how much I appreciate that that was cool yeah so do you think maybe seals cool you never know they might have some crazy booby traps they might have some vehicles when here was my girlfriend for holiday I loved it she wasn't impressed very poor choice for a romantic getaway great choice for anyone looking to rough it up so silly people are so funny well that Island though is there's got to be people going no I mean fuck no dan Bilzerian is gonna be there next month with a bikini what is it off the coast it's gonna just send a boatload of ape pens and with that I was taking a piss India India India they came from Africa though 60,000 years ago you know flight draws closer to Thailand okay how do they know that uh-huh how would they figure that out if you're not allowed to go on the island that they've been around 60,000 years ago it's good question oh no 8,000 years ago well it's like in Papua New Guinea those tribes have been isolated for for at 40,000 years yeah still yeah not anymore but I mean when Jared Diamond went studied them they'd been isolated for that long they practice weird things too like Widow strangling and all kinds of Spain widow strangling and and that one tribe were you where the young boys suck the cocks of the older men and taking in their ass as well don't it become men so they take in the sperm it's not just some weird if you don't have somebody to compete with those ideas then that gets passed down as religion I gotta piss tell me who wins what I never see break yeah this first first time up there you go go on with your little lilac shirt Francis and Ghana boys I'm excited about this fight which Jack does always yeah it's a big fight for him actually remember he beat him last time but he's coming off that steep a ass-whooping and had the horrible fight against Derek Louis which is like the worst heavyweight fight of all time no one won that fight obviously Derek won that fight to the judges and then Derek goes on to fight for this is foresight since then this is his first fight since their gloss oh I don't like it because obviously he struggles with wrastling so like oh here's Curtis plays the best wrestler in the top five I just don't like it yeah I wish every game someone else who matched up better no matter if he wins or loses I just think it was a great idea is he from Chad where's he from Ghana Chad Rondo yeah come sure I don't shoot man I thought he was from more West I think it's the Congo Jamie yeah yeah Curtis place let's sing Ghana that's a French name so it makes sense he's from the Congo pretty sure Congo falsies gonna Cameroon Cameroon is that where he's from yeah what's his well Cameron's one of the few last places where there's unlike sort of continuous habitat for different animals these companies more to comment but I thought I'll bump up on butter butter butter butter whoo great tune now they're fighting at 3:30 in the morning our time so it's a bit of a time transition time Chris blades just always fights on foreign land when did they get there how many days do you need to adjust this they had Thanksgiving over there so I'm assuming they get why I'm in the UFC flies in on Tuesday like any other fight week right do you want to come early it's hard to get used to sleeping over there I can't imagine yeah I was need to start here can't you just try to take naps and then you can but the Sun set and all that fucks you up if I shut the best way I said they say it's just fast for like 16 hours and then eat like when you get there in the morning eat of breakfast and just get on the spear body gets used to the eating cycle if fastings were they important apparently for oh that's what you did over there right B I try to work yeah I'm still tired you're still thinking of moving to China oh yeah I'm gonna go to Beijing and living in a park yeah are you gonna be a political I'm gonna march in do janya gentlemen's night Australia as the time change fuck me up I was exhausted okay back going there I was fine coming back I was so fucked up yeah in that weird that's going back somehow knows it does to or you know I need to try taking melatonin like when I land like when I when I need to go to bed that night yeah this is how it works I think you helped you know what you know what helps me CBD oil yeah else we're like I think in the morning but especially at night at night with THC or without without the thing that seems to be about reset my system better than anything is a serious fucking workout like show up somewhere and do a serious workout like to push a cardio lift some weights like really get tired and that seems to set me set me I did that in Afghanistan because I was so fun I said I was done well we worked out me and David have worked out like a motherfucker and I did it helped me a lot I feel way better it puts your cycle bounce also afraid the whole time usually on the road wherever I land I worked out yeah when I land I work out I feel better but there's a new scientific my brains crisper like everything's better it's the scientific study I'll find it my phone here please yeah we're we're fasting for 16 hours is the most important thing you can do and then reset the time change right resetting your clock with however they're eating there because that fasting in my work yeah I've heard that you should not eat on planes - I've heard that you're better off just not eating on planes myself a ground plane when you get when you land like your your body will be better off falling into this new time zone when you land if you just don't eat on that another plan you don't eat on planes ever take on his position dude when they come by with that currently at that snack tray they have nice cheese's the fruits and shit Pringles sometimes I just want a banana me too sometime Swedish Fish yeah and Pringles okay a crow oh the sweetest fish in the little cry real ones no no sweets fish on red candies oh you don't you do sometimes if I'm feeling frisky but if I feel like I've earned if I'm coming back from a long freakin couple nights it's a thing I never feel like I earned knows every time he tells I feel bad I don't feel great after I flew first-class to London and they got food and I was cheeses and wines to get hammered no but I just stopped drinking and eating and I just felt like fuck you shit on the plane no I don't think so you felt terrible when you landed oh I was just one big sodium bomb yes I'll have more cheese do you have a wheel back there sure and I'll leave another ice cream sundae I just sag what a little crazy and wine yeah that's what that fuck yeah I finally do good writing on planes though you get some good ideas out because it's just you alone staring at this you're not moving right you're confined to this little seat you're not going anywhere yeah sometimes good ideas come when you sit like that yeah it's so easy to just fuck off when you're at home I know you're writing you just so easy to just get let me see what's in the fridge I'm gonna go grab a cup of coffee I set a timer 23 minutes I don't know why but 23 minutes and then I can't move okay that's good man I think I just you know I just forced myself to do it the thing is what's weird about it is for whatever reason I resist doing it at first like but then once I get into it and I catch a groove I love it it's like getting into a cold bath I could first your skin's like monk and then you're like oh yeah III think everything's that way I think inspiring yourself to kind of get started and then kind of figure out a way to keep even working out though like I did my class this morning that box burn cardio class we start like god dammit why did I come and then halfway through I'm like this is great yeah well you know what man I fuck myself up with that uh sober October Fitness Challenge thing that's a bad idea but this is what fucks you up like afterwards you're like regular work and now it seems boring because everything was this cycling for hours five hours a day you're competing against each other you'd get anxiety like check the app see where everybody scores that shit you know fuck you know you need you can do that you were competing against Bert Kreischer Ari Shaffir and let's take it easy I'm telling you man Broxton Jojo let's jam Haines and that motherfucker's would have no chance let cam Haines at me in that bitch I'm real Fitness yeah I was gonna smooth I'm telling you even if you're doing it the thing is it's about how much time you spend it's not about how hard you worked it down see it's like how much time are you spending at 80 percent of your max heart rate that's really what it said that's yeah watch how fast in Ghana is GZ he's terrifying we should probably watch he's lying on his feet too right yeah oh oh my god oh my god jeez oh my gosh he's just so powerful oh my god oh oh well that's it that's it that's it yeah he's back oh my god starched him Wow you can't that was crazy tad of an early stoppage for me but I don't know looked like it was almost an early stop he was working his way back up nothing I stopped thinking I was gonna say it looked like it was almost an early stoppage and then they let it go on and then it was a decent stop yeah I agree because that's how you save a fighter it seemed like they were gonna stop it yeah yeah he go he got concussed right away he got three chances six years old he's got a lot of fight left in him so just that's how good stop he's just got caught yeah literally just got cut good stop Steve oh yeah I think it was the only way he's gonna lose this fight is getting caught yep god that's fast listen that's the levels of stand up between them you know I mean Kurtis blades is a good stand-up fighter but a really good wrestler is his wrestling stats are like the some of the best in the heavyweight division be better I was a successful team we close the back in the head with that that hammer god boom see like right there look like the ref was about to stop it boom wow so much power he runs over there and look he touches him touched them you're not supposed to touch them everybody just ran into him on accident yeah I don't know man I thought he was gonna stop boom and that Denny decides it that's it that's it that's it that's a dangerous job man super see that clip from the Muay Thai one of the Muay Thai websites has it up there of this referee is stepping in to stop this fight and it needs a head cam I saw a shine right to the dome it's not fuck out well he stayed conscious but he went down we see it moving but he get head kick you imagine me and Curtis blades right now you took that plane for 20 hours to fly over to get knocked down for 45 seconds the worst yeah the war was the possibility wasn't god oh god yeah get friggin in Ghana you're not gonna track I wasn't crazy about the fight for him yeah What did he say about that fight officially which one where he didn't throw any punches he said he carried the fear of his last fight his confidence yeah hmm and this was hurt so you get a shit show you know yeah neither one's fault dick was hurt with his back Francis had no confidence it was crazy I mean it was this the squeakiest of squeaky margins for Derek to win because nothing really happened in the fight yet no-one really won I mean while we were talking about that fight we were like holy shit this is gonna be bombs away that's why I think you'll say it's the worst heavyweight fight because you just thought it was gonna be fucking fireworks I think I might have even said in the commentary there's not a doubt in my mind that this is gonna be crazy yeah but who wouldn't think that that's fair to think with their two fighting styles I didn't know thought it was gonna be kidding so I thought me awesome Derek is gonna be throwing haymakers trying to find his chin I'd like to see him go at it again there is I would love to see that it's Floyd really fighting that one kick box yeah yes yeah you know here have agreed to it's real but it's gonna be a exhibition boxing match it's fake it's a boxing match fake property where big gloves no kicks no kicks at all no no boy too smart for the last two fucking this Japanese just hit okay so we agree kick it - unless unless unless the chooser goes up - that you kidding go hey here fuckin take them kayo we're gonna give you a two million dollars yeah in the middle of the first wrench would be cool to see but they'll rush you through some contract negotiations okay here we go it was weird cuz Floy he was like that was all bullshit I never agreed to any of this than a weak layers like actually we're gonna do it listen man Japanese are they do a different kind of business they're very clever over there you know the UFC got kind of the got kind look when you look at the the sale of pride you know like what happened with all that they did a smart thing a really smart thing one thing they came over and they pretended they were gonna have pride fighters fight in the UFC and UFC fighters frightened pride remember that in the early days like the trust child Adele over there and they were gonna bring fighters over Tamara but they never did yeah no they never did they had to wait till they bought it and then when they bought it they basically just bought a DVD library yep and this felt like 60 million dollars for Pride and when they got it they couldn't even run it so then they had these people that were running the office and these people around the office they just went off and made dream they made their own shit and so they were like sold bayseal logo and I forgot these contracts the contracts weren't even any good like they didn't like a lot of the fighters were not bound to them you know like fate or they did in that fade or they didn't have a lot of things and they owed a lot of guys money and they thought they were gonna operate in Japan like what we're gonna run pride too is what we write that shit now no chance mail but what they did with those smart is the the first thing pride did was they pumped up their own value by bringing their fighters over here and pretending they're fighters gonna fight you Chuck Liddell remember they had that crazy stare down way back in the day but but then they never did you everybody's always talking about but they sent child after pod but after that probably exchange where they did not want pride mentioned on the air know the Hagins rights have not want them their name and how his bells were to say they're fought in Japan the USC also honeydicked the WME when they saw the earth they might look dude we got Ronda we got Brock we got Connor we're doing all this big shit man and then they sold it for four billion dollars I'm like I Ranas gonna retire so we can't do nothing about that proctolin WOD so we'll figure that out well the Ronda thing cause been out for two years a purchase they that was they had already purchased it that was the last Ronda fight the comeback file they'd already purchased to him that's also probably why I was marketed the way it was marketed correct because I legs in but that was one of the what rare times where I publicly was like this is not the deers I'm doing the right thing cuz the Amanda Nunez the champion she's a world champion she stopped Miesha Tate she strangled her like you got to give her a respect he's still not as respect as she should be but that was that was a crazy one other words when I heard she was all run nothing of a man a couple seconds it's like Amanda doing something real quick and that's it like this you're like in the bag but the rest was first ever women's MMA champion that that's a lesbian first-ever UFC girl in the corner yeah who's also accuracy champion so first ever gay UFC champion right yeah and and no one talked that we know of that we know of right I think that's it I think it's we haven't that woman's own made that long for champions well you're saying usually you're saying guy or gal girl so I'm just trying to be funny I started doing about what game happens like who could be gay but Amanda vs. cyborg is super interesting tonight very super interesting to me because uh you know cyborg she's way bigger she's Amanda Kyle Pennington and both their girlfriends fight in the UFC too and are in their corners yeah that's insane come on insane in a bad way but school yeah I mean we've come a long ways yeah it's different it's fascinating to watch JDS came back yeah genius um chef fight fighting they both been out of fucking grip canes coming back here that is that real yeah well mmm nineteen but when did they have a date now just announced he's back in DC posted hey that he said the belts waiting for the champ whoa he's back so what do you guys think of Amanda against cyborg I think Amanda's got a move I think only she have a chance sure she's got a chance she's a beast but oh shit that's a great fight tied to a faucet oh that's right I'm on the fucking fight see but I think only you're a favorite compete cyborg I don't know but there's no girls Wow but like Juwanna Mann it's not happening she's got a chance a man knew that sprite my favorite female fighter - what does she walk around that what do you think Amanda she's probably in the 160s if I had to guess and what do you think cyborg walks around that we went through this is like a tease or something she's down there you know they got man she's bigger she's such an animal she's so much bigger that's gonna be a crazy fight back yeah that's on the same card as uh Gus Van Jones - - yeah yeah hot minute I can't wait for that fight yeah I know right I think the key to to anybody that's gonna be able to beat cyborg is you're gonna have to catch her coming in and having forgot no girls beat inside no girls being cyborgs there's not a girl on this planet that can beat sci-fi ready Mary what about that one dude that turned into a check she'd get fucking dealt with she forgives a copy by a chick yeah she lost her last Fallon Fox Ashlee evans-smith who's in the UFC beat her dated UFC yeah nice cyborg beat both him up at the same time now I mean she's she's such an animal man you seen her spar with like dudes and then that Olympians a shield to the world champion yeah like dude she does not fuck over she doesn't fuck around she's with mr. last fight on a contract - well you know what man I mean I could easily see someone like 1fc grabbing her as well look they're grabbing a lot of people now it's really interesting well sir they grabbing them over there Simon should tape but that's business well they got Eddie Alvarez he just went over there three god Johnson he just went over there and they're looking to expand their roster and I think they're looking to also break into the Western marketplace you know they have that app you can get the app and watch the fights on your phone I've only seen how I sang it I've only seen highlights of one Fc I've never seen you watch it for free yeah Bellator is not doing as well as you have see what they're doing well they're doing weather on the paramount Network they get pretty good ratings are too but they also with Roy McDonald Gegard Mousasi then with the heavy weight with Bader phaidor like the heavyweight tournament was sick yeah they're do you think about Oscar De La Hoya I'm promoting mmm a complete shit show this one do you see the last way dude did you see hey I want to see Chuck and T no no no no not it's not shit Joker's Chuck and Tito do you see us was like you got you got Chuck Liddell's name wrong leaguers and then you have these other guys how did he go check without ID forget it I know I don't lie down everyone used to say Chuck lie down at first that's what you say here knowing that fighters in Hughes it's the first one you give him a little bit of and what else did he say he was and then we you know we have other fights too these guys behind me I don't know their names but you know I'm over their shit no way yes that yeah it's just dead silence he's like you know when you think of MMA when you think of fighters at all you know you just think of these two there's no one else that is the dumbest way to promote a fight it was some guys Oscar's had you know how many professional fights and he snorts all the cocaine does it do all of it watch this press conference he's all and he's like no it's freezing it you know is happening is that a fact no he's admitted he came on there was a dad abuse promise prettiest Oh Devils dander I don't think his love is most Andrew I don't think is love is MMA now his love his boxer yeah it's just you know he's doing this forever you know you know I hope it does well because Tito and Chuck will get benefit the most from it for the piane so I want people to buy because of that right they see hammerstone the game no no you know he was my manager what yeah holy shit you hung out oh yeah damn long talks great dude smart dude what happened why did he get out of Mme cuz it's bullshit you know he was like well I like money fuck this sport well how else is he making money dude he's one of the first investors in Facebook so he's filthy rich yeah oh shit okay he goes ok and I remember he said he goes well there's a demonstration bankrupt and be an MC Hammer bankrupt he was I wasn't like poor see I still ballin yeah yeah he saw it like 12 million dollars it was children yeah smart dude man I'm sure interesting um what were we just talking about before the for MC Hammer Amanda Nunez and Chris no no no that was way long Devil Island if you're white you can't go to the island anymore we're talking about right promoting what I've seen look I hope they all do good we definitely need like more competition more fight there's more fighters than there are fights and the hard thing though is that the UFC is like q-tips right it's like when you think you don't want cotton swabs give me some fucking q-tips they've got the market yeah there's tissue there's a Kleenex for now yeah for now but there's always I don't know if they're it's such a part of the cultural landscape like some people go dude do UFC how fucking dare you but they're there hope that they would get to the point I would hope this is my goal my hope is that a lot of organizations are like a lot of these boxing organizations well you look at like world champions like Deontay Wilder is about to fight Tyson Fury you can have guys that have different promoters and they work together some sort of a deal and then they put together the fights that's better for the fighters if the fights get and the fighters who other organizations get is popular right as you know it's like Manny Pacquiao fighting Floyd Mayweather they had to have these promoters figure out how to put that there for their sport better for everyone because when Ben Askren is whooping a 7 1 FC won't you love if you just fought the champion the earth your belt or champion like Gegard Mousasi fighting Woodley right never fighting I'm 1/8 fighting Whitaker I'd love to see that yeah this is absolute champ they're gonna be very happy that they signed Ben Askren it's gonna be fun he's smart he talks a lot of shit and it took forever to get him over here and a lot of people are in deep shit they're in deep super deep shit he's gonna grab ahold of them and wrestle fuck them to the ground he's not gonna be much they gonna be able to do to a lot of people he's a strong man like you look at that where he goes anywhere the cheering firm that the interviews had a scrum firm yeah look man people have seen interviews online they seen the podcast that I did with them they've seen all of his fights you know if you watch highlight reels you can see all of his fights and I jacked him off every show we get every show and then the UFC Aaron one Fc they allowed him to knee to the head on the ground too you get side control the fuck out of your head he can't man it's a nightmare you can also get north-south north-south needs to the head oh my god yeah mom I yeah fuck somebody up that's one yeah oh fuck I'll say fs1 one Fc oh I know what you meant Fox Sports 1 FC Emmen but to be able to do that to be able to land nice head on the ground like ragdolls giant advantage for a wrestling giant advantage and to take it away from them you like limit like what is really good about being on top what's really good about being on top is you could smash them anywhere it's kind of weird those knees do you hear the rumor about cowboy Connor I did yeah there could be sick fight yeah I think I hope can't we get that fight I think that's a possibility I think that's a money-making fight it makes sense for both guys Connor yeah I know kind of what's that could be rematch but it's like dude let's get one and then go back that way but you got a win really I'm not saying Cowboys an easy fight but it's a better matchup than could be Bertoni and then Tony could be fight it's gonna be interesting to see what kind of shit talking it's cuz cowboy did not have a good time with the shit talking of Nate Diaz you got his hat he doesn't like that shit Tom doesn't like that shit when Connor goes you guys did that you watch ramp it up to 11 until I think cowboy if he grabs ahold of Connor and takes him to the ground Connors in a world of shit - because cowboy is a hell of a wrestler and how about he's a hell of a striker - yeah it's a different it's a different works not an easy fight it's me come on as far as the odds I'm assuming Connor barely be a fail yeah 155 155 yeah look Connors the the speed that he has the 1 shot KO power like Connor can do some shit to motherfuckers and when you see him fight Eddie Alvarez that's when you really realized like Eddie Alvarez is tough as fuck and Connor just put it on him he can starched he can fuck people up I thought cowboy put it on maybe - he did but he didn't do it the same Conor no he did his legs he beat his legs up Connor dis somebody win shots I think that also is a little misleading because I feel like a lot of that was because Connor got into Eddie's head but Eddie's better than that look at that shit that he's been doing along Conor McGregor is a two-to-one favorite that doesn't make any sense to me well it does make sense I was good at wrestler well it's mixed into one his last fight yeah Cowboys have fallen some tough times I love Tapley more anyone in this room will tell he's falling sometimes well he's got the most winning record and UFC history - I believe so I'm also going by that he does one good lately well he looked fantastic yeah against Mike Perry I mean amazing but Mike Pepe isn't far cry from Congress a big different really let me strike what you're saying but look I like the fun'ral fighter I like I'd like to fight a lot and I do agree that if cowboy gets ahold of anybody on the ground he's got crazy ground skills tells me I'm crazy just hold on the Cowboys better off his back if Khan I want to take him down as well you'd be screwed by cowboy in tops not a technician on top no I disagree you seen his technician top top Cowboys on his back cover from his back he's good everywhere yes yes but he'll fuck you up from the top yeah he's got he's got great time most his missions are from his back that's true because he throws a lot of kicks and guys take him down round just a cheap Chavez back out he but he's just he's very underrated as a grappler yeah you saw many reversed Mike Perry fucking amazing fucked his arm up yeah how about my Perry he's not he's he left Jackson's he's like dude I felt like it was you know I didn't want to be part of this yeah you know what came to train and all upset I got put in the middle of this drama he left he's left no longer there oh he looked great too I thought he looked good even you know you office Lee you had the hiccup of taking cowboy down but I thought Perry like pretty fucking good man ya know Perry did look very good he's been looking better and better but he just fucked up until he does that fight was just cowboy had his number cowboy sparred with him who knows how many times Jackson's yeah and the in the grappling apparently cowboy dominated him but I guess Perry said in when in their training camp he was taking so many guys down it's almost like a natural reaction firm egos judged part of the fight took him down they even think about because that's why I was doing camp right and then we killed John goes that was not part of the plan we didn't know what to take cowboy down so where is he gonna go now I don't know I think he was ATT before right yeah I don't know but it for him it men he's getting so much better if he just stays consistent gets with a legit cam mmm-hmm maybe get his ass up to Tristar where a K I like them something about going Montreal sexy mo ki so cold so cold the soloist I've never been yes you're in another country you know you just it's so far you gotta also just really super concentrate on what you're doing because it's all you're doing yeah well I like beautiful city though that's a great city strip clubs in the my environment I love that said and food I can live that allegedly it's amazing I think that could have their like you gotta you gotta be to I think you gotta be with someone of the Wizards there's many great wizards of MMA but to really maximize your potential you got to be with someone who can put it all together you know and you could pick your favorite wizards but one of my favorite wizards for sure is for Ross I think he's like one of the best about Matt Hume who was the best Rufus vacuum does not have very many high-level guys that have been I mean he did work with Maurice though yeah he's in Seattle right yes he's in CAMC pankration but he he was a great fighter himself just great knowledge of the game but what he just but proof of what he did with Mighty Mouse and the way they talked to each other in the corner and he realized like there's a system they're operating under and they're like this is very high level very technical very sophisticated they're staying one step ahead but sometimes outwards for Dimitra C's Demetrius a very cerebral smart fighter so that doesn't necessarily I mean my patience peel plug in and work that's treating my parents do great somewhere like with adjacent Perillo and sandy sure that could be fuckin a dope connection for me yeah or just to find that right coach Alliance San Diego would be great too there's always good spots man but I think that uh having a fresh look is not the worst thing in the world but I think you can't have too many fresh right yeah you got a you put your roots somewhere otherwise you're like where's Frankie Edgar learn his barbecue Edgar Mark Henry yeah phenomenal coach one of the mastermind yeah he's one of the Masters Frank Yeager Eddie Alvarez also owns a pizza place yeah yeah that's my guy that was his that was his pizza place you said it was really good the best he actually tell you actually send me a text after he ate that peach and you go I ate the best because we all talk about Gelinas Pete Seeger's I ate the best pizza in the world bras like well that's a random tax it's a different Pizza I hate to be in that guy but bagels and Pete's are different over there different water they say it's different it's a different moisture in the air dude I've been good on my diet I've been soaking on my diet my special but I've been get off my diet especially you know we just different fastening extra cardio and salmon yeah man I wake up at 6:00 I don't and then I eat quit eating at 6:00 p.m. at night so six six and then I don't eat till usually 10 or 11 a.m. please yes so Wow but anyways anyway so I've been good on my diet but I go to New York next week an artichoke pizza or kings pizza I think it's called King Street I just can't turn it down artichoke pizzas your shit no the companies call Archer a fucking hate artichoke the white pizza at the white sauce now that's not worth shit you don't like that stuff fuck no I gotta have red sauce man yeah that artichoke pizza in New York mouths watering bro some places that have good white pizza I didn't experience good white pizza until I had it at Nicky's in White Plains Russia's pizzeria in White Plains New York raelynne Street right down street from executive billiards they had white pizza that would knock your dick right in the dirt melted butter and garlic on it and ham and shit and you'd be like holy yeah that's what a lot of Italians were in white boy plates I mean hey it's not my favorite now is my castle is White Castle still around Mara White Castle the small burgers one bro pretty sure White Castle for all these comes let's make a vegan burger now White Castle does time which is like that's literally like buying a vitamin from a poison factory that's a bad idea see some vitamins too yeah yeah if you're vegan and like you're buying vegan burgers soy from a company drama crowd erupts millions of animals a year Mozza burger impossible burger you feel better well how about Taco Bell Taco Bell puts essentially sand it while sodium bicarbonate well bro hey no silicone by carbon I think all cylinders so they're so they're they're they're beef filling they're not allowed to call it beef filling they have to call it taco filling because it's not beef the beef has silicon in it to make it fuller and more looking up that shit that shit is delicious would you how would you doubt that why do you how would you near evidence blast [Applause] believe it dude a double decker taco yeah bro no you to blame that's not real its calendar where'd you hear this cows from silica silica right I believe you we're talking about taco by KC it's not in there isolated oat products chili pepper onion processor so come back side anti-caking agent now look that up so Conda yes please an agent how about that oh you guys love tacos hey guys that anti-caking agent to avoid clumping and supplements it's used to prevent the various powdered ingredients from sticking together as many food additives consumers have often often have concerns about dioxide as an additive is it safe that's--and see that that's they put it also frequently found in health food nutritional supplements as an additive sells silicon dioxide primarily functions as an anti-caking agent which prevents ingredients from bonding together but it doesn't say if it's cancerous you eat it every now and then you're beefing carcinogen look at this proven carcinogen well who said a McDonald's answer their buns says suicide is a proven carcinogen wives McDonald's opted to use this in buns potentially hurting human health thanks man silicon is categorized as a trace mineral and which means that it's needed in minimal amounts to maintain health as rats its requirement is very small its recommended daily allowance for silicon has not been specified because it's not food however experts suggest that a daily consumption in the range of 20 to 30 milligrams is needed to stay healthy what about that question I guess just a trace mineral maybe but maybe it is yeah bottles is sailing for sure but you know you know if it has a slimy thing on it here's the thing if they can't really say all this if it's not true if they do they get in deep shit yeah so it might be real that silicon is a trace mineral it's an important part of raw food but it also you're putting dirt and your burgers bro it's also a food food grades so maybe so it's like why is it in there though even if you you're saying it's just Haiti it's okay so it doesn't kick up a filler man 36% beef oh it's only 36% beef and taco 64% is a wide range of fillers and conservatives 36 percent beef 64% is made with fillers and y'all know this though and preserve kind of know that knowledge this 100% beef do you really think it was 64 percent I don't think when I eat them like listen man this isn't gonna be good I'm gonna shit my pants but I love their fucking tostada have you heard that conspiracy theory that McDonald's you know it says 100% beef that that's an actual trademark name mmm beef yeah is that for real I mean making it - no no it was like it was so they know how to be sent beef even though it's 40 percent that's the conspiracy theory I don't know how is McDonald's the same as Taco Bell in terms of like what percentage of it is actually beef yes look at their chicken again the one thing that's really weird is not one thing that's fucked up about the beef that you get in hamburger from the houses those cows can come from ten different parts of the globe so you're eating the set of the cows from China Argentina United States who cares oh it's cattle hills there then it's brought together so so much like one cab bro well I don't give my burgers compromise the no cows name I have two days I'll tell you I think the healthy healthiest thing for you at McDonald's of the mix are true no no no no fish is made from real fish fillet of fish is awesome have you had a McRib those are real ribs things not true I love a fish that larger please I want to fish already well smaller again so it fits the screen there you go whether it's a fascinating premise there is nothing to it McDonald's hamburger patties in the US are made with 100% USDA inspected beef they are cooked to prepare with salt pepper and nothing else no preservatives no fillers all right debunked so nice it's pretty healthy the vault how's that possible that's right at the top of that site what is the title of it are McDonald's hamburgers aren't % BM dude why does Taco Bell get on that train there's like nah fucking they're like fuck it we're talking oh you know it's shitty for you yeah they're way worse than McDonald's then wait McDonald's buys their meat from a company called 100% sure that's not true that's what that's what it's say well that's the conspiracy the whole thing it's false okay so it is but look man you could probably get beef pretty goddamn cheap if you do it that way just grind it all the masses I still like del taco much so all that stuff is so gross but if you go to a real taco spot bro me I will fuck up an Egg McMuffin here's the thing if you get egg McMuffin with ham they really can't fuck with that okay you get that sausage who knows what's in that surgery's no the eggs actually lately they listen they make their what egg McDonald said that they that with in mouth chickens and eggs they use now they don't have I think they don't use antibiotics beaks look at this the containing eggs that are freshly cracked in McDonald's restaurants it's a rest the chains egg items such as scrambled eggs and egg whites are made from liquid eggs but so that's where you go where you go with the regular chicken are you going in regular Egg McMuffins who doesn't get egg on their egg me I fit I'm just gets the sausage patty well the sausage patties just you don't know what you're getting with that no you good thank bacon no

most of them yeah this head this had a special interior like it was beautiful car yeah what I'm saying is it comes no Shrove one if you drove like a 911 an automatic one amazing you would love it I'm sure yeah but then again I really love that test III think my lease is up so the question was I get a Panamera what do I get when's the Lisa March but I can't read in alright well you know there's benefits to both right there's benefits of the electric thing is it's pretty dope it's fast shit yeah off the line there's no gears right it's just like there's no shifting you don't care I like I like pickup you know I like the fact that it parks itself and I like the fact that it drives itself in shitty traffic if I'm in traffic I'll go like that I hit this thing and I just stand there and it just drives in bumper-to-bumper and I never have to touch the wheels when people die with them yeah here you know but you're going slow you don't stop and start that's tiring just knowing ya have your hand the wheel a little bit lightly and just you can read a book know about that drive the goddamn car once you have cars driving for you is the future what the fuck's driver license our way down kids like we owe burrs why would we drive you old fuck that are everywhere yeah driver license getting drivers are super super it's just a little dangerous because those uber drivers weird so we're gonna have driverless ubers and then we're just gonna get in no way you're gonna let a car drive itself like this new Tesla has so many cameras like it just parked for me like the download I went hey guys my buddy goes kid you know this works my buddy Jeff and I go no and he goes watch this and I pushed this park I stood there it parked it parallel parked so fast and well so much better I didn't have to do i sat there and it's red that was like it made me feel like less of a man but you get know just easier oh that's ridiculous hit about lucky but that so sounds like what people probably said when the printing press came out well you're not gonna write your words you're not gonna get apart no no I'm not talking about pride or anything like that I'm you're gonna be driving on the freeway 65 miles well I don't I don't that would make me venturi that makes way more than other people there's somebody accidentally dumbass is their phone a car that I'm in reading hard comic because she didn't know traffic is goes in the middle lane yeah middle lane just stopped dead a woman I work with her mother was killed by distracted driving killed killed her mother they say it's gonna take over drunk driving everything texting and driving to be number some yeah I've every time I see someone driving fucked up I always pull up next to them they're always on their phones always it's like 89 90 percent of the time it's the other is people just make it they should make it so that your phone doesn't work while you're driving right no you don't shop it's an option in the new iPhones there's an option to lock so you locks you out of everything yeah when you take those I'm driving right now will give you a take yeah yeah yeah I mean one of these days it might be mandatory right but you cannot be on your phone while you're driving unfortunately I might take a tragedy that is a do good hands-free system you can do a lot of shit like I can press the little button on my steering wheel and say call Eddie Bravo and it'll call you you could all say text Eddie problem you can reach it'll read text to you to the read text see if you have apple carplay yep but then the problem is you started in rechecks what does that read roll it a read every touches Brian Kelly dick pic yeah yeah would you like to reply no okay it's kind of cool it's kind of weird though it's it's they're gonna have something this is whatever this is this is gonna be nothing compared to whatever they settle on ten years when the fuck are we in flying cars that's never gonna take its place remember your joke about your it's great design you knew you know 2006 500 like 2001 or - nobody else too old but it didn't get on something oh okay today I went from 99 to 2005 does a lot I went oh there was a long gap or I didn't film anything that's where that stuff is from 99 to 2005 yes special yeah why'd you do that to busy that was the fear factor gotcha you weren't grinding with comedy so you know jet packs remember what we're Jeff yeah we were supposed to have those I was doing a lot of spots at the store 30 years I got travelens remembers remember on chips on chimps like 1978 1980 that that jet packs back then and we still haven't mastered it but they're getting pretty good though I have some videos yes I have some cron not here yeah they're getting better now I've seen it I saw a guy in the NFL invest half of his salary into flying cars this was in 2000 oh yeah he's worked out flying cars yeah that's not gonna happen once you've sewn all your money like I'm gonna get ahead of the curve oh just finished just banking on something like that getting off the ground getting approved getting licensed not dropping in the sky infrastructure 1980 we didn't think yeah in 2018 we'd still have cars with rubber tires like engines and basically the same thing yeah so making gas cars illegal by 2020 well what the crazy eating is what are you saying yeah no but they're not gonna release the sarin gas cars yeah you know make him illegal oh dude what about retro cars so do you allowed to keep your car from like 1980 I'm not sure China China in one year decided that there was terrible in one year they basically said that you're going to use natural gas instead of like coal and stuff like muscle from home and I think it was one of us but China has the advantage of school.i all you billion plus people no more and they changed it in a fucking year they just literally just changed the infrastructure so they're they'll be the first ones that as they say but electric yeah all of China yeah look that up with it works of coal plants and shit well they do but but people were using things like coal and gas or of fuel to cook their food to heat their homes and and basically the president said nah natural gas clean burning gas no more less changed it in a year mmm the air is a lot better because the area was pretty bad but they said the air was the worst in Beijing one thing about you see in Beijing is nothing but unfinished buildings they'll build 20 of the same exact looking building in one area and it's so ugly these giant buildings and that's the landscape and they're empty or just cranes and they're not working they day over built a lot why'd they do that they have ghost cities they have huge cities where nobody lives in them because they were essentially saying let's just build as many citizens as we can but they didn't have the population to move them in or the or the economy to support that city it's like North Korea to have a bunch of MD well these creative jobs that also a product of communism versus capitalism because capitalism they would have had to have some sort of financial plan yes and it's a command it's a command economy so so why not just create jobs create jobs if everybody's working just build a bunch of buildings nobody has to live in them but just as long as we got people going and downtown the lights kind of like that they're building the new skyscrapers like all the goddamn - yeah yeah yeah that's the difference the marketplace dictates you have developers to take huge risk and they say I'm gonna build this in the hopes that I can fill that retail space office space yeah China Ned does that the same pressures yeah you know China is an economy of influence too a lot of times you're not doing business unless you've got you know connections with the people that okay your permits etc I mean the arc it's no I'm so lucky we don't live in a dictatorship like that like if you're stuck under the boot of something like North Korea and you're stuck in the band we could could have got a shit roll of the dice of course born and think about it all the time especially cuz I lived in those countries they came right you take a lot of our free for granted but at the same time they're always under threat you know I think from from companies like the fact that so much information is is concentrated in so few companies like Facebook like Google I worried that yes they that's the real issue the real issues that they have they lean politically and they almost should be completely neutral and just allow or not allow things based on whether or not it violates their rules but that's not really the case no and also the way the way campaign finance the way you have to have money it's changing a little but if you don't have money as a politician you better say what your finite do the people that are financing and commit campaigns they'll tell you they'll give you a sheet on what to say if you don't do that you're not in Congress the next time you're around you you you know you you you have to listen to the people that put you there and that's a problem it cost a lot of money to get elected it's just you've got to have very clear rules if you're gonna have rules in terms of like what you can and can't say they have to apply to everyone regardless of race where the regardless of gender or ethnicity and they don't write like one of the things that Brett Weinstein tweeted the other day that i retweeted was some woman who wrote all white people are racist and she just went on this this anti white screed like you just can't say that that's dumb right it's a dumb generalization and it's racist and you don't think it's racist because it's racist against white people but it's racist right it's so stupid that you allow that but you don't allow racism against other rings well what's funny is that they're thinking the same way their methodology is the same as the people they're criticizing yeah so as cram sex it's not what you think it's how you think that makes more of a difference right so you're thinking like a racist I know that you have a different kind of racism but it's still racist well they think it's justified and they're their shitty way of doing the math yeah it's not they're not that smart that's the other things that I notice about it's been sitting there for three hours it's coffee but but the way you get elected and stay elected is you you toe the you toe the like if you're if you want to have sort of an Wall Street legislation certain things so swipe fees swipe fees on your ATM that was that's a huge issue and it doesn't affect a lot of us but it affects a corporation's a banks bottom line and that becomes you better you better vote favorably or you're gonna are you gonna have a problem I think more and more Americans are realizing that money and politics is a big problem it is just how the fuck would you ever get it out I don't know it's always gin that way the question is does your government represent you right right so gerrymandering and how campaigns are financed drives me nuts how quiet EDIUS turn all I'm thinking about distinguished gentlemen remember Eddie Murphy when he became a politician I might not have said that might be the one that I've never seen he wanted to be a politician cuz they found out that damn that's what that's where you make the monster yeah so he well you manage money Latex just like you know just taking bribes all shit but then he gets a conscience then he does the right thing at the end but a congressman spends a US congressman spends between 30 and 70 percent of his time or her time on the phone to people they don't know trying to raise money okay so and you're not allowed to bid on government property so what you do is you go across the street you're sitting in your car you can go across you in the Capitol they're in their car and they're making phone calls they're given a list and you make a phone call and you spend 30 to 70 percent of your time doing that to raise money there's something wrong with that's that's kind of fucked up but whenever I hear people talk too much about politics even myself included my own words I'm like you're talking about like a rigged game it's like you're it's like you're talking about Pro Wrestling yeah yeah it's like you're talking about something that's you're pretending that it's real when but you know what you know you know of course the government is corrupt as fuck but when you're talking about stuff like that like it are the elections rigged or do our votes count the one thing that I learned from this these midterms is that if your vote didn't count and it was an and it's all decided like Pro Wrestling then there wouldn't be all this voter fraud and all these computers that can now when I'm talking to national I'm talking about the way once you're in office the way things get insane is from from the elections you see that your votes do matter yes there's a lot of corruption and fraud going on but if it was all rigged like WWE they wouldn't need to do all that the real system right a lot of people think it's not a real sis right it doesn't matter they already decide and they're just gonna put him in no the way they they actually decide is is they decide who they're gonna rig the machines yes but the votes still count you just got to make sure that there's no you know shenanigans going on the votes right certainly do count but what it would where it gets really squirrely and this is where politics get goofy is in why do politicians do what they do do they do what they do to support the people or do they do what they do because special interest groups of em yeah here's what's really wild so so Capitol Hill when you're in Congress they call that the farm team because in Capitol Hill you spent six years seven years let's just say you're a senator now when you're a senator for I don't know ten years when you're on Capitol Hill fur as a congressman for six for ten years you develop real connections and relationships with government officials who make decisions you also understand how government works you understand who's actually influencing who so now what do you do so let's say you lose an election or let's say you decide I babe I've made my hundred and sixty grand a year can't really live on that money you go to K Street you join a lobbying firm and and because you've been there for six or nine or ten years you know a lot of people and that lobbying firm goes hey we'll pay you a million dollars now and all you got to do is drive to Capitol Hill every day get in there and influence use your connections so that we we can get what we want from government so corporations hiring lobbying firms to lobby for their bottom line so now you're working to influence government and the problem is when you're in Congress you know that you know you have a job waiting if you can make great connections and now Washington becomes an economy of influence that's the game right yes I'm fucking you gotta have a Lawrence Lessig on your goddamn podcast he can explain he's a Harvard professor and that motherfucker you telling me about the podcast you did with him he'll break it down mmm I did yeah listen to that upset I said it to you I think yet Lawrence Lessig he's he's he breaks it down he wrote a book called Republic lost and he's got a couple TED talks about that yes and basically he said your government doesn't represent you and here's why here's how it works when he breaks it down you go yeah it's it's simple the way he breaks it down cuz he's a constitutional scholar out of Harvard when you're like fuck it and what he said was fascinating he said Washington to place where even if you're a good person you must behave in a corrupt manner if you want to survive when good people have to behave correctly yeah yeah the bright side of all that is the fact that there is like people getting suicided and bribery going on that means that there's hope that there's good people inside a government that you got to watch you gotta watch your ass or you know we're gonna we got hire someone for you because we don't want to go to jail so the fact that kill you they can just get you out what I'm saying is the fact that there is all that bribery and and suiciding that means that there's good people in there that are going after the bad people but you know yeah to me I look at the bright side I used to think there was no hope I used to think fuck like when when the bushes were in office Clinton Obama I was like I didn't pay attention to shit I just said they're all corrupt it's all rigged and it's all you know there's nothing you could do about it but um you know over the last couple years you know since Trump got into office now I'm like paying attention like there are some good people trying to do some good shit like trey Gowdy listen to that motherfucker Trey Gowdy's a bad motherfucker what do you turn back gates no politician with these people the congressman Oh Maron there are some great people going after the bad people that's why there needs to be bribes and suiciding and and blackmail the reason there's black males because there's good people in there everybody was bad they would why would you blackmail anybody the problem is it's really subtle the way they can get you out though cuz when your donors are telling you which way to vote you're you as a politician go in there with all your ideas and you can't vote your conscience yeah there's a lot of bad shit you got to show the money you get you're preaching to the choir over here I'm not gonna defend so you fix that so so Lawrence Lessig has one of the ideas he talks about is anonymous donations so so watch you're a politician right I'm a corporation right I give your and I through a super PAC or whatever it might be I give your campaign a lot of money now you're a regular dude you're not corrupt but human beings when somebody gives them a real hand when they needed it you can't help but to feel a little in debt of course what if all what if there are two ideas what if you add a voucher system with all of us were given a certain amount of money every election cycle and we were allowed anonymously to give that money to whoever we thought was a viable candidate it'd be anonymous or what if all donations were anonymous what if you didn't if you couldn't say who it was from but if you know you've got a lot of stuff from GE you know you've got a lot of stuff from Lockheed and there's a bill that comes up for Saudi Arabia to buy a bunch of tanks or whatever or weaponry it's gonna be very hard for you to vote against that and if you do those people that got you in power last time aren't gonna get you in power basically figured out a way to make bribing legal this is Houston take care of you and campaign but then don't exactly tell you what to do right but you know read the book to read is republic lost fucking good is it on audio yes it's amazing again get Lawrence Lessig on your goddamn box alright don't break it there all right well still do relax a little I get excited about it cuz what do you say campaign finance reform is so boring right right the minute I hear that I go like this I've read a book two books on it I'm like oh I get bored I get tired right away but it's so important they've got to figure out some way to stop these giant corporations from influencing politicians they've got to find some way it's got to become illegal there is influence and everybody there's money to be made no matter what yeah the idea is that they want so much so that anything that threatens that money the real true marketplace they want they want to put the fucking brakes to that let's have a kit supposed to cancel each other out though so so ideally is nothing wrong with petitioning your government that's in the Constitution so you can lobby your government it's called petitioning your guide but allowed problems that would be 180 money of your campus isn't lobbying illegal in some countries probably the problem with lobbying it wouldn't be lobbying I think maybe Holland I think I think lobbying because that's what but lobbying the province making lobbying illegal is it's part of free speech that's what it was ruled in the Supreme Court so citizens united so in other words if I want to give money to you you're a politician and I want to I want any bravo to be present right I should be able to exercise my right as a citizen and support you which means you want so I want to amplify your voice that means you need money so to tell me I can't give money the person I like is a restriction of free speech and that I think is I think that was the citizens united Supreme Court knows is another problem the other problem is when subjects like this get brought up and this is one of the most important subjects that we could ever discuss like how our world gets run yes I get bored as fuck I know you get bored as fuck he turns out I understand I don't want it's not mine you don't want to happen but it affects all of us do you want to be like these I'm so into politics ever I'm stable I love it it's like Game of Thrones but it's for real and affects your life it does it's real shit there's real Game of Thrones going on right now and it's so entertaining to find out what the fuck instead of watching a goddamn TV show that does nothing for your life you're right it's really like Game of Thrones really going on right now if you pay attention on season 111 I watch TV shows so that I could just have fun yeah I'm not saying don't do that yeah and that thing don't do that but I don't you can do both those things freak me the fuck out and you can do both you can do both but if you real start paying attention too much the politics and I have a bunch of friends that are really in Nepal especially right never make it so so as far as like not standing out of politics or whatever what if this is where it comes down to we have kids here so now there is a legislative agenda whatever it might be and it's an agenda that says we want to we want to teach your kids something like let's just say because the social scientists in academia wins their way gets into the air politicians which happens all the time and politicians say all schools public schools at least where my kids go are going to teach that there's a zero biological difference or zero difference between men and women oh and by the way ready evolution is a theory and we're gonna put it on the same standings as creationist theory too we know the curriculum ie school board in Kansas I think at one point had that going on there also wait a minute the same each saying the same people that say I'm just saying what happens if you if you stay out of this debate and the wrong people win yet they push their ideas forward which usually have a political agenda you might be faced with a situation where somebody's trying to educate your kid kid in things that you just know I disagree with it's actually incorrect so that this happens this is where it starts getting personal yeah it can get real weird like there was this thing from nature the other day that i retweeted because Brett Weinstein Weinstein had brought it up and he was like this is really disturbing that these people are making this distinction it was talking about the difference between biological sex and unreal there's I don't want to misquote it so I'll find out the exact thing but there's essentially promoting social justice principles over scientific principles and it's supposed to be a company that specializes in science right so instead of just being scientific there's scientific with a very clear progressive political twist to it right and you're like well just because something's inconvenient doesn't mean it's incorrect just because something's on comfortable doesn't mean it's not true right and there's things that you might have your own personal beliefs and values and ethics but that's not what we're counting on when you're a science journal we're counting on just facts that's it and they're not doing that did you see the I think you're two thing to say this proposal has no foundation in science is nonsense the genitals so this is what it is like go to the pull up the nature one first I could read that the US editorial the US Department of Health and Human Services proposes to establish a legal definition of whether someone is male or female based on the genitals they are born with this proposal has no foundation in science and should be abandoned and this is the journal Nature so the problem with that is what brett weinstein very succinctly bub says like to say in quotes this proposal has no foundation in science which is what they said he says is nonsense right the genitals wanted one is born with show overwhelming correlation with one self-assess gender as predicted by evolutionary theory if we grant nature's claim we condemn the study of complex phenomena to a darky God's example and nature should know better but they have a political agenda where'd that come from they were influenced by strong forces probably on the radical left in this in this instance there are other sports on the other side that's where the wind is going and if you support that you get way more love than you get hate right there's currency to it you lick your finger you express like where the winds going like to say that there's no correlation is fucking bananas we're all men and that's controversial but it's controversial to say it well just a lot of nonsense going on right now that I think will eventually be sorted out once the dust settles but I think this is just a wave of information it goes left it goes right everybody's battling it out and because people are more concerned with their side winning than they are with actual facts right a lot of really stupid ideas get supported and instead of objectively analyzed for whether or not they contain just push back with kids though so my buddy my buddy's son is 15 and he was like it's all about gender and and you know educating you on gender in high school people choose their pronouns so when you're in college my nephew who's in college whether with the 18 years old they said let's say your name and please tell us what pronoun you would like to be referred to us yes right at first first day or so so now the kids now the kids now the kids though as they're being taught this by their fucking teachers because they're kids they're like the fuck out of here so my friend goes look at that look at that look at that butterfly isn't he beautiful and his son goes dad do you have any idea how hurtful it is to that butterfly you have no idea where that butterfly's gender is and they're all fucking around that so if there's pushback on that shit well there's some really influenced people easily influenced people that are adopting all this course whatever so that it wasn't we're growing of course even it especially that way indoctrination is the right word yes you could get kids to believe in anything I use some I am Kayla and my son too I say you know when I'm gonna make him a Cleveland Browns fan we flew to Cleveland doctor Cleveland Browns and all he wanted was a Baker Mayfield Jersey that's he wants to be like dad like fucking work Cleveland Browns on one trip he's it's hard though to keep a theory going that doesn't really have any basis in science at the end of the day it's it's kind of bangs gonna fizzle I don't think they're very smart on well in their political and they don't think they're very smart I don't think there's scholarship there's deep men women people born as men but think they're women people born as women think they're man I think people that think they're both that's five it's very rare and then they said there's like 60 of them are 78 different gender pronouns but that's because no one has agreed on what the gender pronoun should be so if you decide that yours is Cir and I said no mine is zyr II like explained there people that want to be special this is a big part on everyone you got to go to people wanna be something out of you're a guy come on what if we gotta take courses I know you think you're God but we're gonna you're gonna you know it's a very sure you know what Sam Harris said that I fuckin loved he said right now the one thing to keep in mind is that being a fan is not an argument and it's not a virtue so you can't just shut the conversation down because you're offended and you're taking issue with what I say that ain't an argument and it sure is fucking a virtue but that's what's going on when what's-her-name Heather McDonald's that her name's she was speaking at she was speaking at a college and there was a law student he was just giving it a finger the whole time and all she was trying to do is talk about you know something that was based in science and Heather McDonald what's really you know she's a she's a professor a journalist a professor of journalism I think and she's a very reasonable kind of like clear I can't does it matter man people are struggling so hard to find things to be offended at that they're pointing at targets that aren't viable and they they're throwing all their weight into it and then what doesn't work they back out and they try someone new that's right you know Christina Hoff Sommers you were some of the things that she did where she was trying to speak and they were shouting her down and making all this noise in the crowd they're trying to boo or off the stage they just trying to silence people because it's something that you can do you can't get it done because they're afraid of their ideas they don't think they're afraid of a game it's a game to do here comes one side she's on the other they wrote for the Browns she's with the Raiders right that's what it is my team's it's a hundred percent wages what are your feelings on the caravan situation what do you guys think about that from all the people that are getting in here every day like what is it but it's a fault it's a fake thing we're supposed to be paying what exactly happen with the caravan so they're making a big publicity event out of these people that want to come to America well they they came together they want a Cylon so ms-13 and the gang are the big employers there you don't join them you get your family nice guys and I think that these people are desperate they're essentially refugees from a place that's intolerable but they're making it this really big political deal yeah it's very publicized totally and apparently they're always walking like sometimes they get in the vans and people drive in place you say let them in I don't know what you'd say that we shouldn't let him in or we should without them and this is what I'm saying you say that's the issue well yeah we definitely don't people don't want too many illegal immigrants but what's interesting to me is like if you come from Q but you could just come yeah if you get on a boat and you get over here in America but like you made it bro come on in yeah if you tried from Guatemala like nah sorry son wrong patch of dirt find another don't take our beam right because yeah but it's it's for horrible murders in New York last made an agreement that anybody who's trying to escape the kind of shitty situation they have in Cuba will allow that right oh I got to Colombia I mean if you if you're Yoel Romero and you come over from Cuba yes you look like that's true you cuz you're communist Reyes will take you people think that like all Mexicans are like for the caravan and too you know we want them you know that's not sure now most Mexicans are in another country you ain't getting our welfare yeah you know to me Mexicans ain't down for it for that Caravan they want them turned away too it's a complicated emotional issue man it's like I always do this joke where I believe in borders but I'd be a shitty border control agent right like I do think borders are reasonable by nobody gets over and then I'd be like the kids fuck it come on I think Americans feel that way at that you know it's a it's a hard do you live in a gated community no okay I mean yes all right no it is a it's like the idea that there's a real country that there's a place where you can go in a place where you can go and like you have to have papers and it make me across this line the dirt like they've set up fences and borders well the she needs reason that exists right I mean if you think about the United States right the United States essentially is not just a country it's a collection of different areas right in each different area has its own culture their own almost their own language you know the way they talk and Florida is way fucking different the way they talk in Maine it's really weird it's all the same language but it's almost like there's separate little countries and we travel amongst each other no problem and you're allowed to you love to bail out I'm gonna try to Vegas for a while I'm gonna get me a job at a casino nobody cares like you're fine as long as you're honest one patch of dirt but the reason why we don't allow all the other patches of dirt to do the same thing and everybody just flow freely is because there's some spots that just don't have it good at all and we want those people to stay there all fuck you haven't thought although your spot you haven't fixed you know what the connected extra spot but you know what the connective tissue is for Americans besides they even though that's true the connective tissue that I think a lot of countries don't have is that the one thing we have gone for even if it's even if it's a myth for a lot of people the one thing all Americans have gone for MS is no is the idea that there's a chance if I do the right thing I may be poor now American it could be a fucking millionaire yeah shit is so and but that's what keeps the sort of that's what is coming from from creating a revolution yeah but if we lose that like you can't let everybody can let everybody in from Kentucky if everybody from Kentucky decided to move to LA we would just have to deal with it it's American they got citizenship that's what I'm saying yeah like it's not the reason why we can't have world citizens dogs to some places suck too hard you know our nationalism I'm not saying that it's good or bad I'm just looking at it as a thing right now if I had to say do I like it honestly I think the whole world as the human beings as a race would be way better off if everybody could move where it's good and then we would figure out why there's too many people where it's good and then they'll settle down and you move to a better spot and then eventually even out yeah you know the reason whatever happened but we never even the reason why in segregated areas don't advance like these people in Sentinel island it's a kind of a fucked up example Satan's Island they're saying going anywhere like this is they're wearing leaves over their dead right but they like them for six do they but but do European humans would by the way you and I are morons okay if we were living on that island we would be having leaves over our dick too yeah it's not like oh I'm just gonna invent a satellite these fucking morons like we don't know how to do any of that stuff yeah so we would be with them just with a greater understanding of what's possible you just say Bohr around though what you just said is happening in the European Union I mean that's why a lot of Polish people come under the you can and they come back and you know well there's and there's also what they're doing now with immigration is freaking a lot of people out because they're allowing so many people of different cultures to come in and then their cities become more multicultural than they are English and then it gets real weird but yeah the other problem is that when you have currency currencies used to be based on the productivity of their citizenry right so when you have currency everybody has the same currency which means it's all value the same thing problem is that people in Spain are not as productive as people in Germany for example so the German goods and services should be worth more or the dollar there that the euro there should be worth more than it is say in you know space isn't it better when the state has more power than the Fed well that's like countries is that better that's basically because the argument is is we're like a band of countries a country not better you know when isn't it better for the people so then that would mean you know at the same rate you know it's better to have a country like the United States than to be socialized with States you can go to any state yeah with country yeah you know you can try getting in Japan I mean Japan I mean yeah you can't get in there I think or something would you say the Japanese took like 10 Syrians try getting into Canada these were harder than these days ever they're very liberal no cameras out your peace to live in because these the celebrities like I'm so sick yeah but his ways I'm headed to Canada do you have a DUI I'll let you win it's true it's a peace no I'm gonna be that's crazy boys let's wrap this bitch let's wrap this up it's a 320 we watched a couple of fights I feel like I'm in New York next
