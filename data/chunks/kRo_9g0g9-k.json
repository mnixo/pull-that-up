we're here ladies and gentlemen the party's already started we're drinking something that my friend Ben O'Brien invented it's called an rye brain it's a whiskey and alpha brain and it's delicious in the Yeti tumbler yeah Cheers my brother good to see you buddy yeah it's been a while you live in the good life hey I'm still kicking you know it's another good day I'm still vertical yeah but you live in the good life man you'll you're out doing what I want to do you're out there and the great state of Montana did escaped I landed on Saturday and yeah I lived in San Diego for I think almost 10 years love San Diego no complaints about California it's beautiful the beaches there's mountains all that stuff I love it landed San Diego got in the rental car was going out to skydive and couldn't even see the mountains out by where I've been a good jump because it's all hazy & smokey and it took me longer to get out of the parking lot than it does to like get back to my house go shoot the bow in the backyard go do a workout I was still in the San Diego International parking lot so I can't wait to go back yeah there's good and bad you know there's good things about the big city life you know you get a lot of great restaurants a lot of cool but you've already done that you know we moved to a town and has 22,000 people Wow from a subdivision of San Diego that 260,000 people and I honestly my only regret is that it took us so long to pull the trigger on doing it it is unbelievable and have you done the winter yeah that there yet winter's coming yeah winter last year we were there for the whole month of December there was a few days it was negative ten okay which I found if you stand close enough to the fire it feels just fine yeah man just wear a nice thick like a real good jacket you know we're good wool undergarments I know you could be all right I know some people who work in the industry of to make the cold weather gear just from my old job and they send me some stuff so it's really not that bad and there's some things in life that I will spend good money on cold-weather gear rain gear just pony up and pay to extra money because it's Kihei all for you in the end yeah I get some real  my friend Tony lives in Columbus Ohio and he he the way he put it he goes like look here's the deal he goes you can't really dress for hot weather he goes but you could dress for cold weather yo she wear warm clothes and cold weather you're fine he goes but when it's hot out it's just hot out you got to go indoors or you can nude up but then once you get to that level you're done but it's like Ellie has know whether it gets it gets hot and that's it it rarely rains if it rains 20 days a year it's crazy nobody knows what to do inside I'm not gonna lie I was I was laughing and very happy when you were posting it but I was like 105 106 and up we live is like 60 beautiful bluebird skies a little bit of a breeze yeah but you get sick nighttime starving looking to write look what's the star gazing up there I mean it's not hard to get out of that light pollution you drive you know we were fortunate we have probably the reason we moved up there as we bought an investment property in 2016 and it's in the middle of nowhere like probably 15 miles out and you want to talk about no light pollution the ability just to look up and it doesn't look anything unless you've experienced that you can't describe how much you're missing out if you live in a city yeah looking up it's unbelievable yeah it's weird right it's one of the weirdest things about civilization then we've chosen to do that I know that a lot of there's there's a lot of talk about people having like nights or like one time of the year where everybody shuts their lights off and they have like a just a viewing of the stars are gonna no light night who's talking about that before online of heard people the organizing light pollution observance day or some  yeah I've heard some crazy things online I try to try to avoid most of the things that I hear about online gatherings that start on life I'm know a picture that I put of you with your flying squirrel suit flying over the earth I purposely chose it because you can see the curvature of the earth in the background or can you based on the comments bro it's a few islands bro was that shot with the fisheye lens whatever the GoPro comes with yeah it's probably Islands it's got a little bit of a curvature to it is okay there you go I love that suit I was jump in that suit on Saturday is there some interesting comments in there the Internet is a very interesting environment that has no consequences and allows people to interact in a way they never would if they were sitting across like we are right now yeah and it also requires discipline in that regard like the way people communicate with people it just there's no discipline and in terms of like conserve like just think about what you're gonna say think about if a person was in front of you think about how it's gonna affect that person and then proceed nobody does that there's none of that there's it's not I wouldn't say nobody does that but it's few and far between ocon secuence --is especially if you're an anonymous person just regular job like yeah you got a nagging it's like dick six nine five to whatever your name is do you just feel like talking I mean I understand it if you if you put a quarter-inch piece of glass in between me and another driver on the road I've been known to say some interesting things that I wouldn't say to somebody in like a line at Starbucks if they bumped into me do you know what that's from though what they say the scientists have kind of studied the human response to critical situations where you're you have to make split-second maneuvers like high-stress situations you don't think of a car as being a high-stress situation but when you're going 70 miles an hour and every little thing is like you're you're way more tuned in than you think you are so anything that happens like this about the like you're you're way more ramped up that's where road rage comes from it comes from the fact that your brain is very aware that you're going to have to make split-second decisions so even though they don't realize it you're at seven all the time you're like ready to flip to eleven when a gonna kill you yeah I mean I've seen people just lose their  and and by the way here's the really crazy thing I've seen people lose their and if if it ever physically escalated like they did pull over they got out of the car I've seen helpless yeah he'd be helpless they don't know how I've been with people like listen man you don't know how to fight at all what are you doing you're starting a fight yeah that's crazy don't do that you're starting a fight and you're praying to God or whatever you believe in that this person doesn't actually follow you or pull over yeah they're in a car version of the egg on Twitter they just assume like you you're never gonna see me again and this isn't real you piece of  but sometimes it is real you know I've seen people duking it out on the side of the road yeah yeah and it's it's pretty ugly it doesn't go well for both parties generally a buddy of mine from jujitsu pulled over to the side of the road with a guy once and they started do clean out and they both knew how to fight and it was crazy they were hitting doubles and sprawling the other guy goes for a Darce he reverses him he gets side control needs him in the body the guy  hits him at triangle they  he passes the guard like the whole thing go back and forth on median on the grass they were on the grass on the side of the road and then when it's they're both exhausted they high-fived each other and then got back in their car they were laughing they like you know how to fight man like both actually they both drugged I'm gonna  this dude up I'm gonna this dude up and then they both were not just not just did they both know how to fight they were both it like a purple belt level little impromptu grappling session a car and punches and kicks and the whole deal but they both actually knew how to fight it was pretty funny the way he was telling it was pretty hilarious I mean I mean I can't I can't why I get I get excited when I see people upset in their cars like if I cut them off off accidentally and I see them getting pissed like the foot just slowly rolls off a gas yeah they get really close and I'm doing 40 on the freeway and I don't know I mean I don't know my problem is probably just an asshole but is the more upset they get the more warmth I feel in my soul as I'm going down the road watching them lose their in their car well don't you think that a guy like you who's been through so much actual real combat probably relishes a little elevation of the the normal day-to-day life just a little turn that bitch up a little bit let's come on just crank it up a little bit I'm probably the last person that would ever fight like I just and I bet you it's the same with the UFC guys right who make their living in that insane octagon like you think some of the things I do are a little bit atypical I think people who live in the Octagon are absolutely out of their mind but I bet you flew 18 miles in a squirrel suit the suit did most of the work man the  the all this that can go wrong what did you say what the temperature was when you jumped out 50 below zero 50 below with the windchill and I was rocking a t-shirt I'm not smart I couldn't feel my hands I had hand warmers the chemical you know the ones that you crack open and just for like skiing but I didn't I didn't open the bag until 20,000 feet you know didn't really think that through it needs oxygen open the bag while you flying like that no up on the way up is an hour flight to altitude and I knew was gonna be cold so I opened up the things and I put them on my hands and put my gloves on and said I'm like why am I not feeling these heat up and then I realized that they need oxygen for the chemical reaction so I jumped out and I probably halfway down I couldn't feel my hands so I just had them like tucked up behind the wing and I know where the little small parachute is that you have to pull to deploy your parachute and like all right be alright I know where this is I've done this before pulled the parachute and I get on the ground and then my hands started burning because the chemicals started reacting so I went from freezing cold hand to feeling like I had my hands dipped into lava so I couldn't get the gloves off also probably a little hypothermia right probably say when they found a guy recently in I want to say Oregon or Idaho I don't know one of them cold places and he went elk hunting and they they couldn't find him he got lost and when they found him he was dead and he was only like a couple hundred yards from his truck and they think he got snowed out and couldn't see where he was going and he had taken his jacket off he'd taken his gloves and his hat off and they say that's one of the signs of hypothermia is you slaughter people naked a lot of the time they take all your fork yeah they just start you know you get hot - apparently it's not just euphoria the if you get hot or ya or Washington State that's it is yeah missing elk hunter recovered in Washington I had heard about another guy who died in Oregon who was a he was a tech guy he used to be on this tech show that I used to watch and he would review like gadgets this was like early 2000s and he went up with his family and they didn't have a car that can handle like serious snow and they got stuck and they were there for nine days with no food and he went walking off to get help and froze to death and his family was eventually rescued how far did he make ID I don't think he made it very far I mean he wasn't wearing the right clothes you're doing regular clothes you know and he just he was just desperate and he was trying to save his family and it's just so sad because I'd seen that guy on TV it was so weird because you see a guy on TV we're reviewing gadgets like here's the latest laptop like look at the here's the Ethernet port and what we've got here is a you know the bubble bubble-butt and all this different stuff a review like the most technical of technical things and in terms of like the highest level of electronic achievement so far right like the newest gadgets that people love like like the when you think about society and civilization you think about those things and meanwhile the guy froze to death in the forest like the real life all the tech in the world isn't gonna save you if you get out into the wild if you rely on something that has batteries for your sustainment of your life you're gonna be in trouble at some point yeah you got to have baseline skills yeah they say that like when people go to the forest people are afraid of grizzly bears and all sorts of different things but hypothermia kills more people than anything yeah doesn't surprise me it's slow to I mean that's the insidious onset of you know your feet get a little bit cold and from what I've I've talked to some guys who work like up in Alaska right where's McKinley I think McKinley is in Alaska wherever McKinley is and it's not uncommon for them to find people basically missing but they're naked because it's that slow the thought process degrades I'm sweating and take my jacket off and they just lay down and go to sleep like it's just that 1% at a time until you're basically a popsicle and doesn't your brain pump morphine or some equivalent to morphine through your body when you're like near death I think when you're in like severe pain or near death everything this makes something I think you just go into shock yeah yeah I don't know the the physical process of what happens when you go into shock but I've seen some people that are in a lot of pain and they would have liked to have their brain pumping some morphine yeah and wasn't happening maybe they weren't pumped enough perhaps yeah just I'd read something about that that there were there was someone was trying to explain near-death experiences and like why when people have near-death experiences they have all these freaky visions and some of it they think could be connected to psychedelic chemicals that your brain produces mmm which are that they definitely know that's true but I think there was also some talk about some morphine like substance that your brain makes I wouldn't surprise me if your body recognized it was on the downhill slide little bit a little yeah just like this dude doesn't need to keep screaming yeah probably probably just a protection mechanism if anything yeah well when you're out there man I think one of the cool things about being in the wilderness is that most people most people just never experience that for long stretches and when you do get to experience it it gives you sort of a like oh I always thought the world was this I always thought the world I was Phoenix Arizona where they drive down the street and you go to see your friend and yet on the car and you go to the movies and there's a restaurant and then you go to Montana you go wandering through the forest you see deer and bears and and you see the mountains and the quiet and your cellphone doesn't work and you're like oh yeah this is the actual world I have found that it's that in that people and including myself think that I am this and then you go out into that environment where you're detached and then you have to rely upon yourself and your knowledge and your grit or your fortitude and you kind of figure out more of who you are as well - I don't think people really you don't figure out who you are if you live in the Greater Los Angeles area do you know who you are in LA Sanja correct but I don't think you are in Los Angeles's who you really are I don't think so either you think you get to go out and outside of that and either rely on yourself or maybe even more importantly rely on somebody else and have that dynamic outside of communion you couldn't I guess you could starve to death obviously or you know not have enough water but the places to get those things in LA you could solve in a block in either direction yeah go far enough out in the woods and you're on your own and to me that's where you find out who you are I do I like being out there because I get to think about me a lot yeah I think that's a really good point that you're not like you think you are who you are you think you know yourself but you know yourself in the environments that you know correct the way you really find out who you are is to experience a lot of different environments and a lot of different difficult things like you don't really know someone until you see them tired til you see them exhausted and hungry yeah yeah yeah well the Jon Dudley's always had that about hunting like you think you know a guy take him hunting his litmus test his hunting camp yeah I believe he says you'll either be friends for life or I'm never gonna want to spend another moment with you yeah it's pretty accurate yes you come off the rails people I don't want to get up at 5:00 in the morning I just went to bed at 11:00 all right well you're not on the invite list for next year you're missing out on this thing we're doing you know you can go hunt that PB&J in the refrigerator there's a line where you got to learn though like there's a line we're like okay we could die today this is not we should we should really be careful if we go out today you know this is this is not the right like my friend Adam Greentree do you know Adam you gotta meet him if you don't first off I don't know him but I definitely follow him yeah yeah that skirts the line that's his water buffalo up there by the way right above Old Glory nice awesome is that your elk from yeah is that one is that's from Tejon ranch yeah but Adam he crosses that line he gets to the edge pushes that one that's how I would describe it he goes out by himself a month at a time nothing but a tent runs out of water all the time drinks funky water coming out he's got that weird brilliant gut though we could just drink water and like get some microbes going on there whatever he's eaten in his life it's like it's festering inside of his body kills off everything else he doesn't get sick the guy drinks out of creeks all the times he's probably always just sick and that's his normal maybe is sick it's happy though yeah but he he gets close like he gets close to that edge like that do you ever see that would you watch the Instagram story when the grizzly bear came charging him and he's filmed at all for Instagram yeah but he's also got an unloaded gun I was very upset with it it was loaded but he had never shot it so the battery no the bullets were the wrong size for that gun so you can barely see the top of the gun I'm looking at it you can see the barrel at the angle so the slide is back in like your your toe your oh yeah like you're pointing your finger at a bear had a bear you're gonna pull on that as it each your face he said the bear ran to ten yards No thank you old clip 10 yards pass false charge ten yards he said when you see it running and you see the muscles rippling under the hair and the hair and the snow and imaginers right and on the ways of that claw ripping through the ground no thank you and it's huge you know he said it was like a 9-foot bear and if so if he I mean obviously he's got a ton of interactions with animals in the wild but if he had run instead of standing his ground he'd been it would have attacked him right 100% oh yeah he would've been  you can't because they just have an instinct it would just take you out it's like you're weak you're moving away not only you not a threat now now the bear has the opportunity to close the distance and the Bears don't exactly know what the you are they don't exactly know what the a person is they might have seen a person a few times before but they don't eat a person and they don't a person the problem is when a bear does eat a person once a bear eats a person like oh I could just eat people delicious like a bear chases an elk like it's all it's kind of a hustle there's a lot a lot of running I can't imagine a bear catching an elk well they catch them do these crazy video but they're eating a moose he's chasing this moose it's a big  bear and he's chasing him around a circle in there it looks like they're filling it from a helicopter and the bear is just this this moose is haulin ass see if you can find that Jamie bear the  up thing is when bears catch you they just eat you they don't kill you first they just start they just start eating just like they do a salmon how they grab a salmon and just bite into a hole it apart they do that to your guts see that's where I'm really hoping that morphine thing from your brain is true can you imagine looking up and seeing your lower torso inside of the mouth of a massive that's what's so scary do you ever see the movie Grizzly Man no how dare you how dare you miss out on the great intentional comedy in the history watch it tonight it's great you wanna talk we were talking about this before the show but people who are gay who don't want to admit they're gay run that's this guy and he decided to go live with the grizzly bears to protect them in the forest he got eaten I think I know this story okay now but it's a Werner Herzog film okay I don't know if Werner Herzog was trying to make it funny but and I mean maybe it's just funny babies no it's it's funny but it's funny to me because I have this crazy appreciation for wildlife and respect for it and I there's part of me that like like Stephen L had a funny way of talking about this guy he goes hey you say all you want about that guy goes that guy was a hard camper he goes that guy did some hard camping he was out there for six months at a time Mike yeah gotta get back to really did live we have two bears for six months at a time but wearing hers like the way he filmed it he filmed like the way he would have people talking about the guy like they go to a sheriff and the sheriff's like I thought he was retarded just really digging into that character and plot development yeah the guy I mean it's just he shows you this guy's ex-girlfriend who's crazy and they're talking about his life and they interview one of his past roommates or some guy who knew him in LA and he's talking about how crazy he is and how he kind of made up a past for him selphie was just like this really had like fake accents that he would use sometimes this is a really bizarre character who found his identity in taking care air quotes taking care of these bears that didn't he'd taken care of and he was going to protect these bears and you know these bears just they didn't give a about him we I don't think they wanted his protection oh it was amazing it's amazing and anyway the film of him getting eaten he it was filming bears had the cover on the camera but the audio ran and the audio ran for seven minutes by the way if you look you try to find that audio online it's not there but there's some fake audio online that people attribute to it but if you listen to it with a discerning year and you tell those people aren't really screaming it's fake screaming but it was seven minutes long of the bear eating him and his girlfriend his girlfriend hit though here ate his girlfriend yeah the bear was eating him and the girlfriend hit the bear in the head with a frying pan didn't do jack the bear tears her apart you know I'm not gonna lie it more surprised that he had a girlfriend wasn't really a girlfriend it was a girl that was a friend I thought she was your friend two worlds two words yeah I've had friends that are gay that have wives and these poor wives they walk around looking like this all day long like there's like like what's wrong this guy doesn't me like man there's a lot of poor bastards out there that are just deep in the closet and they don't that's not cool when we at that point now where you can just kind of do and be I wish we were I wish we were I know a couple guys that are deep deep in the only say I like how do I talk to them I talked to them in brief brief chunks cuz I'm I I get this feeling from them where I'm talking to them where they just want to end the conversation before I go hey man are you gay like so every conversation is like this really quick really quick really quick hey you could see alright hey take it easy man see you next time hold on hey before you go are you gay are you guys it's just it's a Bomberman it's a bummer yeah I mean to get to get to 2017 and not have that worked out seems to me to be a travesty though the fact that people give a yeah why does anybody care what other choices that they make in their life well my theory has been there's two types of people that care about gay marriage and that is people who are really dumb or people that are secretly worried that dicks are delicious I can get behind that campaign that's my theory that was one of my old bits and I think that when you know there's a lot of it there people are afraid that other people gonna think they're gay a lot of it is people that grew up where they hear terrible things about gay people or prejudice people around them tell them crazy things about gay people they don't realize that gay people are just people that like guys that's it and there's other guys that like guys too and if everything was open they wouldn't feel so creepy they'd feel creepy because they'd have to hide it and be secretive and always be yeah like it's forbidden they're there yeah so that's where the weirdness comes from but if you go to Santa Monica Boulevard there's these there's this area of like three blocks in West Hollywood and Santa Monica Boulevard that I don't get out of my car it's not worth it you're just loading the scenario up I'm already thinking my head like I'm never going here you ever go to wild animal parks where you stay in the car and the monkeys jump on your car and rip your windshield wipers off no yeah yeah yeah the monkeys jump on your car I don't know if they have them anymore but they used to we used to be there and you know you'd have to like agree that the monkey might your car get signed a waiver when you get in like don't go there with a Ferrari deliver the car that could get jacked because these monkeys might Jack your car but you would be around these animals and you'd stay in your vehicle the entire time they have one in China and it's a great story about a year ago this lady was in an argument with her boyfriend she's like you and she got out of the car and and she went around the car and she was yelling at him and a tiger came you posted it I saw that and just yanked her away and then Tyger and then someone else chased after her and apparently she lived but her mom died her mom's going out trying to save her save her from the tiger and the tiger killed her mom it's dumb bitch just thought she was she's like I have it in my head I'm gonna say what I want and I'm gonna get out of this car  you and she gets out of her car and she does it in a wild animal park filled with 800-pound Tigers if you do stupid things you're gonna win stupid prizes it's amazing how quick the tiger seizes the opportunity though from that video she was only on the driver's side of the car for a few seconds so then it was lights out pull that up pull that up it's a great video to watch one of my favorite movies wrong it's just I don't want anybody to get killed by tire I really don't but I do want if someone gets killed by a tiger doing something really stupid I do want everybody to watch that and go hey don't do that this ain't the Lion King this shit's real look at here it is oh god she gets out of the car the Wildlife Zoo she gets out watch passenger side backseat you just imagine the argument going on frontieres' I'm out of here yeah she's like I'm so tired yeah  she runs around the other side I gotta make one more point and the guy's like hey we just relax bitch just don't hit me don't hit me goddamn it get back in your car get back jail God just drags it away he runs out of the car Oh God and then the mom ones out and that lady's dead the third day he's dead and there's a the Rangers come out you're gonna try to save her see I think the move is closed all doors roll up windows I think grabs are so quick it's like this is what I've wanted I'm so tired eating I hold the meat served on an aluminum tray you you for keeping me here I think here's the thing man I think if they fed those Tigers wild animals they probably wouldn't do that they probably don't give a about that lady but what they do is they give the Tigers no animal reward they have an animal reward system right there the Tigers job is to clean up the population oh there's one this tiger flying through the front there whoa are you kidding me yeah ripped this guy's hand apart just flew up to the top of them it's alyssum fingers oh yeah yes his hand apart that Tigers don't play but if you let that tiger kill things like if they let a bunch of axis deer loose which is satiated demands yeah that would be what they look for they would chase down the deer eat them they'd live like natural but so they have this overwhelming desire it's like if you yeah of like if you were a guy mmm good way to put it I was gonna say if you're a guy and they extracted all the come from your balls that's a bad analogy dude don't run with that one but these animals they get their their appetite satisfied but not their appetite to kill they're born like you roll a yarn roll the ball yarn in front of a kitten cat dives on it because that's what they're supposed to do they're supposed to attack things they have a bill even little flirt fluffy little kittens they have a built-in desire to attack things I think that's why people are the way they are in social media they don't have the release that the human body soul spirit however you want to describe it is designed to get somewhere else and if all you get it from as a device through other people's pictures or selected posts I think you go crazy inside I think that is why I don't trust nearly every human being on the face of the planet it's just they're not I don't think they get the chance to express who they want to be I agree a hundred percent I agree a hundred percent and I think I've been thinking a lot about this whole boss-employee sexual assault sexual harassment thing that's been going on yeah every day and like and something else comes and it's always the same thing it's always a man in power and a woman who works for him and something goes down and it's never the opposite it's never chicks getting their  eaten by some dude who works in the office it's never there's a lot of women that are CEOs for it hasn't been reported yet those guys can keep their mouths shut right where the guy doesn't consider that to be harassment it's not if she's yeah she lets you her and she buys you a car you know Mustang the you go to the New York Post for oh my god it almost came out of my nose but if it's it but I think this is what I think I think that a lot of males write in a male in a position of power like the chief of the the village like that guy would probably have his choice who's the warlord he have this choice of women and the women would respond to him in a favorable way which would let him know it would indicate to him that it's time to right this girl wants it I'm gonna give it to her so when a guy is like some Harvey Weinstein guy or someone who's at the front of some giant company and everyone in the office kisses his ass when he's there and everyone's so happy to talk to him and people are angling for for raises and they're angling for promotions and they're always nice to him and they treat him like royalty I think the guys start thinking that these girls are attracted to him that they that he's gonna them like this it's a power thing but it's also like a trick on the reward system that the brain has then it's a scumbag thing to there's like a lot of factors in there I think I think it's a lot tied to the power side I cannot think of an example of any occupation that doesn't have that problem somewhere near the apex right when a man gets in power just I think power I think that as humans were only capable of dealing with so much fill in the blank when it comes to that whether it's the money or the fame or people throwing themselves at you I think at some point depending on the moral compass that you have and how it's calibrated it ends up swinging in the wrong direction because you can look at physicians you could look at religion you could look at people in the military generals in the number of sexual assault cases and the generals like one two four-star generals in the US and 2017 was insanely high to comedy Bill Cosby to you know just fill in the blank you can find an example everywhere once you start getting to the apex I think there's just a disconnect on how much depending on who you are going into that position I mean there's a disconnect on how much you can handle Cosby was a really weird one because I I've had this theory for a while that I think that during Cosby's era the 1960s I think it was not just common to drug women but it was almost like a joke like that people thought it was funny because drugs were fairly fairly new and the consequences of sexual assault weren't talked about and it wasn't thought about the same way and I think that though during that day like he has to joke around about it in his act I remember you saying that before yeah he had Jota they cut the Spanish flag up yeah and he even had a sex segment or a scene on The Cosby Show where someone would give something someone and would make them have sex with them or he would put them to sleep with something like he would joke around about it and he joked around about it on talk shows and stuff I mean this is but I think that when you talked to someone who was around during the 1960's they used to call it slipping someone a Mickey you have heard that term before yeah I think they just wants like quaaludes and she'd start coming out they start giving him to people just slipping him home that's so but it still happens man to this day it still happens you know I had these girls on the podcast of the day Corinne and Kristina from the podcast guys we and one of them was saying that she was hanging out with his guy and she had a drink and then all sudden she just couldn't control she and her friends I want to Pat her into a cab I like that right and rescued her you had your hands full with those two seem to me like you had like to wet cats in a paper bag that's what she was talking about a hat and you know it'll orgasm with a vibrator Mike well okay yes yes tell me more no I was listening that at my house I think folding laundry is in my head I'm like damn you've got your hands full with those two but they're fun it was an entertaining podcast for sure they're girls that talk publicly the wig girls talk privately when they have a couple drinks in them hundred percent yeah and that's what's so attractive about their podcasts I wish I had there I don't know what the term to use bravery or whatever it is to be that open and honest and like just it here is blank slate here's what I like here's what I don't like here's what I might like I don't know well is it's appealing though when someone does do it like if someone you can tell you like okay this person is actually there they're being completely balls-out honest yeah with no repercussions worsen so like say if they were an actress like let's find some famous who's a famous current actress give me like a hot who's out Jennifer Lawrence yeah she's already had that scandal she had that scandal where people got ahold of her pictures and you know was without her permission and like that yeah I'm out of my league on this one Scarlett Johansson okay let's say Scarlett Johansson if Scarlett Johansson if somebody like filmed her talking about how she had had an anal orgasm with a vibrator and how she likes having her boyfriend get his dick sucked in front of her that would in and she didn't know that people were gonna to like it would be horrific she but oh my god she's like have to stay home for days she have to pop advils and sleep on the couch with a blanket over her head you know no mean she'd be horrified I can't believe that got out this is so awful or she get to go on like yeah you goddamn right yeah but these girls just like blurted it out and then move on the next thing I like tacos one thing after the other but their that's their free you know and that's what people like those are people liked about Charlie Sheen till they found out he had AIDS yeah that was an interesting development in that particular story like oh this story takes a terrible turn yeah now I gotta change the lenses out on the glasses that I view you through yeah I thought you were winning yeah I thought you had Tiger blood just freakin winning and every turn that yeah it didn't really do realize you had to high five and the old Tiger blood yeah the the high five that he got apparently is what started that whole thing off what is insanity yeah I'm sure it is yeah well when he it turns out that when he was diagnosed with HIV was right when he started going wild and talking about you know snortin you know smoking 8 grams of crack and that's how I roll and all that  yeah okay and I'm sure when you start off batshit crazy it doesn't help when that's your baseline but you remember how people reacted to that though they were like yes tell us what you're doing charlie I mean he did a goddamn tour of theaters and he didn't know he did he'd sit down he would sit down and just be like alright so just got done smoking an eight ball well he would tell stories but they had to craft what the thing would be see what started out was he was just gonna don't go in this theater tour and he's probably on coke now if I could talk to the people they're gonna love us and he didn't know really what to do so the first couple of shows were a total disaster and then he started bringing comics in there with him so like my friend Russell Peters did a bunch of them with him so he would go up for a little bit and then go up or Mike would kind of host the thing oh so it was comic and then Charlie and they were sitting down talking and this way you get to hear Charlie's wild stories and talking crazy  but the comic would frame it all with some actual comedy and comedy in a comedic relaxed reaction to this maniac so they keep it on the rails yeah yeah and Russell's great comic and he's particularly great at talking like talking and ad-libbing like Russell's are great he like does a lot of crowd work in his neck so he's like super fast and sushi a Russell Brand's Russell Peters okay they say Russell Brand it was another guy you have your absolute hands full with on the podcast yeah he's character don't give that guy coffee yeah he had a lot of coffee well he's a he's a drug free character drug free sort of yeah no no drug free that guy didn't know drugs to kill all three of us in this room probably yeah he lived yeah god bless him now he's got a story to tell yeah but he's another guy he's pretty free you know even like with who he is now he's free and he's I cannot believe the transparency like I said I don't have I don't have the courage to just be like boom here it is let's just unzip the fly lay it out and here we are people like might though you just don't try okay you did if you treat my trolley I try my route like so for the podcast my rule is I just try to be honest that's all I try to do is just be honest in Potrero minds as I am and say the things that I actually believe and not try to add one percent to it but there's still some people were there were to ask me some questions I'd be like yeah that's for another day you know I'm not gonna answer every single question well also especially if it comes to like military  there's stuff you can't answer well then you just make stuff up oh is that we do pretty much is there's a lot of that going on right there's a ton of it going on which is why I most of the time I try to dispel misconceptions the reality is no there's really nothing that I've ever done that you can't talk about is there any books or anything that's ever come out where you knew one story and then you saw come on you like hmm I have gone to the bookstore and read books written by an individual who said they were on a combat operation that I was on and don't remember seeing them there hmm it's problematic yeah that seems like a real issue it's a huge issue I would say 99.9% of books that have a trident on them should be purchased and then put next to your toilet paper roll so when you run out of toilet paper you can just start ripping pages out of the books wipe your ass just showing that symbol it's the symbol that is associated with being a seal it's you know you get right when you get that symbol they change your designator inside of the Navy system and it registers is a 53:26 right so why do you think you see like them using that trident it's recognizable so they're doing it because they're artists they're doing it I can't say exactly why they're doing it I know some people are doing it purely to make money some people got out a little bit early and have used the recognizability of that mark to further their own motives down the road and are purely a hundred percent profit seeking other people are they're trying to tell I guess would be their story or their version of a story and that would be the people in the middle and then I guess on the other end the best example I put point people at is generally Jacko's book it's not a book about hey no there I was which is the number one indicator of a story that's completely false as oh hey there there we were like not you're done why is that people want to romanticize and embellish the reality of what actually happened and I don't know if it's the desire to make it seem like it's more than it was I don't know if it's because most of the time when you're coming from a military background you don't you're not you're not used to any level with people really I would call it fanship I guess or you know what I mean like it's it you it's the military and being in the military is not about money you know I could you can pull up online and see exactly how much every individual in the military is making based off what rank they are and how many years they've been in so people will be approached and like look this is how much money you could make if you wrote a book and they're like holy that's you know that and so they will and they'll make millions of dollars the problem is is if you start embellishing those stories in my mind at least it starts tarnishing the reality of what the occupation actually is and the good and sometimes amazing things that happen lose a lot of their value in my mind and I just think it's an enticement the guys are not used to inside of the military it's very when I was in the military I mean I feel like I was talking to Jamie before we started I feel like I'm late to everything I'm late to social media I'm late I had never listened to a podcast before I sat down and met you with tape really I had never listened to one I had no idea I had no idea the diversity of information that is out there and you can go and and I mean you can almost get like a an advanced degree and whatever it is you want to get by just going I had no idea never listened to one because I was so focused on something else and then you lift your head up from that world you're like what the is going on around here and you you know if you post the right pictures on social media of you and your outfit with your thousand-yard stare after the distance then you get more followers and then people oh come and speak and say and it just it's an enticing thing to individuals in my opinion that are just not used to that and it can really you can really I think it can take you down a path that I would recommend most people don't take which is why I like the way jakka went as he has experiences but he's trying to take those experiences and portray them in a way that people can make use of them it's not about the story it's about what he learned during the story and how you can implement that in your life yeah so there's a broad spectrum of everything from literally rip off pages and wipe your ass to recommend to anybody that I encounter that ass but I think Jacko's new book is fantastic and it's so short it's like it's an easy read that's what nature self anti-life yep book could change your life yeah because if those are those quotes are from a real inspirational guy yeah he's not trying to really be I would say he's not trying to be inspirational he's he wrote down and committed to paper the principles that he uses to live his life yeah his passion and his enthusiasm for getting up at 4:30 in the morning and working out unprecedented for like a week I was getting up a few minutes before him and I would just post on Twitter like up before Jocko hashtag don't be lazy and then I got tired and had to stop dude he will but of course he was liking I most like a team I'm trying to elicit a response out of you Jocko absolutely I mean because people I mean asked they will still ask me or I think he'll still ask him if we know each other and I've known him forever and I don't you can't you can't call how I like that I think it's okay I think it's gonna be all right if I make funky taco on Twitter it's gonna be all right yeah well especially if you know the guy yeah yeah he's not gonna get pissed about it but his problems like there's no funny man just rubbing more a little just cuz you up at 4:29 pipe a man if you want to be a lazy bitch go ahead and then I have to stop myself that's as far as I can go on Twitter because I will lose my mind and I don't want to be that person yeah you can't respond to many people yeah you have like a minimum or a maximum requirement per day just give yourself like a threshold I've looked at three different comments I'm out I don't say no you could possibly keep track or even tabs I mean your numbers are astronomical no I don't keep track occasionally I dip my toe into the water of social media but for the most part I don't it's got to be like an abstract painting rolling by there like 60 miles an hour you can probably just catch one or two things that comes by but also between working out writing comedy doing stand-up being with my family archery anything else I'm doing at the time yeah I don't have the time odd castes yeah UFC duties whatever have to do with the OSI I don't have the time it doesn't exist so yeah you're tapped out yeah so I do what I can I post stuff and then I get out of there and plus I don't the turmoil the P I don't wanna like you can't engage like what's that that if you what's that if you respond to every barking dog you never get where you going that you ever heard that it sounds good with you I think I paraphrased it but that's the idea behind this like there's no way you don't have the time and I have friends that have less followers who will go up like my friend Owen Benjamin he's  crazy he'll have Twitter fights all day long and I told me other day I'm like gross gonna stop engaging gonna stop doing this he's not go didn't ice people once they recognize that you engage it would it tastes them to hit you up more exactly and in your time is you're done yeah and then they'll try to piss you off and then you go back and forth with them oh well you and then next thing you know it you're up at 3 o'clock in the morning checking your Twitter just exhausted rested a just compliment people when they say mean things just right back I think you're an amazing human being heart emoticon sent by thanks thanks sweetie because they don't know how to take that no how long do you think you're gonna last in the winter today I'm gonna wind up keeping the place in San Diego and just coming back here in November no I have really not thought about San Diego since the day that we left MIT I am wait to get snowed in well I have cold weather stuff and I got a nice truck I do have a truck what kind I have a f-150 nice slightly modified though jacked it jacked up a little lift its it came lifted thirty five big tires 750 horsepower mud and snow tires problems happen hundred fifty horsepower yeah Jesus Christ what the do you have in the hood Shelby supercharger oh you went deep it came that way my wife was so pissed at me because I went in with my other f-150 to get an oil change and I technically did get an oil change as I came home with this truck and she walked outside she's like God government but a lot of those like super sport performance trucks they have street tires on them mine have mastered of knobby tires I literally went in I got very fortunate and I got a great deal on a Ford on unlike a pseudo endorsement sponsorship thing earlier so I had a bunch of equity in my truck I literally went in to get an oil change and right next to me in the spot was this Ford f-150 black ops model like the tusks by tuscany so i park and i get out of my truck which i usually feel good and i'm looking up at this other truck and now immediately feel like a bitch and I'm just and I so I climbed up on the wheel and I'm just reading the sticker because I couldn't read it from the ground I'm just looking at it like all right well that price is totally outside of my range and I go inside and of course the salesman happened to see me and he comes over to the service side of it you know I'm kidding I'll give him the guy my keys and he's like what do you think about that truck I think that thing's awesome man well let's just let's just run the numbers okay four hours later I'm going home in a new truck four hours it took you four hours the dealership your wife's calling up where the are you well she does that because that's not the first time it's happened I tried to buy her a car one time I told her I was taking her minivan in Honda Odyssey best urban assault vehicle ever dual open doors you could just take down a compound than that thing yeah long as you have blacked-out windows I don't stolen some rocket launchers on top of that bitch and just roll so I was like hey how they wanted to take you in I'm gonna take your car and get an oil change I was getting her a Tahoe and like three hours in and she starts calling it what are you doing Oh they'd found a leak in your flux capacitor it's gonna be a few more minutes about cars by the future yeah and so I come home and she's like oh I like that car it's the wrong color in the different seats and like god damnit so she went back and picked out her own so after a couple hours the dealership I think she realized something was up and yeah I drove over that yeah I saw a video where they were comparing that Shelby supercharged f-150 to the Raptor they were trying to figure out which one was better I don't know but I think that truck is ready to go for the winter time it's got some big old tires and entirely too much torque and power for me yeah it's brake a little bit loose yeah break loose locking differentials and all that jazz I don't even know what that means locking differentials means you can like you have it ar be locking differential and what you do is you set it so that all wheels will always spin together no matter what so it locks together so if you're if you're in a place where one wheel is spinning it doesn't work that way all wheel spin together and it's not good for driving down the road but it's good for getting you out of places and for traversing very difficult terrain you might have that I might have that up but locking differentials are a it's a must on any sort of off-road vehicle I never plan to take it off-road even though I think it's designed for the zombie apocalypse I tried a baby that thing and just Park it in the garage yeah but what if you have to look what if you have to go into the forest to get your elk well if you're packing out let's call somebody else there's a trail some sort of a logging trail call somebody else bring their truck I don't think you can use in Montana no I was actually thinking about that gonna win no I don't even know what I would use it for but I feel like I have it I feel like I would be more prepared for life in general with the wind chill morocco has over inch it doesn't suck the things badass never gonna use that which they do tell me how the winch where's my yeah yeah but you think of the confidence that you have get climbing into it you're like yeah I got a winch it'll wind nothing can stop me what the fuck's gonna stop me not gonna winch yeah you could pull something out of a ditch that's like a man thing like men want equipment they're never gonna use look good should always have a chainsaw just in case you live in a apartment in New York City why do you have a chainsaw never know might haven't cut down the door goes wrong goes sideways now trees start growing everywhere but we're ready for winter man it we got the ski passes ready to go I can see world-class skiing from my son's bedroom mountain we live just south of whitefish so in whitefish the mountain is called big mountain it's not big sky most people confuse the two big skies in Bozeman I think you said you had been to Big Sky before I've been to Bozeman so Bozeman has big sky thanks guys like right outside of Bo's just south of the correct and whitefish is just north of where we live in Kalispell and big mountain is it should be open in four days we went to Bozeman and we were there when they have this this grizzly sanctuary we took a ride to Yellowstone and we stopped the grizzly sanctuary and they have this it bears they're so big they don't even look like they're real and they throw them frozen watermelons and that's what they're eating yeah a whole frozen watermelon so they throw this frozen because it was hot out yeah we went in the summer okay and the bear just this giant block of ice you know that's what it is it's a it's a huge beach ball of ice that's like a 20-pounder yeah look the bear just opens his mouth and crushes it with one bite just cut through the frozen watermelon like it's nothing mmm it's so sobering and you watch a bear lying on the water right he was in the water like lying on its back holding this frozen watermelon in his paws and just chomping on it and eating it it's not a Disney movie Don this movie bitch by my brother-in-law who has never hunted before has purchased a red works one no ice already has boy he already got the whole weight he's already got a silver back sitting in his house he's already got an elevator rest and his bow comes in in like two weeks and he was trying to explain I was had dinner with them last night and he's trying to explain to his son and his daughter like it's not Bambi that I'm gonna go hunting with and they're just like no daddy he's kunti uncle no daddy you can't get but it's funny you know my kids why would you kill a bear dad or why would you kill a deer why would you kill an elk well to eat it 100% yeah it's it's interesting that I'll help people in my limited super limited experience into the hunting world they're very entrenched and dug in it's either know these animals like these is this is Bambi how could you do that or they have an understanding of what's going on like okay I have a friend who's a hardcore vegan and he's kind of an asshole about it but he's got dogs and he feeds him dog food and he buys dog food from the dog food store and it's got animals chopped up ground-up stuffed into these bags and he's good with that and I'm like you're a hypocrite I'm like you're great you really are he's like well the dogs are carnivores were not I go no you choose to not be a carnival you choose to be an herbivore okay but most humans are omnivores I was gonna say we evolved yeah evolved to eat a wide variety of foods and this this thing that you're doing is just you're standing out and he's an asshole he's a nice guy but he's an asshole and he's always been like a really negative guy like he's nice to me he's nice to his friends but he's always had this propensity for to negativity pessimistic attitude shitty to people yeah he's successful as a human being but shitty to people like for whatever weird reason just has this aggressive attitude and now he uses it against against people that are involved in hunting and he gets off on it he thinks it's fun you know it's just it's a weird thing that you can sort of justify the torturing and killing of these animals to feed your dogs but when someone wants to go out and hunt an animal to eat it like I get all the people that are pissed off that people go out and hunt lions and don't eat them and hunt elephants and don't eat them giraffes and stuff in I'm with you a hundred percent but here's the thing that's not eating deer that's not hunting Buffalo a bison and eating bison that's not eat hunting and eating things that we're talking about two totally different things and then when you get to like the Lions and the elephants and there's a real problem and the real problem is that there's not enough money in conservation to ensure the safety of these animals unless these animals are valuable in the most valuable way that you can present these animals this is  up but it's a price on their head hunting targets and I'm not I'm not saying this is the only way to do it and I think it's not but Africa is a crazy place in the best documentary about it is Louis Theroux who's a British documentary in' did this trip where he went to one of those high fence hunting camps in Africa you know those things I've never been to Africa I was in I was in Kenya but I've never been around anyone hunting people were you I was actually there building schools oh I'm a humanitarian show sweetheart I am a sweetie but Lois Thoreau's documentary movie through his documentary is amazing because you kind of get the sense of what it's all about like these animals a lot of them are going extinct just a couple of decades ago because there's massive poverty all throughout Africa and there's no money and they figured out that if you take these animals protect them put them inside a fenced area and talking about these enormous like 10,000 acre reserves preserves and then people fly in to hunt them on a daily basis they get a tremendous amount of money yes oh then these animals their populations are booming they're higher than they've ever been and the animals are protected they're no longer in any danger of being extinct but a lot of people are super uncomfortable with the circumstances I get that - I'm in the same boat as you'd like to me I don't like hunting a giraffe not not into it personally I'm not gonna make a character judgment against somebody who is or the elephant or whatever animal you may go to call it trophy hunting like I I don't know enough about it I would assume and hope that the situation is exactly like you described where the people who live in the area are managing and monitoring the species and making sure it's good to go and if they're doing that I have no issue with it and in the same breath I totally understand why it's very off-putting to individual to see a picture of that and just loses their  yeah I completely get the elephant thing in particular elephants to me and this kind of majestic sweet animal but the reality of people living in Africa is different people that live in Africa elephants destroy their crops trampled them I mean it really becomes a big issue of elephants move into areas where they're farming yeah and they have to do something about it and sometimes they'll they'll have to hire hunters or have someone come in and do it and then once someone does shoot one of those elephants the amount of people that come in have you ever seen what I think you posted a picture yeah yeah you work and posted a picture of I think it was an elephant and it was a line of people outside of the border of the picture I'm assuming they were waiting to come and get their share of the yeah or whatever it was from that animal yeah I mean these are people that have a really hard time getting meat and elephant meat as gross as it sounds to people listening to this is supposed to be unbelievably delicious if you were raised on it I mean you're supposed to taste really good I'm not saying just go out get an elephant burger folks but I'm just saying please don't actually the sole thing is it's very complicated and you could say well these people shouldn't be raising crops where the elephant's live the problem is this is not like any other thing like it's not like an encroachment issue like these people are living in a  village in Africa I mean this is like literally where humans evolved so this is this is a real situation of humans in a very small tribal situation encountering elephants that just decide that hey I'm an elephant I'm 10,000 pounds I'm just gonna eat your food bitch and you're gonna do and these people don't know what to do about it there's a lot of that and there's CS the other thing people say well elephants are going extinct so yes and no in some places the world you go to Iowa there's no elephants right Montana as well they're extinct no elephants yep but there's parts of Africa that have a lot of elephants and they actually have to control the populations and it's the same thing with deer like people in California will tell you you know hey you know you shouldn't shoot a deer you talked to people in Iowa you like please you got to shoot these deer my wife wrecked her car she's in the hospital same thing in Montana deer on the side of the road everywhere everywhere everywhere and you can see fur on the bumper bumpers in shield smashed it doesn't take a rocket surgeon to put two and two together yeah it's a very advanced degree I love how people in Montana have those road warrior grills oh I got one you go bring it come on dear apparently if you hit a deer in Montana you can call the Fish and Game let them know what happened throw it in the trunk yeah I like that that's good because then you you get to keep the meat the meat doesn't just go to waste I like that as long as you're not driving around looking for a deer well that's what someone said but the problem with that is the odds of you hitting a deer on purpose are like zero I know but if you try to avoid them it's a pretty high percentage I've almost hit a few like I don't want to hit a deer in this truck oh my god yeah I remember I was coming home once I had a gig in upstate New York and I was driving down to where I lived in New Rochelle and I hit this one patch that had so many deer I had to drive like 20 miles an hour in the highway it was insane if I wouldn't even get out of the way just darting in front of the road like left and right left and right and I'm talking like an infestation it was crazy and this is what happens when there's no predators and no hunters and you know you don't want wolves in your backyard people once you live in Montana how cool I would still take a strong pass on wolves in the backyard no I would like to see them when I was up there this lady who lived up there was talking to us and she said she lives in this Canyon and they had wolves come through a couple of nights before and I said what is that like she goes well it's two things she's like it's beautiful and you also you have to be cautious she's oh so it's this thing or you like I really love it they're there and I love looking at them but I want them to go away I love looking at them from the safety and security of the inside of my house yeah she's like well people get a little nervous about their livestock and definitely their pets I go there Pat's she's like yes that's number one they will kill dogs real quick I bet it sounds amazing mode to hear a pack of wolves in the wild I have no no experience with that it's gotta be I had never heard an elk bugle until September oh and I also thought that they after I heard them bugling I assumed that they did that all year round I just thought okay I'll communicate by bugling I had no idea that for basically a month you can hear them communicating like that and then they zip it and start working together as a little I probably heard yeah I had no idea and it was in a valley every when I was in the middle of my other than optimal hunting experience and just surrounded by beauty couldn't have had this conversation at this volume because it was so you know got to be me there's a film that's coming out Friday with me and cam went to Utah and we're hunting elk in Utah and there's one scene in it where we just every now and then if you go elk hunting especially this one place in Utah is this enormous ranch it's a private ranch and it's two hundred and forty thousand acres where were you in relationship to Salt Lake City couple hours in which direction I've I wasn't paying attention Chad was driving you don't know south east west my phone so I was in Utah got it look let's get off Twitter joke damn it I had to do email I was behind so um anyway there's this one part of the film while we're in there and you literally you might hear a hundred bugles around us screaming left him yeah it's just and you know the audio even if you were in like an IMAX theater would not do a justice no I couldn't I couldn't believe it I the one thing I know I don't have enough of his interactions around animals to understand behavior in like patterns and what to expect but I mean and that day was reinforcement of that I was sitting in my job was on the floor I could not believe what it sounded like it's like a like a mystical animal but the sound it makes it's almost like a Lord of the Rings character and when you watch him do it to just said oh like ah we watch this one elk this cow elk and that's crazy the way they do it the way they do it is like a Brock Lesnar double leg takedown like he got on top of her from behind and then boom he hits her one time and just shoves her forward and she collapses on her front legs and and he kind of like wobbles off of her but he is it he's a one-pump chump maybe that's what they're into that's what they're into yeah one bang get it done move on to the next and he's doing it all day long and four months yeah draining himself they lose like 3040 pounds oh do they really probably more yeah I bet them well I'm saying 30 40 pounds but they're you know seven eight hundred pound animal I bet they lose a lot more than that they get real skinny they stop eating they just like crazy for two pounds unbelievable animal but probably the most majestic animal that I've ever been around I cannot wait until next September yeah there's a real controversy in Montana about wolves because the wolves that are in Montana right now have been reintroduced from Canada they captured them from Canada and then reintroduced them to the Yellowstone area and there's a really interesting video about it called the wolves change at the wolves changing rivers I think it's called it's like a short film it's a short film I think it's called how wolves change the river and it all just talks about how the introduction of the wolves change the way the river flowed because is this it how wolves change rivers yeah it's pretty badass because it shows the need for predators it shows that you can't just have this overabundance of wildlife like undulates cows and elk and things because they eat all the grass when they eat all the grass the trees never grow a strong root system so there's a lot of things happen like terms ecosystem on its head mm-hmm yeah and some birds don't survive and you know there's like songbirds have like been spotted in like really high numbers in Yellowstone now there's a bunch of stuff they documented a lot of it is because the Wolves chase down the elk and and made the elk and it decimated the elk population like knocked it down like half but in the process made those elk like just a little bit more wary a little smarter still a healthy population but that's kind of how it's supposed to be it's not supposed to be like these hunters that live there they got super spoiled because they were used to like seeing hundreds of L roll it a bed like yeah slide open the door and get the laser rangefinder out and ran well especially if you're a rifle hunter which a lot of Maher there's way more rifle and I can get behind that I mean no I can't you need me it's the way I get I'm saying me myself personally it has no draw or interest whatsoever yeah bow hunting on the other hand now now we're talking what's the difference to you one I absolutely suck at and the other one I generally can hit what I'm aiming at and it's easier with the rifle like wind is the perfect example you take a shot with a rifle in high wind the wind when you're thinking of rifle is from the ballistic effect of the round you know left or right or the temperature and all that stuff win with a bow you're crawling on your belly being a ninja and then it's like animals going like god yeah completely different ballgame you could sit with a rifle with a cooler and a bowl of chili and get an elk well you know another thing that gets me with rifles and I don't think you should make it any more difficult it's not my point I think the most effective and efficient and ethical way you should kill an animal should be the way you do it but there's these pods that people have these tripods that they set up like Santa Maud with a bench it's essentially got like a mobile rifle bench sitting there on so it's got a slit Lina like a lead sled attached you can just bring your finger in from the outside and just bring it back and it doesn't move at all you don't even have to have it in your shoulder you lock it in place you screw it down so you have it the perfect angle you set it on the vitals and you just squeeze it off and boom and exactly where you want it in that setup you could actually not even have it shouldered you could go sit in a chair to the side of it and there's no people do it all the time yeah and to be clear I support hunting whether you want it however you want to do it I'm a full fan for me personally I just can't get into rifle hunting it's too easy if you put an elk anywhere from zero to 1,500 yards in front of me it's game over son right well you're an expert marksman though I mean I would say I'm a marksman I don't know if I would add expert to it but I can sometimes hit things it gets all humble I miss sometimes I got some good missed everything but when you see an animal and you're hunting with a bow so the thing is the difficulty and the challenge and the connection to the animals way more intense because you're trying to get inside of four yards the whole thing to me is it's not a matter of how much I feel like I can do right it's a matter of how few things I can mess up and I love fighting against the odds like that I love the challenge of having to worry about not only cover and concealment and you know high ground versus low ground but shadows and light and moving and noise inside of that moving and monitoring the wind and then the fact that the animal might just want to go take a piss and you're screwed you get that stock in the woods I got I got to take a whiz I love I love the challenge of it and I'd suck at it so I just it is a draw to me that and my wife was already shaking her head at me she's just like goddammit you're gonna hunt again yeah so I think it for some people there the issue that they have is that they think that killing an animal she not be this pleasurable challenge that it should be if you are going to eat animals you should be shooting them in the head with a high-powered rifle where you can't miss and they die instantaneously and there's no suffering if only that situation actually existed well it can if you shoot them from five yards well you know I've missed some big targets with a rifle from pretty damn close how close seven feet hey man when you're running it through a hallway it's tough sometimes you know if there's there is no 100% solution like it's true I get it I mean yeah but if an animal doesn't know you're there and you're setting up and it's a hundred-yard shot and you have a 3000 and you don't even need to get 200 yards realistic you can be a 300 or 500 or whatever you feel comfortable shooting at if you want meat though yeah it's the way to go but also why not enjoy the experience I don't think there's anything wrong with to me it's a challenge it more than a challenge in man oh boy it sounds gay but it's a journey I enjoy I don't know just journeys are gay it depends I guess on the type of journey how do you feel about the Lord of the Rings how's the journey it was that was a journey I've watched all those movies what about the books I didn't read the books I want to go to New Zealand and jump off the cliffs in that movie oh my god but the journey is like why not enjoy it right enjoy I enjoy the struggle I enjoy that it's hard to hit what you're aiming at with a bow in exponentially more so that every time you add a yard to the distance I enjoy that the animals are they have instincts that are amazing and that you cannot defeat their nose and that you can't control I enjoy all of that that to me is I think and I'm enjoying that experience and then again I this is my first bow hunting season I started bow hunting in late August so I have almost no experience under my belt but I I do enjoy that the final aspect of that as well tune getting into position and being able to perform in that moment I don't think there's anything wrong with enjoying killing an animal that you're doing so respectfully and like my freezer right now my else my goal is to never go to the grocery store and buy meat again for the entire year and I think our freezer is full enough to do that my kids love it I've made I got maple elk sausage I got Italian elk sausage I got bratwurst I got steaks I got roasts like we're not going to a grocery store yeah that to me like so why not enjoy that whole process the whole story are doing it ethically and enjoying the journey along no III agree with you but I just wanted to hear you spell it out because that's the issue that a lot of people that are sort of in the animal rights activist side of things one of the things that they would have an issue with is the enjoyment part of it but I can't help it if some people are pussies it's just the the challenge of like doing things that are hard is enjoyable and and succeeding at things that are difficult to do is also enjoyable yeah why can't you be happy about winning why can't you be happy about accepting a challenge willingly and nobody's forcing you into it and when you're successful you're not only happy with that success but you're happy with every step along the way I don't see any problem with that well because they're Bernie Sanders supporters I'm not qualified to talk on that topic people with you right relax you're joking around here folks yeah I love it man even if you're not a hunter I mean if someone doesn't want to hunt I think take prolonged trips to the wilderness I think it's great for you I think I started doing 2012 and it's changed my life I wholeheartedly agree I was dead serious when I say I don't think you figure out who you are until you get into those environments I have taken a sounding on the depth of who I am as a human being and the worst most physically arduous moments of my life and I and I wish that more people would willingly go to that point I think it would it changes my perspective for sure it changes my appreciation for things nothing will make you appreciate the little things in your life more than nearly dying and having you know and and like oh wow like I have all of these things that I wasn't paying attention to when people don't know other people who didn't listen here earlier podcast don't know your story so tell people what happened way almost died on the jumping side of the house no let's go to the military first then we'll go to the jumping side yeah I mean I don't know if I just seems like to me like you might be supplementing your need for danger with this jumping thing when you talk about how you describe me as a psychopath every time yeah crazy new dude you you're crazy I am the same this person that I know and then I texted you that once and you responded you think that's easier than you know I said I think I'm yeah what yeah because like well for one you willingly used to enter into fights and you have said before that you would have gone into the Octagon in an earlier age to me that's insane it's just for whatever reason like going in there and did willingly going and just getting into a fistfight with somebody how much martial arts experienced you have exactly zero yeah that's martial arts a lot like bowhunting how much you guys jumping experience do you have zero exact wanna take this you're making my zero on the ledger look at that look at that suit got damaged hers looks round weird fish eye lens Joe what I've been able to determine for my jumping is that yes people the world is round you saw it from the sky you could tell are you sure when I jump from pretty high here's something a little curve here's something that someone pointed out that's a really good point I wanna reiterate i retweeted it you could look at the moon with the telescope I was gonna go to the same place because I read that yeah clearly right folks okay try to look and find Mount Everest with a telescope and then explain why you can't yeah you can't because it's on the other side of the  plan dummies crazy people it's so sad to me it is people love mysteries though they love things that are hidden like hidden hidden information anyway that's why the seal books right there you answered why people will buy because of that goddamn symbol they look at they're like oh I want to know the secret of course yeah it's yeah and there is no secret that's right and that's the point I want to get to that definitely know what martial art thing but the martial art thing I think is a lot like the bow hunting thing and that it's very very difficult and once you start doing it you get better at it and then you get addicted to it and it's not crazy people like I'm not even talking about like actual competing and fighting but just training because when you're training you're competing like when you go onto the mats you train you're trying to improve yourself but you're also trying to tap someone who's trying to tap you and you go you're both going at it and when you do it and you get better at it and you get better at it you develop this kind of understanding of what it is and it becomes this like very addictive thing like guys are addicted hard to jiu-jitsu well is it possible to master or is it never-ending evolution well you are you'd be a master in comparison to someone who doesn't know what the they're doing but yeah well definitely physically the only problem is your body starts to break down now as you get into your older ages like most guys that I know that are in their 40s and for sure in their 50s like I was in Hawaii recently with Ed O'Neill who's a black belt in jujitsu a lot of people don't know Big Ed on the hill from married with children and Marin modern family that guy he's a beast seriously yes yeah uh-huh legit black belt in jujitsu one of the Gracie's yeah would have never guessed that so many for them to getting thrown in their head and choked unconscious but he was I would like to see this he was out there he is right there Ed O'Neill black belt training with Horry and Gracie do that what's the average journey to a black belt years wise I'd say 1010 is average and that's grinding like getting after not not Thursday every other week yeah but some some people get there quicker than 10 you know BJ Penn got his in three I was a brown belt for eight years eight years of brown belt I like your style Joe I was trained together I was training like twice a week and you know trying to have a career but you know for for the people that really get into it they really get obsessed with it it becomes just as addictive as archery hunting anything else it's and I think what we're talking about earlier when we were talking about people being angry and like on social media because they're not getting those natural rewards and the natural struggle of life and their life is very muted in that regard no struggle yeah or no struggle I think that's one of the reasons why jiu-jitsu is so appealing to people and even though you get injured in jiu-jitsu but most the injuries like tweak my back or I up my elbow or my knee got screwed up it's not like brain injuries the brain injuries were the ones that were the most disturbing to me because I was I was recognizing at like 21 that I was having some issues you were talking about this recently about this the headaches laying in bed I have and I know a lot of guys from previous career who are suffering from or discovering or the military is doing research into the causes of the brain injury issue it's not it's not awesome to read your future when you get diagnosed with that and like okay so what does it look like when I'm 60 what does it look like when I'm 70 like that's not those aren't good tarot cards to read my good friend dr. Mark Gordon who is an expert in traumatic brain injury and does a lot of work with soldiers and Andrew Mars foundation he has a warrior angel foundation and dr. Gordon does a lot of work with him and they have developed some really good protocols for helping guys and these help the shit-ton of guys and he does a lot of the work for like nothing yeah just trying to help as many people as he can because you know he's he's he's doing well financially you know he doesn't he's not desperate for money see he does a lot of charity works my point you know he's dedicated a significant amount of his professional time to trying to find solutions for soldiers and also he's done a lot of work with football players and boxers and fighters anybody who's gonna get that enclosed brain trauma at the end of the day I think on the chart it ends up looking the same doesn't matter how you necessarily got it the UFC is in involved in some new protocols now too they they've developed some stuff in San Diego in fact I forget what the medical institution that's doing it but they've got something they're doing with some sort of electromagnetic therapy magnetic resonance I have heard there's a it may well be the same clinic there's a couple buddies I have who came to San Diego La Jolla area they would go in once a day or twice a day for a quick session I'm pretty sure it was magnets placed either across from each other whatever it was a protocol I think it was for a month and to a person they all actually said that they had some significant benefit whether that be most of them were saying they were sleeping better and I don't know that causality or correlation there but there they had improvement it could have been their mood function whatever it may be but so how do the fighters what do they think about if you get knocked out in the UFC like you're just flatlined mm-hmm do you have a minimum amount of time before you can yeah go back I think most of the time they give them a 90-day suspension which in my opinion is way too short yeah because first of all they say like 90 days no contact but those guys gonna be sparring before then no that is the issue that I've heard with some of the active-duty guys now they'll go in and from a perspective that they kind of want to preempt and get an idea of where their head is at currently they'll go in and they'll get a scan or however they they couldn't give me the scans because I have retained metal in my body but I think a lot of it is based off of MRIs and the magnets and stuff and they'll recognize that they have the precursors or they'll there'll have damage to their head and the guys they don't want to take any time off they wouldn't just want to get back into it it's it's a struggle they're like hey listen this is could be what it could look like for you in the coming years and the guys like yeah I get it but put me back in coach it's a struggle to get them to take time off which doesn't surprise me that the UFC guys are the same way no that's that's absolutely the way they are especially the real savages the ones are the winners like Michael Bisping you know he lost to George st. Pierre and then three weeks later fought against Kelvin Gastelum and got stopped and a lot of people criticize that me included and they shouldn't let him in there you know I mean he needs time to recover he got battered in that fight got choked unconscious then you got him fighting again three weeks later it's just not smart but he would have probably and not knowing a thing about it fought tooth and nail to get into that ring but yeah I guess if I fight two weeks later it's a animal until yours yeah till you're done 60 and then you're drooling on yourself and you know your thing the Easter Bunny yep I mean that's not that's not a good look no it's possible yeah yeah for sure yeah you have to almost protect people from themselves or maybe there could be an argument that there should be sort of a comprehensive education for fighters at least because this is an elective thing right and what you're definitely gonna get hit for soldiers might make a good argument as well but there should be some sort of elective or you know some sort of an education thing that's the word I was gonna say at least at least educate to the just go in go into whatever situation you're gonna go into whether it's the UFC or the NFL or the military whatever just go in with an educated perspective instead of going in blank and and at the end of it not understanding where you're at it and why it happened so what do you think it is that makes you want to jump out of planes perfectly good airplane you put a squirrel suit on yeah do you think this is what I asked you before do you think that this is like you're fulfilling some sort of a desire for excitement some some need for extreme situations well it's so skydiving jumping out of an airplane is it to me if you if you follow some very basic principles you know being current and maintaining your gear and taking your time to pack your parachute the most difficult or not the most difficult the most dangerous portion of a day skydiving will be your drive to the drop zone and your drive home from so what happens to those people that up and die well there's two so you get a separate two categories there's jumping out of an airplane with a main parachute and a reserve parachute and a lot of altitude and a lot of time and then there's BASE jumping which is off of a static object with one parachute generally closer to the ground and that lack of altitude and separation from the ground gives you less time less options you got to be really tight on your a-game in both of those worlds what I think and what my opinion is that kills the most people is complacency there has not been a gear related fatality as far back as I can really find it at least in the last ten to fifteen years its people killing themselves not the gear killing them how's that work what do you mean how they kill themselves getting in over your head attempting a manoeuvre that you have no ability to recover from if it were to go wrong in the skydiving world so to use this the wingsuit as an example if you keep the suit flying straight it feels incredibly stable it feels like you're laying in an air mattress it's not hard at all but you literally get out of the aircraft and you spread your arms and legs out there's Ram air inlets that inflate the suit and you can lay on it you can literally just relax and lay in the suit and you'd fly it's 60% of your performance to make up a number that's probably somewhat accurate but then you know maybe you want to fly it on your back you know oh Jesus then maybe you want to fly next to people then maybe you want to do an intricate formation that's both vertically and horizontally separated I've heard of people colliding while skydiving strophic results like get ripped off uh yeah there was a pair of Golden Knights that guy decapitate they didn't Kathy the guy from the pelvis down cut off both legs but you can get yourself going you know hundred miles an hour forward speed so you cut off both legs yep what hit what his head his or shoulder head is I believe the lower portion of his legs what happened to the guy's shoulder he had a vacation in the hospital for a little bit and the other guy died yeah actually no what I think I might be wrong on that I think the dude with no legs I think the dude with no legs is the one who lived because he jumped again the guy who hit him is the one that died it's a it's jumped again after that yeah yeah yeah of course of course he did it's like when you text me like would you do this in France into the plane I'm like don't ask me a rhetorical question I was trying to get into the plane he was doing the squirrel suit into the plane but he missed yeah sometimes you miss and he bounced off the plane didn't look good so that was the same redbull dudes and that is probably the worst situation you could get into because you could see he was spinning in the suit yes and that is how you can kill yourself in a wingsuit if you try some crazy maneuver that you're not capable of doing you essentially stall the suit and then you end up on your back spinning out of control you'll black out and you know whatever happens happens what happened that guy that bounced off the plane he pulled it out he did he did because you know later in that video I mean but those so that guy that is Fred and Vince they're Red Bull dudes they're at the absolute apex of what's possible and yeah I mean he hit it he was able to recover because later in that video they were both able to successfully get in but that guy has been jumping for decades in tens of thousands of jumps so of course he can recover from that if you got 10 jumps you're dead but the problem is people see that video they're like I know what I'm doing on Thursday they do stupid  and they're not they're not aware of their ability or their skill or they're just not looking in the mirror and being honest with himself they attempt something crazy the most common in skydiving thing is somebody to die under perfectly functioning equipment they'll have a really small main canopy like most main canopies the the canopy you're suspended under and your harness when you're learning is about 300 to 360 square feet it's like driving a school bus it's really slow turns it doesn't dive and a lot of people try to get to these little postage stamp parachutes there are 71 square feet 69 square feet and in those canopies if you initiate a turn regardless of what you do after that turn you cannot pull the canopy out of the dive until it goes through its natural recovery arc so if you initiate that turn 300 feet low you're done maybe you'd be lucky to walk away with a set of powdered femurs which is exciting to watch from the ground it's very interesting noise to hear happen that's best case scenario middle of the ground would be wheelchair with a colostomy bag for the rest of your life worst case scenario you're getting carted off in an ambulance and you're dead and it's just a rush to get to that super small canopy or you just started jumping so this is like a status thing guys want to show you that they're jumping with the super small sheriffing you ever see people in the mixed martial arts world who just started and they think they're ready for the cage yes it's the exact same thing I bet you it happens and motocross surfing like you know guy learns to surf is like Northshore let's go like excuse me sir you're using a foam surfboard that's 12 feet long if you go to the North Shore you're gonna die but nothing you say that easier to use a foam one that's 12 feet long I don't know I don't know where it came from that from it probably on a smaller wave maybe I should get a foam but I think I think either way though on the North Shore you're going to die but till you try to tell that to that person they don't want to hear it they're ready and not only they're ready I need to go to Best Buy and get about four GoPros and then we're gonna send this thing and you're dead mmm and it presents this and creates this that's what I like I don't like to talk about the risk necessarily because there are there is in my opinion a community of people that really romanticize that risk and they define themselves by that risk where that's not for me that's not what I'm looking for at all but when it comes to skydiving it's just fun man I cannot not smile when I'm flying that wingsuit you're doing 120 miles an hour forward face-first every other bug in the mug oh yeah you'll come down speckled all sort I've almost hit a bird BASE jumping in Switzerland like it's just oh yeah that's it but again there's a difference between skydiving and BASE jumping skydiving is if you have enough experience and you learned that you can handle with most likely what's going to come up you can just focus on having fun BASE jumping is a different activity for sure it looks the same it's a different sport different Act I don't even call it a sport it's an activity how many guys have you seen die BASE jumping skydiving [Music] in a squirrel suit actually not that many I have seen more people die under the super small canopies turning to low and just impacting the ground I mean it's it's a sight to be seen where the canopy it's in such a steep dive like as you're the canopies up top as you pitch over your body is actually above the canopy so it hits and they they pendulum into the ground it's a it's like wet wet meat on concrete it you know exactly and you can hear it coming because the canopies whistle the lines that suspend you underneath the canopy they're cutting through the air and it you just hear do you look up and then why am as far as actually physically watching people go in May to I think but you know my last trip to Switzer in 2016 last year I was in the valley with my buddy Alex and we were there for two weeks and 15 people went in 15 yep now how many people were there that it's hard to say and that's why again I think you have to be careful talking about the stats and the risk because I don't really know how many people partake in that activity but I can tell you this of those 15 zero where gear related not a single one was because their gear failed it was in my opinion somebody attempting or just living there walking on a razor blade and sometimes when I go over there oh I will do that as well I'll fly close to the ground or I'll fly in between trees or I'll fly through a crack and mess around with that but I try to do it on a very limited time period I try to have outs and I try to work my way into that position and what I have seen personally which doesn't mean that this is the norm what I have personally seen with my own eyes is people that don't take that route and they want to go straight to just hey hold my beer and there's just no room for error and yeah that's a lot of people though like what what percentage of the people died like how many people were there I don't know probably a couple hundred hey so Jesus well that's just getting up 115 people croaked yeah that's a lot that's a login I I tried it again I try to be honest I accept the activity here's my thing I don't ever want to gamble but I am willing to take risk and I know that that activity has some risk associated with it but for me personally the benefit outweighs the risk and I also spend most of my year trying to put in place things that can mitigate that risk like jumping all the time and being current in my suit and I like I'll walk away but I've been at plenty of exit points where the weather wasn't good or the wind wasn't good or I just wasn't feeling it and I think a lot of other people probably had the same feelings and they're zipping up their suit getting ready to go and I'm like peace out man I'll see you later I'm gonna go drink a bottle red wine and you know have a glass yeah I don't I don't I would love to be the BASE jumper that has walked away from more exits than anybody else on earth more than I would like to be the base jumper that's done more extreme than anybody else on earth like how many times you think you've walked away how many times have you gotten to a situation where you're at the like doesn't feel right 15:20 Wow and some of those things will give you a two hour hike on the way down you know I kinda don't want to hike down that's what gets a lot of people to is they'll get they'll there's a lot of hiking involved like the YouTube videos that's about five percent of what it actually takes my favorite jump in Switzerland is about a two and a half to a three hour walk for a 90 second flight so the ratio of busting your ass to smiling is very askew it's like Disneyland pretty much except it's actually fun and it's not full of pedophiles so really what kids are where would you get a fewer pedophile and think of it that way come on that's like being a freak and going in the strip club come on there you go you know what kills me about Disneyland my kids love Disneyland so we go there quite often there's these gangs Disneyland gangs have you ever seen them before what are you talking they wear vests like they're in the Hells Angels and their vests are covered with Disneyland buttons and patches Disneyland employees you're talking about oh no these are gangs of Disneyland fans and they used to have entry admission things where I like to get into their there see the Disneyland gangs do remember what I would say is Empire a second ago about the pedophiles yeah hitchhikers Disneyland Walt's misfits SoCal yeah with a skull with Disneyland had on and these people go in there they have things that would they would have to have like little things to that they would have to accomplish to get entry into these gangs and one of the things was they would have to have one of the rides go down so they'd have to make a ride go down in order to get entry into this stupid gang how does one do that throw something into the gears yes that's good thank you for that when we were there this one dumb lady this is this is how genius this dummy was California screamin is the roller coaster where you do that loop where you go upside down okay on the top of the loop this dummy threw her purse and wanted to catch it on the way down mm-hmm like she had this idea how that work it didn't work it hit the ground the it hit first the roller coaster ran over it stopped the roller coaster and they got stuck like three-quarters of the way up through loop and you know everybody's like yeah they stopped the roller coaster or she went to jail another you want to hear something really gross one couple they had a two-year-old kid and they they caught them on security cam after the fact they hung back and they put their kid near a Disneyland employee and they went went away and stepped away so the kid was like confused and know what to do so this Disneyland employee kept an eye on the kid and then called security and the security took care of the kid and then they went to dinner and they had drinks and they went out and then they went and retrieved a kid afterwards security not everybody should have kids but just can imagine the monster you have to be to take your two-year-old kid you like I'm tired of having this kid hey I've got a great idea I'm sure their home life is amazing very nourishing monsters man and you wonder like when you see a school shooting or something crazy like what happened this kind of does you're raising a potential human being this kind of happens you have some morons that are allowed to have kids yeah and they basically on an innocent victim which is my biggest issue with it yeah I cannot I don't like the victimization of innocent people it drives me nuts yeah man especially a little two-year-old so it's crazy it's crazy that someone has that in them they could be that stupid that they have that in them and you know I wish that this is an isolated incident I'm sure there's like quite a few those yeah I'm sure there probably is I can't believe you're drinking that kombucha stuff it's good love it doesn't the right brain do the same thing for your gut no no that's a nootropic and the right brains alcohol is probably bad for your gut I'm trying to counteract the effects I had with kimchi either absolutely not I've seen that thing from for the mind spent some time in Korea and watch those guys pulling that stuff out of the ground and they would offer it's like I'm no I don't want to kimchi I'm more convinced now than ever that Plus having a bunch of like really good podcast guests that explained the the benefits of probiotics yeah and about how probiotics literally affect your gut ecosystem that affects your personality and your immune system and just all sorts of different aspects of your life but I've been eating kimchi almost when I'm at home daily pretty much daily me good by itself for my parrot with a meal i pair it with a meal usually but sometimes I'll just open up a jar and just eat a whole jar of the  that's disgusting today I had kimchi with elk and jalapenos and there's some stuff called no bread nose a company that makes KN o W they make these gluten-free breads that are made with nuts and almonds and how's it taste it is good it actually tastes like good no not totally not like a good piece of like San Francisco sourdough bread does not taste like then but it that's what it tastes like but it tastes good enough it's good for me and most importantly it doesn't jack up your glycemic index it doesn't you know you don't have an insulin spike you feel good after you eat it you still uh you still ride in the keto Train most of the time I will  off on occasion I will off I  off all last week I was in Hawaii and I off hard so Thanksgiving was an interesting adventure and diet for me too I drank every night I dessert every day yeah hate whatever I wanted I said I'm on vacation I'm gonna treat this like a vacation I'm gonna have no restraint and I'm only gonna I gained four pounds and I worked out every day I worked out every day why does it only take one week to unravel what seems like a lifetime at work and then you start climbing back into the saddle like okay cool I guess I'll just move an inch at a time here lost two miles along the way well the good news is I kept working out so it wasn't like I came back home like terribly out of shape feeling terrible and having gotten drunk every night I bet if I didn't work out every day I probably would've gained like seven or eight pounds Oh hundred percent yeah he probably at least still kept your metabolism up in high yeah but I was like this is what I'm gonna do does I'm gonna treat it like this I'm gonna work out every day so that I don't have to think about it so I could just go crazy you're managing guilt yeah yeah I ate breakfast one day and we stayed this place that had a buffet and they had chocolate croissants I had four chocolate croissants and then I had two pieces of banana bread and I had two sticky buns these sticky buns and then then I had all sorts other food on top of that I just ate like a like a glutton isn't it amazing I don't usually do that so it's nice to do it for a video just amazing for a day or two yeah but I felt so weak like when I would go to the gym I literally felt like I was working out underwater like my blood was just combating all the booze and all the shitty food with that or I'll find my gas tank is just done yeah like to start you normally like okay I'm gonna warm up yeah it's like oh yeah I think I'm done here this place had a heavy bag and I knew they had a heavy bag so I brought boxing gloves and hand wraps and everything and I have a timer on my phone so I set the timer up but I just whaled away it's great because you know those Apple earpods yeah have a set pods probably the best apple not to make an ad for Apple probably the best thing I've ever bought from apples they're great yeah air pods are great there's the thing when you have a this timer it would play me music but then the timer like the noise of the timer would also go through the air pods so you're getting both yeah so when it was getting like 10 seconds it would alert me through the tube but I would think like oh man punch in the bag and even kick in the bag those air pods are gonna fall out no yeah they didn't i've actually yet to have them fall out yeah regardless the only time I've had them fall is when I'm doing chin-ups because my shoulders just  massive they touch my ears so they didn't fall out they were ripped out by your massive shoulders they just my ears bumped up against my my shoulders that's it it's the only time I've ever met Lee fallen out but it what's interesting is you take one out and it knows that you have it out so the sound stops like how the did they figure that out which is dribble one out now I'll have no problem talking why you have headphones on they just start talking well they see the headphones and they just start talking to you to pretend like you can't hear them and you point to the headphones and they're like no no no you have to talk to me they talk louder yeah if you're on the phone give a if you're in the middle of the most important audio book ever yeah getting the secrets of the universe right now people won't talk to you man I think that might be more of a problem that you deal with as opposed to others but it's and I think girls get it more than me I know those words I know women who have put headphones into their ears and not even attached it to a device it's good just so people will leave them alone stick it right in their I don't know if you can hear yeah I don't know if that would necessarily work what island do you go to no Hawaii my favorite is lanai is that where you guys went for Thanksgiving oh we went to the Big Island this time nice but I think lanai is the way to go cuz ain't nobody there and you got to take two flights yeah yeah you gotta go to Honolulu and then you take a little puddle jumper a little one of them little Buddy Holly killing plane there you go I got some magic backpacks you can borrow this strap unless your packs oh no don't say that how much do you weigh sir and don't lie please don't lie actually padded by about 10% you're gonna be okay yeah I wonder if what they do if they get like a really overly weight person who they know might be full of like I don't want to I know what happens ladies I know what happens they jack up a couple of pounds when I was super young like I just I remember that I went on a cruise with my grandparents to Alaska I don't know where we started but we went up to Alaska when we were flying back from Alaska puddle jumper - probably Juneau - get on the big plane and they looked at my grandfather like a little up and down like sir you're on the next flight really yep they bumped him grandpa how to gut grandpa he was he was built big boy he was he was built from the belly button up to the chest like a beach ball like I wouldn't want to be in a puddle jumper with a really big guy that was full of no you kill everybody yeah at some point the planes like hey I know you're pulling back on the yoke but I actually can't take off so you're all gonna die now and that's not the way to go either right because someone has an ego and they can't tell you they're 400 pounds in 350 yeah so they I think they actually took his luggage off and he had to come back like that I think was the next day well the real problem is for someone who's 400 pounds they have to find a scale that goes up to 400 pound or you get a time it as it goes around but Joey Diaz was telling me that that when he was 400 pounds like they didn't he didn't know how much she weighed because the the scale at his doctor's office only went to 300 pounds and he had that pegged bang and then you know he'd lose 50 pounds and it would still be pegged I think that's not a good sign no I mean I'm not a doctor obviously but I think that all this stuff when you see all these people that are like morbidly obese I think this is all there's a lot of things right there's shitty food there's bad gut flora a dick addiction to like refined carbohydrates and sugars alcohol a lot of things that make people that fat but on top of that I think a lot of it is that they don't have like real physical challenges you know life on a daily basis especially physical challenges that they enjoy that forces them to be disciplined about their health and to understand that their body is a it's not just your body okay it's like you have this variable vehicle and the more time you put into it and the more you pay attention to it the more discipline you use to keep this thing running the better it's gonna work for you and if you use it all the time you're gonna appreciate it but if you just use it to walk over the couch and crack a beer and start filling your face with chips and cookies you don't think about what it is and you don't have to rely on it to survive you don't have to chop wood you have to you have to carry anything you know you're not to do anything you got to go you get a look on your phone for the right app to have uber deliver your food so you don't even have to get off of your ass that's a new thing it's a new thing but I bet you it's pretty popular but it doesn't come to your neck of the woods I bet I wouldn't order it even if it did I don't have restaurants in your town well yes we also have electricity and running water no we do I thought you had a well I do it my at the house we have in the woods oh it's amazing well you should come visit sometime wells I like the idea water is goddamn it's good oh yeah it's unbelievably clear spring water it just tastes different yeah it tastes different too yeah I like the small town we have we have everything we need probably a couple things that we probably still need and not much of what we don't is there any crime I'm sure I actually yeah I bet you there's some a little bit off the rails crime I think any place so we don't live in whitefish whitefish is like 15 miles north of us I'm pretty sure there's a large like white nationalist white supremacist I've read some stuff about it I haven't really looked into it too much but I knew that they were getting ready to do a little bit of a March type action rally you should walk around everywhere in blackface I don't think that's the call I was thinking just driving my truck through the white nationalist rally is it because my truck is black so right yeah that would be you know the metaphor except when I'm tiki torches and see if you phoned me man Charlotte walking on the street with Home Depot torches I still can't figure out if they're serious oh they're serious they're really with the home depot tiki torch in your hand yeah you're serious the other serious they just want a torch and they're so stupid they don't really it's how that's gonna be mocked you know I don't know if they even care I think they're just glad they're either getting coverage so that they feel that their message is getting out to everybody who needs to hear it well nobody did need to hear it because most people didn't know that there was a group that that stupid that's willing to go into the streets like that and do it in this day and age you know and you're on the internet and people gonna realize oh you're a Nazi you have a swastika on your chest you dumb okay yeah all right there you go buddy I don't know if it's that bad up in Whitefish but I do know that there is I have found this like you give to the remote areas it seems like drug-related crime might be a tad higher gets a little messy yeah I was gonna say meth but I'm not sure I mean anecdotally I think from my perspective that's what it seems to be like but I haven't I mean I feel super comfortable I don't feel yeah I mean I don't know I do it feels it feels smaller is the only way that I can describe it and that feeling feels awesome yeah it's peaceful right yeah it's like word for sure it's it's slower - yeah it is like I said the only regret is that I wish we had I wish we had been able to do it well we would we were able to do it we just didn't do it I wish we had done it a couple years ago yeah I felt that way about Boulder Boulder feels like that to me Boulder feels to me like you know it's only a hundred thousand people which is way bigger than your town yeah twenty-two thousand that's crazy but just everything's like huh just calm boulders an interesting town it reminded me a lot of where I grew up in Santa Cruz very left like a great place if you sellin tofu Santa Cruz is a great place to grow up the problem is is that a lot of people don't leave Santa Cruz it's it's so far left that it ends up on the right somehow there yeah it's insane and I you know the guys and girls that I went to high school with a couple have never left and not that I haven't really maintained contact with them but even if I did I don't know if I'd have anything to talk to him about it's such a insulated and they like so this small town that we live in I like I want my kids when they grow up and they get to the days they got a leaf they got to go and experience something else I don't want them to think that that 22,000 people is this is how the world is right it's not the best thing I did in Santa Cruz was leaving at some point a friend of mine has been on the podcast before he used to be on this podcast called citizens radio and he was a like a real heavy-duty lefty social justice warrior type character and somewhere along the line he ran afoul of them because he dates girls like an axe the girls and girls were calling him predator or something like that you really didn't do anything wrong like if you look at it on paper like okay what did he do wrong there was nothing there was no rape there was no assault there was no harassing it was him trying to get laid which I thought is normal but I guess not in that world it's problematic in the social justice world it's problematic to be an aggressive a sexual predator attorney and really not cool at all but what he said was that when he was in that world he didn't even it wasn't even aware of dissenting view points because he was so insulated because everybody in that world thought a certain way yeah and so you just get accustomed to these very rigid sort of channels of thinking and everybody sort of follows these channels and he literally wasn't even aware of the possibility of there being a dissenting point of view that was rational how do people not realize that that's inherently dangerous they get caught up in it people are super tribal you know I don't have to tell you that I mean yeah I agree but it's at the same point like I try to recognize in myself like if I'm whatever consuming anything information if I'm Blake okay I need to go and figure something else out or hear another viewpoint or at least try to balance it mm-hmm to me like the spidey senses start going up if too many people are saying the same thing if everybody's all chanting the same it's like what's going on we might be down the rabbit hole here and we need to take a few steps back yeah but that's because you are winners and some people are just not there Tiger blood but I'm trying there's some things that people have that are like unfortunate and one of the things that people have is this like deep desire to have other people like them and to fit in and to cause zero friction and to be amenable to the the groupthink you know it's like it's a real it's a common issue with folks like you see them like just slotting into groupthink ideology and whether it's groupthink on the right side a group thing there's a lot of really dumb people that I follow on Twitter that are make America great again people like I'll go to the hashtag Magga every now and then and just like just to start reading tweets and just just like Macaulay Culkin from home alone my hand on my head going all oh my god these people are serious you know drain the swamp hashtag drain the swamp and I'm going I'll read these people's tweets I'm like these people are just Apes that are in a tribe they they are really really not all of them folks don't get me wrong there's a lot of people that are make America great again people that really do feel like it's a good thing to have this guy in office stock markets up I'm not talking about you but I'm talking about people that have this tiny little brain and this tiny little brain just needs to slot into a place and this is where they found this is their spot and and you go on to their Twitter page and these are on all day arguing with people about Trump all day accomplishing nothing no but they feel like they're they got a huge microphone and they're getting absolutely nowhere yeah and they just every just constantly checking the responses checking their tweets checking their thing you know it scares me about that is it again I feel like I'm late to the game to everything and I'm in social media late to the game podcasting late to the game like a stone you're like I'm trying to play catch-up and I used to look at the news and largely except you know what I could corroborate on each side and now I can't look at any of that and so I just have to use my own eyes but I see with my own eyes people arguing with their head down so much about what they believe that they're actually not seeing what's happening around them and because nobody trusts anything and they only repeat what they say it provides the seams for people to do  that as a country I don't think we want to go in that direction in that distraction moves are being made that people aren't paying attention to yeah I feel like with all this thing about Trump and Russia and everybody thinking that Flynn is gonna turn on Trump and this is it we're gonna trump's going down trump's going down like hey guys North Korea's got nuclear capability and they've just launched some new missile yes my CDM yeah high into orbit that's capable of reaching America do you understand what's happening like and we're sending stealth bombers over to South Korea like we we are literally a few steps away from the brink of a nuclear war we're not there yet but we're in the Nate we're we're where we should hey everybody should be going hey hey hey hey what what the is going on over here yeah like what is this why are we even battling them what the is the issue other than the fact that I mean if you want to talk about going somewhere where you have a real communist dictatorship that is a Ruth Ruth Iron Fist military dictatorship that has an entire country of people enslaved North Korea's the spot I mean it really she's a video of that defector yeah holy you might pull that up I'm I'm ahem got Swiss cheese and just kept the foot in a gas pedal kept going the median on his truck oh yeah shot five or six five or six times riddled with like parasites yeah big parasites two feet long my man I mean there you go what motivates somebody to run that hard and that fast and he made it and he made it he must be sleeping so good right now yeah he's probably getting fed I mean just imagine how how God look at this dude Oh get something I'll fall down buddy nice okay I probably played it off that was like ya wanted to shoot see is that all they have no they have the full thing yeah you get the Nightline version of it so you can get the the full actual video the the full actual video but it's pretty interesting he was getting shot at in the car yeah you can see the trace around there really close to him yeah and it doesn't have so many shots this guy's just hauling ass here's my question you think he was playing the radio like yeah Metallica and kickstart my heart yeah he's just got Metallica Ripa I'm going for it North Korea soldiers pursue the man while he flees in a military vehicle what kind of cars you got there it looked like a Jeep it looks like a Land Rover daughter so he stops the car he gets out and he's running and they're shooting at him from like feet away fortunately the guy on the far right got a pistol he's not hitting he's tripping over his buddy that guy's got a rifle though oh my god the Korean soldier accidentally clocked crosses into South Korea during the pursuit so that's the line right there I do not know so that's all you have to say you ugly turns around so there's not a fence I don't know you just have to get to that spot and I know about the DMZ shot and injured the defector is pulled to safety by the South Korean military whoa that's amazing oh these people calling that looks like the South Korean people yeah they're dragging him holy cow I didn't know about this oh my god see the blood trail oh that's what that is yeah more than likely on a thermal that's intense that's intense so you want to talk about an Iron Fist dictator that's happening right now in people all they can think of is just look at that go look at him go he's out 5th gear yeah I don't I don't know the rules on the DMZ or where the actual line is this video unlike South Korea's side is I think someone saw this taking place looks yeah so it looks like he's driving from north to south yeah does he just have to get across that gate so this is just like a DMZ it's almost like an unedited for just like a 10 minute version of it wow I guess they just constantly monitor everything how weird must that tension be between the north and south is staring each other in the opposite side of the line and they both look exactly the same yeah both Korean you know it's like the u.s. wall with Mexico people who go it's race is it's racist because one people are brown and when people are white they can't even say it's racist over there they're both the same race just look at each other what and then they're at war they hate each other and ones the enemy and ones not one has no money one is under the iron rule of a communist military dictatorship where they kill everybody the other one they're making the best cellphones in the world the chicks are all getting plastic surgery you know the the boys are all hip-hop break dancers and and it's like they have MMA over there they have everything South Korea's that their tight window is pretty awesome Seoul is an awesome town but they're here yeah I've been there I spent my 20th birthday in Seoul Korea in a bar people that think that socialism and communism is the answer to the woes that capitalism creates do not understand you just missing the point that is that isn't it's it's so contrary to human nature and it is by the way never been pulled off successfully in human history yeah I would love at an example and that's what I always ask people just give me the example of what you want to use as the foundation for those principles where it's been executed properly where it's thrived where it's survived yeah and I'll just sit here and wait and another part of the problem is that the people that are really like the people that are in the left that are like really progressive and support Marxism the idea of Marxism and socialism those people are in general very supportive of gay rights very supportive of women's rights those are the first things that get trampled in these communist dictatorships that is the first thing that goes like every single one of these communists Marxist rules homosexuality is treated as the devil like these people they live in hell that you don't understand it is very difficult for me after a long period of time the majority of my adult life to peek my head up and look around and in it most of the interaction like I said social media I sit back and I watch and I see the things that people say and I see the complaints that they have and oppressed this this that or the other and I'll be the first person to say that there's inequality in the u.s. just like there isn't every nation on the face of the planet or but to hear how people think how bad we have it and then to have seen with my own eyes places where people would claw their way across the border to have the opportunities that people in this country have just waking up the Sun rises over the United States and they wake up and they have so much opportunity to they don't appreciate it's very difficult for me to make sense of what's going on it's a bizarre place to be in because it's just like who are you people and where do you get these ideas they're they're idealistic and they think that we can do better and I think that we can do better too but I think where people go a foul is where they start saying that they want equality of outcome and equality of outcome is contrary to equality because when you have equality equality real equality meaning you can do whatever you want to do that breeds inequality yes because some people are gonna work harder and competition is what pushes things and some people think that competition is bad and the reason why they think it's bad except makes them feel bad like I put something on Twitter today where they were saying that fitbit's the people using fitbit's is fat shaming and ableist and it's problematic and it causes all sorts of issues and these these educators we're looking at fitbit's as being it's a real problem with the emotions of people you know they find out like and they start comparing and it can cause all sorts of issues with people so they were literally saying that fitbit's they're just devices that give you data yeah but these things can be a problem how about competition is a good thing it's a good thing yeah how about it's okay to finish last because it'll motivate you to get off your ass you still have either board exactly yeah go again you don't win every time stupid it scares me that people are in positions like I'm looking at my oldest son is 14 and I mean I realize it at some point in time in the very near future he's gonna go off and you know he's gonna want to pursue a higher education and I almost would rather send him to a trade school where he learned something with his hands or I would hope that he would I would never tell him to do that I would hope that he would want to go down that route instead of going into an environment that is completely artificial where people portray this world of you know rounded corners and nerfed everything and you your feelings and words hurt and all you talk about it all the time actually I don't want my son to go into that environment he's already experiencing that a little bit in the school system that he's in like he uses the word triggered and his teachers will use that word trigger and I'm like listen oh it's okay to have somebody say something to you that invokes sorry and reaction or emotion in you that causes conflict that's okay don't run away from that conflict once you go directly add that conflict and figure out what your problem is with it or figure out why you have an issue with that and then work through that and you'll be a better person on the other side of the house I feel like these were in a place now where people are creating it's an artificial environment that as soon as you leave that environment you're gonna get your teeth just kicked in yeah and I don't I see it trending more and more and more in the US and I almost think we're getting ready to fall flat on our face and I almost think we need to to figure out who the we are and to pick ourselves back up and and to realize that those artificial environments that people are trying to force onto the world it just doesn't work in campus cities and um I understand on sort of campuses yeah it's just it's just really heavy-duty left-wing people that are just committed to this ideology and they don't have I mean it's good to have both sides I think it's good to have people that lean left and people that lean right and you try to figure out which yeah bound which way works and by the way it's gonna work better for some way some people to be left and it's gonna work better for some people to be right but this lack of tolerance for other people's ideas is one of the most shocking things about the left these days yeah is this this need and desire to shut down speech you know there was some day also the people who are on the forefront of saying you know freedom of speech but not that not anymore you know there used to be the the new left is more stifling a free speech than the right by far the new left would you know you'd call neo-marxist or more postmoderns I guess I'd look at it differently like freedom of speech to me in my mind is not about what I can say to you well it's not about me saying I'm gonna say something you know messed up and try to offend you to me freedom of speech is how much can I tolerate from somebody else how much am I willing to listen to an opinion that I absolutely hate but I'm gonna allow it to exist because I'm grateful that we have an environment that that can exist in and you're not gonna get pulled into a public square and get your head cut off well there's certainly that but there's also the only way you find out which idea is correct is you have to have debate you have to have open debate you have to have the ability to communicate your ideas freely yeah and if you don't have the ability to communicate your ideas freely the other person just bulldozes you with their ideas because they think they're right and I'm gonna shut down everyone else's opinion because I'm right that's not how you handle free speech the way to tell you the opinion isn't allowed right if you hand a bad speech with more better speech you you you become you have to have your arguments laid out in a way that it's convincing to the people that are paying attention and you can't do that if your speech is stifled and that's what's really a problem with the left these days and it's just and I think a little a big part of it is these artificial environments you're talking about they live in these insulated things I go saying Jamie kills teen used to live in they live in these insulated environments where they think they're right they think they're doing the right thing by behaving like this but it's so short-sighted and again I don't I don't try to make a character judgment on them but to me in my mind again with what are my own eyes I think the biggest threat to this country is political correctness and safe spaces yeah I truly think that teaching people in that man or getting them not getting them allowing them to think that that is how the world outside of that environment operates is setting you up for a very long-term failure because you're gonna just get crushed because there are plenty of other entities throughout the world that will look at what you're doing and say oh that's awesome you're just teeing it up for me that's a complete vulnerability they're gonna leverage that against us and manipulate not manipulate just attack the fact that those people feel that way they'll take it as a weakness and they'll leverage that for their success and when the more  yeah I don't necessarily think we're cuz I think there's enough people that are paying attention that think it's terrible and there's a lot of us but I think that when something like 9/11 happens one of the things that I thought that was really interesting right after 9/11 was his rallying cry of patriotism like everybody had an American flag on their car this is this is interesting to me did they have him hanging over the overpasses up here in LA oh yeah in in San Diego that week I would say was about a week after 9/11 I have never in my life felt a level of solidarity of just not only that but people were nicer they were nicer they were more upset there was made more really worried that you cut him off in traffic it's a you know what take the parking spot ya know you can put your cart in front of me not grocery store mean for us against them how fleeting was that though pretty freely doing whole but it was amazing during that time too the overpasses in San Diego American flags hanging out like not just an American flag covered the entire thing it was unbelievable they resisted longer in New York New York they kind of had of a daily reminder yeah the feeling there was different they were just it just to change the way New York City was New York City was almost like a village so you have a friendly villages they've been at act and everybody was like super thankful that they were alive and supportive of each other and also the Solidarity you know the Sebastian Junger is a war journalist you ever heard of him I've listened to every podcast you've done with him Restrepo is one of my favorite documentaries he's amazing his book tribe changed the way I understand that I'm like oh this is a natural part of being human and like we were talking about these reward systems that are built into animals that allow you know Tigers and like they don't get the natural release these natural reward systems for good or for bad human beings are designed to deal with conflict with real conflict and when we don't have real conflict we make up our own  conflict and when real conflict shows itself then everything sort of normalizes and that's it's for good or for bad we haven't evolved past that whatever our DNA is whatever our programming is and I've got a very almost at a cellular level we're designed to have a certain amount of risk and when we don't have that risk we don't have that danger we don't feel good and you lash out of people with your egg icon I'm gonna kill you hey bro unless you were here in my face and then I wouldn't say that I'm not sure yeah that's it yeah I was a crit I'm in I remember watching the second airplane go in live standing in an apartment in San Diego thinking this might change some things yeah yeah I remember just waking up someone called me where were you living at the time okay I was here yeah it's getting some phone calls from friends I was like what turn on the news turn on the news he turned the news and like just having it all sink in like what the yeah and then me and man I used to have a picture of it me and Eddie Bravo and Joey Diaz went to get burritos and there wasn't a  plane in the sky and we're hanging out that day because all air travel had been suspended and we were just hanging out thinking how bizarre it is were like dude are we at war like what how is this gonna change everything did Eddie feel better because there weren't any contrails up there it wasn't the same guy back then he wasn't that deep into it no no he liked aliens back then he was intellect material he as he became older he became way more conspiratorial I have a heart i I know I've texted you before like hey does he actually think those things or is he he loves conspiracies I think he thinks of them almost like some people like paying attention of sports but then there's also like Illuminati stuff that he legitimately worries that like Hillary Clinton is gonna off him because he talks to us about like I I think I think it's entirely possible the Clintons are murderers I think it's entirely possible themselves are outsourced out sourced yeah I don't think that I don't think they have the stones to do themselves so I don't think so but I think they've they've definitely made some calls or at least had some meetings I just too many bodies I have any people attached to them that we're in critical positions that either like one recent guy vanished there's that seth rich guy who is the new yorker that worked at the DNC that got shot there's there's enough of them and then there they go away the stories go away the one that I pulled up the other day who was who do we do in the podcast was was it Callen the guy who had dirt on the Clinton campaign it was demmick and he vanished the guy vanished you don't hear about it this guy was about to like give dirt on the Clinton Foundation and like whoops he's just not around anymore can't find him I think their ability to hide and not just their this guy yeah academic at heart of Clinton dirt campaign vanishes leaving trails questions is he still missing oh this is a part of the Russia investigation that's right it wasn't the Clinton campaign it wasn't the Clinton Foundation yeah he's gone man it's missing poof I did I just think it's amazing the ability for people to have the public face and then who they are I have I have not personally had any interactions with Hillary Clinton but I have some firsthand friends that have had direct interactions with her from either a security detail perspective or being on the ground and securing an area that she was traveling through and the public face that she puts on and how she treated those individuals up to and including people that were tasked with to her personal security up close detail the story is that those people have would melt your hair but none of those stories come out there's the person that she you know portrays herself to be during the election cycle and this is Who I am and then you talked to all these people who live at a day-to-day level with these people and the difference between the two is like sitting there trying to broad jump the Grand Canyon it absolutely blows my mind the stories about her in particular and her hatred or what they had told me her hatred for basically in essentially people in military or people who were there to support her doing her job just the anger and vitriol that she would attack those people with on a daily level is unbelievable anger at the military and anger Harbor said that she was literally campaigning to be the commander in chief yep of the military yep just because it comes out how did she behave to them one of the best stories that I have was I won't say the agency of the person worked for was basically she was exiting the White House and he said good morning mrs. Clinton and he was in a uniform at the time and she stopped and turn around she said hey once you go yourself don't talk to me when I'm you know in going in-between place a to place B wherever she was going to cut back in her car  yourself more that I have that version of a story again not personally for me I'm basically saying the things that I've heard other people say to me in confidence directly but their uniform these stories correct uniformed whether that be it could be a military Secret Service fill-in-the-blank they wear you warm also in the way these stories hundred-percent it's exactly the same behavior when the cameras are not rolling and it's terrifying because yes she is she is campaigning or was campaigning to be the commander in chief of from what I can tell again having no direct relations with this person a person that despises almost I would diss I would describe it at that is what the organization stands for unbelievable I'm not surprised with what stunned me is how the left was willing to just absolve her of her she was against gay marriage until 2013 her obvious belief system the like who she actually is versus like what she you don't know yeah what she's doing is being a slick politician just like her husband publicly she's the tide she'll also rise and fall with whatever the trend is but the 2013 thing like the fact that like how could who who the  who's educated who the was a Democrat at 2013 still thought that a marriage should be between a man and woman who gives a yeah like she did because that's what she does she licks her fingers she finds out where the way I was blowin and she goes that way and when you see the difference between what call me said about the investigation and what the investigation had found on her emails and what the illegal activity that she had participated in versus what she said you know what the deleted emails the 30000 deleted emails and all that stuff and when there's a video that shows what he said versus what she said oh yeah I play him back-to-back with each other it's like how anybody could support her the idea that you wanted someone other than Donald Trump I get it the idea that you wanted a woman a historical first for equality I get it I get that too but this is not your one there's got to be a lot of women out there the two choices we had out of what 360 plus million people now yeah god do insane yeah it just it's proof that the system is broken yeah I agree it's compromised for sure you know the only thing good about having a guy like Trump in is he's not from the system is that he used all of his money and kind of jumped in and the financial system still being supported obviously because he's a big part of it but the political system is in chaos I mean he's not a part of that at all and never was so besides donating money to them yeah that was the only thing that people thought was a saving grace about him being in office like let's see but I think he's crazy I think he might literally have dementia I just wish that somebody would grab his phone doesn't really do they try no just like real quick and just modify the app so but before he hits tweet and it goes to like one or two people who give it just a quick sanity check and then they're like yes prove checks he checks his comments he blushed people I know people are proud about that I've heard you talk about and I've looked at like I'm blocked by presents like man but again I look at that as people have their head down not paying attention to what they should be paying attention to because in those seams of people losing their mind over a tweet what the hell is getting passed through in regulations and bills and I'm like that's yes it scares me the EPA scares me the most because you know and what they're doing with the national monuments there's people that are they had a meeting this morning yeah what'd he do two different parks that I can't remember him but he shrunk him by a whole lot when a million yeah it's very scary he's carving out land and national monuments for privatization and there was one that they were they were talking about in Alaska that's very close to a gigantic salmon fishery Trump's shrinks Utah monuments in historic move I wonder what you want make that bigger please how to read it if only the sandstone stands stones could sing imagine the stories they tell of dinosaurs mammoth hunters and ancient ones known as the Anasazi all Rome's southern Utah over the eons long before the Native Americans struggled to hold their land against the Mormon settlers modern life and now Donald Trump scroll as president Trump arrives in Utah Monday afternoon it's this rocky corner of the Wild West is a battlefield once again but this time the Warriors were carry briefcases and the lawsuits Trump by signing two presidential proclamations on Monday Shrunk the size of bears ears National Monument by more than eighty percent and the Grand staircase-escalante national monument by roughly 45 percent fundamentally reshaping the two large national monuments man that guy I mean what can you give me why other than the gunner's as you say there's got to be an economical motivation behind gotta be resources it's got to be national resources got to be minerals or oil or something like that so and that's my thing like why so if you go to Fox News right every every leading above the break article is Hillary this Hillary did why and why is that not leading cuz they're not really Americans there are little puppets I mean this idea that they're they're just for America no you're a puppet of the GOP that's what they are they're not really American they're corrupt they're corrupt as everybody else's they're the worst like that the thing that if you're yeah blind allegiance towards the president when he does stuff like this that's crazy you have to call and some people do like that shepherd what's his name shepherds Shepherd Smith yeah that guy the perfect eyebrows he calls the president okay I don't know I've ever seen his eyebrows but I'm gonna take seems he seems like he could have been one of those guys that was upset at Hillary Clinton up until about 2013 yeah I think I think I hear what you're putting down there but again you know so people are they're losing their mind about tweets and then Anna monument got cut by 80% and another one by 45% and I mean and that's one example I don't know and then and I agree through they are corrupt and what I have found in myself and again what I think is dangerous is that I've stopped paying attention yeah and as soon as that happens I don't know what the hell is going on yeah that's what happens with a lot of people and a lot of people just want to mean you feel like you can't do anything other than vote right yellow in protest and you have a job at a family how do you have time to protest and so a lot of people shut out because they just don't feel like they don't feel like they can represent their opinions in a way that's gonna be meaningful and impactful yeah it's just it's a terrible job the job of having one chief monkey that controls 300 plus million people and yet definition yeah and then here's the thing if you are the chief monkey if they show that you're a liar if they can show if there's like proof that you're a liar should be removed from office if you get if you are if you are in court right and you swear on a Bible and do you commit perjury you'd go to jail like why is swearing into office for the United States why is that less of like a situation where you could be charged with perjury like that seems to me to be far more significant you're literally in control of the country you can do things like this yeah thing the nice sign that shrinks these monuments these horrible reductions in the power that the EPA has the Environmental Protection Agency is to protect our very environment he's like no no no we don't need that we don't need protection trust me we got me yeah you would think that he would be held more accountable because the stakes are so much higher and it affects so many people yeah I mean the amount of Lies that he's told since office they're stunning and you could just get away with them yeah you shouldn't be able to get away with lies as a prison I think lies as a president willingly lined is one thing to being misinformed yeah willingly lying as the president they can show that you had information to the contrary what you're saying you should be removed from office it should be a disqualifying factor for sure percent yeah a hundred percent but we've never had someone that lies this much we just don't know about you well no one has been able to be proven to be this much of a liar we've never had that or someone lies so much you're like wow yeah I mean like there's a website that was documenting the number of times Trump lied truck it was like they documented all the Trump lies over the past year and it's that's crazy it's it it's just it's so frustrating as of June 23rd Oh every day here's a different one yeah I mean what's that what's the website calls from the New York Times Oh some flies on top yeah I mean scroll up we could make it larger so I could read it here yeah I don't know man I don't want to I don't even want to read them I'll just get super depressed well the only issue I have with that is that people were really quick to jump on that bandwagon and all I would say is you should be prepared to have that level of scrutiny thrown back on yourself true because ma I mean how long would everybody else's list be you know I mean that's the one thing that I had like once you get into office sure would that list be the same like if you knew like if I say Andy stump do you swear to take the office of the United States President to do the whole thing hand on the Bible from there on you got to know that you have to keep your together our percent you can't lie yeah I agree and like I said I'm not I'm just I wish people would take that level of accountability on themselves as well too I think the country would be a better place if people acted as if there was an organization ready to write down a list of their deficiencies at any given time I think you're totally right I think you're totally right but I think that what we're seeing is for the first time like a president that is showing why we have a real flaw with this idea of one person being yeah chief dawg I think he's scaring the piss out of people and usually a topic swings back around to like nuclear weapons or nuclear war and like can this one guy really go and just hit the button well also the real problem is I mean this guy is very strategic I mean he's thinking he thought about reelection he filed for re-election almost immediately but did he really yeah there's a strategy for that too meaning that and like I forget exactly what the strategy is but it's in terms of how people are addressing him and how people are talking against him because they'll they would be running for president they would also be if they're running for president because he is a presidential candidate there's like certain rules to behavior and this is very calculated yeah what a chess move man it's a very it's a big chess move so this this is what disturbs me the most about North Korea because there's one way to ensure that people want to keep the same president and that that way is war like once you are in a war say if we are three plus years in he's campaigning for president again and it escalates with North Korea the propaganda escalates the lies the and who knows who knows what the happens and then all sudden there's actual military action mm-hmm that is going to ensure reelection I think hmm or would I I could see that or it would flip everybody against him I could see swelling in both ways it could it depends on it depends on how scary people aren't depends on if we get attacked if we get attacked I guarantee you he wins again because nobody's gonna want Bernie Taylor I'm going to go there and I'm gonna promise them equality I think if we got attacked by North Korea yeah his escalation might be nuclear in in level and then it's we're all we're glowing in the dark yeah if that works if his stuff works I don't know that's I tell you what they you want to talk about a war that I would want no part of North Korea Oh daddy yeah no thank you rugged terrain controlled environments no thank you very much and they got some big old armies just call on Elon Musk and send in the drones those Boston dynamic drones I could do backflips get those new robots that they have tell you what right now the drones are carrying the lion's share are they I'm yeah I don't know if people realize how much I mean it's they are carrying probably the lion's share of the kinetic activity throughout the globe I mean they're they're doing as much as they can with that really yeah like how much drone activity things going on that we don't know about that we don't know about I have absolutely no idea but how about that would have to imagine that it is I would have to imagine that it's substantial it's it's less risk from a risk to force perspective because if you're looking at it as you're the person who has the drone it's less risk because you're not putting a physical human being at risk or launching a force or an asset or a helicopter that could fill in the blank go wrong and then on the other side of that risk so is that how are you really sure the person that you're going after is there are you really sure that they're alone are you really sure that you can action this target in a way that's not going to have collateral damage so they're two different tides of two different sizes of the risk and I think that right now the American populace would probably rather not see flag-draped coffins and just assume that business is being taken care of it's so disturbing the idea of that getting turned around on us is even more disturbing think about it from that perspective if somebody launched the Tomahawk missile into downtown or not in tomahawk because they're not enough fire Hellfire there you go or JDAM or fill in the blank yeah in an LA China flies a drone over or whatever North Korea flies a drone over and they juice the US bank building in downtown LA how would we respond to that it's it I mean I sit back and I freak I kick my I just do mental judo in my head trying to figure out what the hell I did with almost 20 years of my life and did it actually do anything important and where is everything going and like what in the  yeah was i doing for some long it I struggle with it quite often how so I worry that too my biggest fear is that my children would have to finish something that I started but I also think that the success that we had as a military drove the creation of the enemy that we're fighting we took an organization that was largely geographically co-located and we were so effective at finding them when they met in groups of people that they splintered and they spread apart which is you know why now it's more effective to fly a drone over as an example Yemen I have no idea if that's happening but it's easier to have a drone over Yemen than an aircraft carrier sitting off the coast to do something about it so now we have an enemy that was in a couple of countries that's now in 30 40 50 60 70 countries and you can't really cut the head off of that snake anymore and I'd look at did I do anything that made my kids lives safer to do anything the major daughter's life safer and I would say in the moment I feel I feel like I had a difference in the moment but I think in the grand scale of thing looking things looking back that everything that I was involved with I almost think that the tide has washed it away and it's very frustrating how so because I was I was only able to impact the battlespace that I was physically in right but imagine if you weren't there well so and so then I advise others like you weren't there the role that we played I think is absolutely essential and looking back on my career I think the role of what I did was to create space and a barrier and a boundary so people in this country could be a complete and complain about their rights and freedoms and oppression and inequality on us that we have to create an environment where the things can thrive and flourish and be in a melting pot and figure out who we are so we have to have that role but I just what frustrates me is seeing what's going on in the country or had seen what's going on in the world and thinking that I was involved in something that was important but just realizing all I was was a point in time is sticking my finger in the dam that had 15 different water spouts coming out of it right so you didn't have a total solution but you certainly mitigated a problem we made it a problem only but in that moment in time and if you weren't there to mitigate it in that moment in time who knows how much it could have escalated who knows but who knows if the time that I was there mitigated the problem or kicked a football down the road and made it worse and it's a problem that your kids are mine are gonna have to solve in the future and I don't know those answers I don't I really I was a hundred percent and still am one percent committed and very proud of the actions that I took because at the end of the day I made the decisions of my actions I got to where I'm super lucky and privileged to wear the american flag on my uniform and i got to be the example and the beacon of what i wanted the u.s. to be every time that i got i mean i would encounter people didn't know what the US was they'd never seen an american before and how I acted was the u.s. to them so I think it was important and I'm proud of those things but I just hope at the end of the day I made a difference you know instead of trying to run uphill on a soft sand berm and go nowhere isn't that part of the problem with military action too so you don't really know what the result is ultimately going to be I mean everybody hopes and you're in a you know there's two sides right correct they both hope that they win you don't really know what the the results gonna be and it's not a difference in commitment on either one of those sides people need to understand that as well too it's not that I was more committed than the people that we were engaging with and with on a battlefield or anywhere in the world it's a difference of opinion they believe what they believe just as much as you and I believe what we believe whatever the issue may be and I don't know I'm not I'm I can't say who's right you know I just did the best that I could do to try to fight for what it is that I believed in and I don't know it's tough at the end of the day to sit back and think and be like god dammit what I do with my time yeah it is it's a daunting feeling to think that there's never going to be a time when we really are at peace worldwide I don't think we ever will be but I also don't think we ever have been no I don't think we ever have been either but do you think we ever would be if we would were attacked remember that last one of the Reagan speeches we talked about how quickly we would put our differences aside if we were attacked by an alien force from another world I think it would change some things instead of being local in San Diego and having or an LA the flags up if the entire world was challenged with something that we had to come together with I bet you there would be that feeling and it would cross probably any and all borders the UFO dorks though they grab that they thought oh my god this is proof is proof Reagan knows Reagan knows but I do feel like almost like what we were talking about with 9/11 right like that being attacked made people more more acceptable to each other more they felt more connected to each other you know let people in front of you on the highway that kind of hey when you have you immortality in your life thrown in front of you I think he creates a palette that is much easier to appreciate the little things and I don't think most people experience that is it weird for you when you you know you've spent so much time in combat and spend so much time overseas to come back and see all these people that really don't know the darkest side of the world currently I mean people have a view of what the earth is in 2017 and if you live in San Francisco and all you do is you know you work at Silicon Valley and hang out in the tech industry you think this is the world in 2017 because this is your world yeah this is your insulated look like we're talking about you don't really know the world until you go into the forest you go into the forest you go oh this is the world to the backcountry is still the world it's just oh this is what it's really like yeah when we don't have these artificial structures and when you spent so much time in combat and you come over and you see all these people that are fighting over these insignificant things and squabbling about the use of the preferred gender pronouns and all yeah crazy that people find significant today it is very challenging for me to listen to the things that people feel are important in the lack of I would say it's the lack of what I would consider to be perspective and it's funny if you do say I did 17 years in the military let's say a guy does 20 years you actually don't spend that much time in combat let's say you do a six-month deployment you're working even at every night of that six-month appointment which isn't gonna be the case so every other night so now you're working 90 days of that time you might spend 30 minutes in combat in those 90 days multiply that by five six seven eight nine deployments in 20 years that's your total time combined in an actual combat environment not a theater of war but a combat environment where you're directly involved in it but that time period for me changes the way that I view the world not only that time period just a time spent in those countries in seeing what's the standard in other countries and what's the standard here and when I hear and again I think we talked about before I you know people talk about inequality or oppression here in this country and I'll be the first to admit that there's inequality which is fun because there's inequality everywhere but let's have take a little bit of perspective here if you are fortunate enough to wake up in the United States of America the water that you sit down on the toilet over to take a is cleaner than most of the water people on earth are gonna have access to you go to Starbucks and you may pay more per ounce for a cup of coffee for the fluid than you do the gas coming out of your pump going into your car that exceeds the annual income of most people on the face of the planet you living in a first world country where instead of spending your time trying to find that water you get to spend your time sleeping in line in front of the Apple store waiting for the new iPhone to come out and then you have the balls to bitch about how bad you have it that to me is a super tough pill to swallow because you want to talk about oppression and you know suppression of freedom of speech I've seen street corners that are still read from lopping dudes heads off because they voiced opinion that was counter to the opinion of the day that will change your perspective on whether or not words hurt you and you know it what rights actually mean and you'll be like you know what what you say is actually really offended you know it's offensive to me but I'm glad we live in a place where you can say those things moving on with my day how much does that change your perspective on human beings when you're in those environments what you think a human being actually is I have an inherent distrust of most most human beings I mean if I'm being totally honest I'm I don't say that I'm antisocial my wife would say that she probably wishes that I was more social but I just kind of just take a step back and just try to avoid interactions with just about everybody that I encounter I would imagine that your spectrum is so much wider than the average person spectrum in terms of the atrocities that people are capable of committing you've seen I mean most of time right you're operating in this one small little sort of village in the spectrum that most people are that are in civilization you're in this one little tiny area but you've seen the full thing I mean you've seen horrible horrible yep that's got a I mean there's no way that wouldn't have some sort of effect on how you would approach people well like I said I have to it puts me in a position where I almost have to sit back and I have to bite my tongue because I don't share the opinions that most people share because if the military service that I have gave me anything I think it gave me a different perspective on the world and it's only because I traveled to more of it than I think most people get the chance to do when I got to see more of it not through my phone and my Instagram screen but through my own eyes and that all it really did is just changed my value perspective of life of the little things it it just it makes it it makes it hard sometimes was there like a single or any significant moments that you can recall that really shifted the way you think about things and what perspective doesn't mean knowing that people capable of horrible I think the times that got me the most on that is where you would see adults talking kids into becoming suicide bombers just that evil evil who instead of having the stones to come and face you will go and try to talk some innocent kid and strapping on a suicide vest or a suicide belt and walk into a crowd and clock it off I mean that that is to me the most insidious type of evil because they they're not willing to actually engage in themselves they want to prey on victims and that's if I have anything I hate in the world it's that it's the victimization of innocent people watching that and seeing that that forever throws a different shade on your glasses for sure just knowing that people are capable of doing i I am I am not surprised by anybody even human behavior that I see which doesn't necessarily make me any more prepared but I also probably in the back of my head have a different thought process when I enter into situations it's not like oh hey everything's gonna be great like I get my plan to kill everybody first and then I relax a little bit who said that probably Tim Kennedy yeah have a plan to kill everybody in the room but and that's the thing and it was it McMasters it might have been yeah be be friendly be courteous but have a plan to kill everybody in the room and if you're around human behavior that would put people on their heels and turn them white in the face long enough that is gonna become your default position whether or not you want it to be or not I'm not a violent person I probably the last person you could draw into violence but I'm not also surprised by violence and I'll react to it accordingly if I encounter it because it doesn't surprise me right so you know I would just think that I mean I've just got to believe that a person like you this experienced that insane level of cruelty and evil that your view of the world that you would be really intolerant to people that do have this sort of narrow-minded view of what the United States is and our role in the world and how the rest of the world views us and who the rest of world is and I'm incredibly appreciative that they live in a place that provides an environment for them that they can have that narrow-minded view I'd rather them be that than have that place not exist you can be the biggest asshole you want to an ominous sit back and be grateful that that place on earth exists for you to be like that you know and I understand the idea of the non interventionist foreign policy that if you know we never were in these places we can have issues and I just is 100% false it's just another way to look at yourself as a victim is it I think so in my opinion yes you can it's easier to blame oh well if we didn't do this then they wouldn't do that no how about real evil does exist and there are always going to be people who want to do something about that regardless if you're a pacifist you're a Catholic fill in the blank you will have your axis somewhere on earth and they're coming for you well it's also those parts of the world in particular are so ancient and people have been living there for so long I believe that they have the echoes of the past and them so deeply embedded in their culture and and their actions I mean you're talking about parts of the world that really they've had people living there for five six thousand years and the the ancient barbaric instincts of those people just have got to be those those echoes have got to be sort of reverberating through those cultures some of them are very interesting I think one of the biggest difference differences that I saw between Iraq and Afghanistan in the United States and you know a couple actually no death definitely those two countries in the Middle East is that there's just a different appreciation for life they there's less of a value of life because I think they almost find or expect that it's going to just end sooner it's very very different culturally and yeah I don't know I don't know if that oil in water will mix or if ever can mix or we need to have a third party that acts is something in between that allows us to gel or me I don't know it's I don't have a solution for it that's for sure and when you look at like how long there's been conflict in the Middle East it almost seems like an insurmountable issue there's been conflict with man since the history of man right I mean and that's why I say I think we're in a forever war right now we probably were in a forever war before it's just I think the face of warfare has changed along the way and the access to information about that has drastically increased which changes people's perception about it right like we're always involved in some sort of a conflict but what we think of as a war is when we have our troops over there our citizens over there enlisted then we say oh okay well now we're actually at war yeah yeah and with this war especially what's going on in Afghanistan it's been going on for so long yeah coming up on 17 years that's so crazy yep and what's happening over there I mean what are we accomplishing I don't have a complete answer for that in my opinion I would say that they are trying to do their best to stabilize that region of the world by supporting the government would be my best chub just murderous murderous in the sense of not being able to describe a properly explanation of what's going on ma'am and Iraq is the same way don't think for a second that we ever had boots off of the ground in Iraq it's just talked about a lot less we still have a presence there the people don't understand we still have a presence in Korea we still have a presence in Europe that's how long you have to stay if you're willing to invest the time for stabilization which the US military I would argue is not very good at those type of operations you can do it but you could also probably do open-heart surgery with a shovel too it doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna be the cleanest so you should probably have a military and then you should probably have some sort of fix-up crew yeah I mean I think they try to do that with all the non-government organizations or other government organizations I just think it's really difficult and you know in the Middle East like you said you're talking about people have been there for five and six thousand years the 17 years that we've had a presence there they're like talk to me later son when it's at 1700 I don't know have the solution for it at all I mean it's these are the things I think about the solution might be moved to a town of 22,000 people you're goddamn right it is it might be just just disengage I do better try to enjoy your time I do better with it there but I mean it's uh I'd spend an inordinate time amount of time thinking about that stuff trying to make sense of that that amount of time in my life how could you not it's 20 years of your existence on planet Earth well most do it's a lot of time nope and it probably would have been more if you didn't get shot well I actually nursed it out for eight more years after I got shot I did in another deployment after I got shot which was probably not the best call because I had some residual effects from it and almost got to the point where I was like okay I need to call a helicopter in and come pick me up because I'm I'm inhibiting the other people that I was with Wow I didn't want to be done I mean I got I got shot in 2005 so I was 27 super super young in comparison to where I am now at a place I wanted to be operating at a level that I wanted to be operating at and then you know I'm in an Indy car doing 800 around the track and it's like oops just put it in Reverse by accident there goes the training down on the track and just try to rebuild that and it took a while but yeah I ended up strapped it on one more time and then at the end of that it was like okay I can't do it why did you want to go back like what was what I mean this is something that Sebastian Junger talked about a lot and tried I think for me it was more I needed to I needed to do it for myself when I got shot it scared the out of me you know there's a lot of a lot of times in the movies there's this just blind heroism and it doesn't matter what's going on and you know I'm just gonna run through the hail of bullets well I was flat on my back and but when the round hit me in my hip by the time I hit the ground my first thought in my head was that my femur had just been shattered and I was gonna bleed to death in the space of your hamstring in your quality you can fit your entire blood volume in there but I'll be dead in about a minute that's what I was thinking in my head before I hit the ground and then what ended up happening that night happened eight people ended up getting wounded I was one of the least wounded people so they were flying people out on helicopters I got put into a Bradley Fighting Vehicle and taken to the Green Zone in but it scared the crap out of me and not only did it scare the crap out of me it absolutely crushed my confidence in my ability to do my job which up until that point I thought that I was at the very least competent and capable of doing my job and I had everything was going great up until that moment and then and then it didn't and I had nothing but questions and a void but I had to pull myself out of and it was probably very selfish in my desire to go back and my desire to continue doing what I was doing but I had to build myself back up to a point where I thought I could operate again and I remember very distinctly going back to Afghanistan in 2010 and standing outside of door getting ready to go into a door on a house thinking in my head do you still have it and then going into the door and I needed for myself to do that again so I guess regained for me a sense of who I was and to regain my confidence Wow what did what did you fear would happen if you didn't do that I feared that I wouldn't know who I was because when I was younger I'll be the first to admit that I believe I put too much weight into what I did as opposed to who I was I had too much attached to being a seal it was and I and I again in my opinion this problem that I see with people that struggle when they get out of the military is if they attach too much of their identity to an occupation that they've walked away from they really struggle most times not always but most times and those people can end up getting themselves into some pretty bad positions and went for guys who get out from that career when they go off the rails me they go off the rails in a big way because we have two speeds we have fifth gear and hold my beer that's the only two speeds that we have yeah and I thought I had lost that and I had I was at a point in my life where like I said I was where I wanted to be doing what I was wanting to do I thought I was doing it right and I mean it I thought I was going to die in 36 hours after getting shot I got off the stairs of an airplane in Virginia Beach and my wife had my son in a stroller and was pregnant with my second my middle son it just was such a bizarre series of events that happened so quickly and I went from going so fast to nowhere to having nothing to do to not understanding why I couldn't train my body to get back to where I was it was the only job I've had in my adult life other than working for my father I had too much I had too much invested in that occupational title and I think one of the best things that I was able to do in my military career was to survive it and get out and to move on that's one of the hardest things for fighters as well it's a big thing with MMA fighters boxers too they just don't know what to do when it's over they have they become these incredible winners in this one Avenue and then once that's done they rarely achieve that same kind of success and anything else well they're probably not thinking about anything else within the middle of fighting which is very common with people in military too because the job does require a very focused myopic sense of Drive this is what you need to do especially in the SEAL Teams it's the team comes first team gear personal gear then take care of yourself worry more about the person to your left and to the right and then worry about yourself you know consider the impacts of your actions and your words on the people around you and then on yourself so it's very it is very driven down into a laser-like focus but that's also required to survive and thrive in those environments but if left unchecked you'll end up at the end of your career not prepared for the next phase of your life and say you do 20 years in the military which is what you need to do to get a retirement you join when you're 18 so hey you're 38 well the average lifespan of an American is what 80 85 you go all the time left what are you gonna do if you haven't thought about it it's it's I see guys who struggle I see guys who spend I struggled myself but I think I I think I went through that struggle while I was still in and I think that struggle allowed me to lift my chin up just a little bit to look around and start thinking about the future you're a bad and just um let's wrap this up I don't know about that but let's wrap this up right there cool thanks brother page man all right ladies gentlemen we'd be back tomorrow see ya [Music] [Applause] [Music]
