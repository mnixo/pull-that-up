the girag and experience the karate alright we got to do the karate guy story the street karate guy what happened this is a funny story okay we're at the at the kim bo has to fight and before the fight we go to a temple party those people are there and then these guys these tough guys that there one was I think selling jewelry or something and he was with a bunch of guys and and from the guys I think he was the toughest guy so we're talking and of course you know he didn't know who I was so that was the best thing and the people are talking about fighting and suddenly he comes to fourth and he goes yeah I used to do a karate he says but not normal Claudius to do Street karate I go wow Street karate was or what is that he said well I can tell you one thing that my routine has saved me like six seven times and I go your routine yeah I go okay you you got to show me that routine you know because I would I would love to learn so the guy comes to me and I actually put this in the movie here comes the boom you know that was a true story I and I was long story yeah so the guy comes to me he says first of all I would stand there and then out of the blue I will go so any no no it goes first with this elbow he goes to me he does it to me disclose right boo-boo uh and then he goes oh and he was shaking in front of my face he's serious he's serious he's this close to my face why shaking like this close and my friends everybody is already like almost dying laughing right and then he says and then a moment he's perplexed but I go I go to the neck and then he ought they always do this she said ah it says they grabbed him and now he kept eye contact with me right and he grabs she says I got an DK so he threw knees the body through a ground just like contact with me and you stop shit okay sure I look at him I go now you never did that don't bullshit I say you practice this in the mirror and it looks really cool you never business you know his friends were like they were waiting for my reaction because they were in awe you know this this guy was huh it was his glory and then when at the moment I said total bullshit I started talking and another guy came and say you know he is he was actually professional fighter so the whole group left but the fact the the face the facial expression from all those guys - all dressed the same like this cocky switch shirts over the top all jewelry everywhere you know the those guys exactly expects the street karate guy his routine saved his life seven times you know they tell me they expect that you believe that crap it was the most insane thing I've ever seen and I didn't here comes the boom you remember headbutt knee to the face throw away stomp right victory dance you know and I that I told that the backstage camera for here comes to boom I said this is a true story somebody told me this technique there's a lot of those knuckleheads right those street defense guys they're like fake karate guy and and you know the worst part is they say yeah we cannot use it in the ring because it's way too dangerous yeah I said well that you can kill somebody like this she can also not kill him Yeah right I mean what yeah right I'm kind of control that guy to control your just their techniques are too lethal boss you don't understand like it's like dropping a nuclear explosion on you you know I'm sorry I had the one in spine chill that yeah I love those videos like kung fu videos or guys are demonstrating techniques and how they're gonna work and have you seen the one where the old man who's got this class where he throws like people and then a karate guy note penguins guy comes in and beats the shit out beats the shit out of him and then you see him bleed he see himself he cannot believe it it doesn't work he's trying yeah that one guy he does stick it together goes like this yeah then he goes oh and he makes his somersault and he falls on the ground it's almost like he believed his own bullshit right what are these guys doing they're all faking it they know they are but they're probably it's like mass hypnosis or mass hysteria you know like cult behavior they get locked into believing like I remember when I was in my Taekwondo school was not like cultish in the sense like then nobody had to do anything crazy that and try to get your money or get you to leave your family or anything like that but the devotion that some people had towards the instructor was pretty crazy it's a vision and they didn't exploit it but if someone did exploit it you could see how they could get some weak people that would really fall into it it's it's sort of a disturbing aspect of martial arts that I wanted one of things that I really loved about Brazilian jiu-jitsu was that you didn't kind of see that you didn't see like all the bowing was more like friendly yeah like when I trained with the Machado's like hey my friend oh you okay yeah it was much more yeah once they show you the techniques but they're very friendly and more more like like you know they don't try to place themselves above anyone there's no master they'll because they don't know you because they're gonna let you know that it is really effective right there and the honor the respect that you get from them you'll they'll earn it just by being amazing yeah but but it's because they're good all the other guys who preach and talk about it like that they're not good they suck like every guy who tells me that he is unbelievable he never fought yeah it's full of shit well you know me tell you indeed it's not it's not possible you never he will not know if he can do it under pressure he will not amazing do you know any guys have told me though that they could never lose I can never lose man you don't know I'm I'm I'm Italian I'm in piloting is choked I'm like an animal bro I'm a good wife I go blank and then yeah that's done drop it yeah I go blank enemies eat anything right that's the easiest I had ninjas coming into my class one I I'm not kidding there's a guy walking in with the stash glasses and a big belly red blue-blue kimonos and they came in my engine him in Holland and he walked in there was six girls following him it was like a cult it was the weirdest thing ever later on we found out he couldn't even like eight push-ups it was like bizarre and every time when I would show something they would say something like one time you know I had an armbar and this girl says oh we would bite in the leg you know so I start slowly but surely I figure I'm not going to say anything but then you know it kept going kept going have somebody in the rear naked choke and I said explaining and she goes to somebody else she says we will poke your eyes out now and I go oh excuse me what was that and she said we will poke your eyes out right now I said Wow let's find out I mean I'm gonna try this with you is that cool yeah she goes let's go sit down I said put my arm around her neck I said okay in three seconds I'm going to go if you touch my eye I'm going to break your neck okay let's go because whoa whoa whoa what did you say I said in three seconds we're gonna go I will count down you come near to my fucking eye I'm gonna break your neck okay I should've been there what do you or what do you mean I say okay did you know whatever normally when somebody touches my eye you think I'm gonna go oh no I'm gonna go just up my eye go fuck and I'm gonna go and my eye hurts that face was awesome never never fuck with somebody who has a dominant position over you if I have you in an armbar and you bite my calf guess what's gonna break at that moment is the most idiot thing that people actually believe that if you put a finger of my Ivan 11 life in that situation I'm gonna let go to choke ya really you know I'm gonna snap the neck first then I'm gonna let go to choke well not only that people don't understand how quick you go unconscious like what if someone has a rear naked choke on you especially if you don't really know defense you haven't been choked a lot before you don't know how to relax you know not oh and do you know how hard it is to poke and I yes every heart it's very hard to squeeze my eye I put my my eye against your the back of your neck Becky ahead now what you used to do in bas Rutten is fighting in a sport type situation sure well you got rules see out on the street there are no rules you know and like I cannot fight without rules like I can stab I still only I can do it better more accurate as well I was I used to just well I do this radio show I won't name the guy but there was a guy that they had as their bodyguard and he's a fucking total bullshit artist and he was a fucking do with videos doing nunchucks and shit I don't shoot with his name Master PO so uh Opie and Anthony show and we were on the show once and this I mean I'm fine you know you do whatever you want but as soon as you're on the air and representing you know you I gotta I gotta tell the truth you're on the fucking radio now and people are gonna listen to you and if I let you get away with some nonsense yeah and yeah you look stupid and not not me man some young kid could be listening to that and they want to start a martial art and they get sucked into doing a stupid fucking creats street karate classes yeah cuz and I go listen it's real simple the shit that works on trained killers is the best shit yeah you don't see Anderson Silva you know practicing eye pokes and fucking well although I Polk's are pretty fucking good yes yeah you don't see him doing the you know a death touch and fucking you know pressure point the attacks that shit doesn't work it doesn't work I said on camera we had an email from somebody he said that his master could what point pressure said they could you know knock you out I get a great story but it's also with the mirror anyway I'd looked in the camera I said okay anybody in America you're watching right now if you have a person who kiss who says that he can knock me out with a punch like just pressing somewhere we invite him we pay him we pay his trip he can come on to show we can do it on camera on me he could knock me out I said it's a no-lose situation for me because if it works I'm signing up to do that stuff but I tell you it's not gonna work we had this guy but you know a mirror paresseux you know most everybody we see these guys on stage and the the touch guys right yeah so one guy goes this thick and this was person assists they just fall back and then the guy said did you see his eyes roll back in his skull that means he was hard for real so I got to him here we go this is gonna be fun watch this so these guys they come walking down after the set I said okay do did to me I want you to do it to me you wanted me to coach so you are you sure about that I so do it to me I I you know I want to know how to feels and he goes you know what I could actually I got something better so we already steered away from it right so he says let me show you this and he walks over to his body they start talking to each other and then he walks away and in the corner he stands like this huh like I mean crazy he runs towards his friend then he goes like this fuck in in midair he stops and he flies on the ground so he threw like kung fu jeonghan's I didn't touch him doesn't touch him I go do it I'm sold do that to me right I'm gonna attack you right now so I'm going to the corner and he goes yeah but you have to be really angry I said excuse me yeah really angry otherwise it won't work I say your friend just did it right I say I think I can better act then your friend don't worry I'll be in the zone nobody will he says no no because if you're not real angry it doesn't work it needs to be that balance so I know it was this way out so I walked over to him and I'm standing like this I say kick me into pills and he says what I said kick me I say I'm really fucking pissed he didn't want to do it needless to say I mean but they're idiots that truly believe that is true well it's so easy to take someone who doesn't know anything like who's a student and trick them like that and be a conman like that that's that's you know what the worst thing is there's teachers out there they give you a false sense of security and then you they teach you how to defend a knife you know grabbing the wrist I mean never did I mean this so dangerous knife is dangerous than a gun on a short distance at least they teach him the wrong way and then something happens on the street somebody pulls a knife and he goes to his body dude step back I got it yeah you know I think a kilt Eddie Bravo has a crazy story abandon that guy's fault is this you
