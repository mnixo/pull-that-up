they went they drove by her head up here they drove by three meth labs and a dead hooker just to get to my plane and they're really the funny part of it was the next day we were gonna go somewhere else in in Louisiana and then now I've got a you know just wewe can get rid of that's all we can do because they they might do it again next night next place more dry so now we've got an apple we're smoking out of there two of them on horseback and Alex feeds that one of the horses he's walking by take this is the lab they tried you check your plant again they did check it again but we we just had come up with this little plan that you know we would just would and he also had to eat a little bag of weed and he was really stoned on stage that's really stout but you know we didn't go to jail that night well if you eat just it just eat weed we'll get you are yeah absolutely will it takes a while but it was a big old chaw of it I mean that's a big old bleep full cheek full I'm surprised people don't chew weed like there's no one out there chewing it tastes like ass dude that's which is why nobody easily even the cookies you know they got a they gotta watch it to keep in case there is a growing number of people who juice the leaves and drink it yeah you know like wheatgrass juice they do it with the leaves of cannabis plant I've seen people squeeze it to make their giddy like the concentrate out dude I think they're they're sticking in one of those masticators is that what they called those things that make you know like wheatgrass like yeah yeah they can get juice out of fucking grass it makes sense if you could get it out of I mean if you get it out any plant right it doesn't like getting a CBD out there what's the point for health Ron oh yeah you know it's like O'Doul's pot Oh to tell you what's not bad the Heineken shit that we got we have Heineken zero zero or whatever the fuck it is it does not taste bad it's no no alcohol in it no taste so you don't get that annoying buzz yeah you cuz how you guys had that soccer sober October and it looked like you were having a blast I have to admit sitting from the sidelines there cowboy the sober thing looks like a blast and that I did have but November to remember yeah we had no remember November yeah sober October is interesting it's good to do every year I like to do it you think you'd ever do it yeah I don't think I could not how many days you think you take off you know really not one and be very happy about it I've got a little touch of alcoholism that someday I'll need to deal with her I won't but you know it's it's a maintenance thing with me so a maintenance as far as keeping your mindset correct just feeling good like what is it yeah you know it's just not give a fuck juice I don't know it's just something that I seem to require you know it's like I can't wait for that first drink of the day and then I usually drink you know pretty much to access every single night of my life so I mean I'm not saying this is a good thing and I'm certainly not bragging because I see people that are sober and I get jealous of them I'm like wow what would that be like to you know wake up feeling good every day and I'm so committed to it I don't understand that I mean I don't stand why I won't just let it go but it's you know I know it's such a big part of you know who who who people perceive me to be but it's also just a big part of how I perceive me to be well people who perceive you to be they perceive you like if anyone has ever asked me what's wrong white like I go what do you think he's like oh great guy likes to drink a lot always funny yeah that's him that's you you have the benefit of you don't have an act like you're not putting on an act but you are a character like you do that but as who you are it's so much better like if people found out you were some teetotal and got like if you ever seen someone who drinks fake shots on stage yeah yeah that's rough that's a rough place to be yeah pretending to be boozing it up with a dad come on well you know Brooks who was the best I he'd foster Brooks was so good at being a drunk was a teetotaler Dean Martin as well not as he told me but you know I don't think so and I hear that but I've you know I've seen him oh my when I did the Foxworthy roast I went back and watched all those roasts yeah and that guy was drunk and if you don't watch movies he was in he was not a good actor so it was acting and him and frost to foster Brooks were in the same one and Brooks was just so good and so edgy and but you could tell which one was really drunk and but I think a lot of times in Vegas he might have had fake drinks and you know or maybe people just wanted to say that because it's a little story right yeah but he looked like a you know looked like he was fucked up to me have you seen that show on I don't know if you watch any Amazon Prime you ever seen that show the marvelous mrs. Mazal it's about a stand-up comic no I see I hear about it all the time when people are always saying it's really really good it's fucking great it's fucking what I just finished something today so I'm looking for the next watch that man especially season 1 season 1 just to season 2 is great - I enjoyed it but people didn't give season 2 as much reward as much props as they did I liked both seasons but there's a woman in that it was my point who has an she's putting on an act like she's this really highfalutin lady who pretends to be this chick from Queens and she puts on a fat suit and does this act and it drives mrs. Mazal fucking crazy she hates it and she talks shit about her and it starts out at spoiler alert I won't say any more but it just that trap of being a character right pretending to be something that you're not I you know I think that's and this might be a little a stress Joe I don't know but you know the I think that's why Steve Martin quit because he was a parody of a comedian and which was brilliant and and so funny I let's get small was one of my favorite albums never and I took it with me everywhere I went and played it for people and then took credit for how good it was even though I really had very little to do with it except for spending the money I remember when I was a kid I listened to that long before I ever did stand-up he was fucking great then right goddamn he was great but he was doing forty five thousand people a night would even when he quit yeah I think that was the problem I think he just got over he I think he's like a lot of comedians they feel a lot you know the nut numb people they feel a lot I think for him like this every day why I'm very good I know how to get in touch with those features everybody that's damaged feels a lot and everybody the comic is damaged you know what I think I got with that I think with Steve Martin he was just so big man I don't think I think he's bigger than you or I combined like he just would go onstage and they would go fucking crazy didn't you make sense to people and they're all so difficult for him to perform what was fun anymore and yeah so I think I mean it was a ballsy thing to do fucking crazy and but and then he walks straight into film and you know everything he's done has been crazy crazy successful no he's he's excellent and I'd love to go see the band my Kathy Nelson went you know Kathy runs the tour thing she would see the band and went back and talked to him said it was great Wow I'd like to meet him he lived if we lived in the same town for a while and I'd like to meet him but never ran into him ran into Jonathan winters there a couple of times what was he like he was holding court at the post office and it's 20 people around he's doing character he's killing at the post offices well I sorry that was the second time I saw him the first time I saw him was that he was having lunch by himself and and I was with another comic and he goes do you think he'd mind if we went over there and said hi an hour later we're like well we gotta go it was Robins big influence right right yeah that's uh yeah that's true yeah he was so zany he was so Zen who the fuck was like him think of that he had had to start with something right that's how I got I got this theory that there's two kinds of comics bridge builders and people that walk across those bridges mmm I'm a big Walker yeah I didn't even bring any of this stuff I think well you gotta go back to like Richard Pryor and Lenny Bruce those are the big ones and then Kennison Kennison because Kennison taught us that somebody can genuinely not like you yeah and you can still make a lot yeah he also taught me that you can punch down as low as you want as long as it's funny right as long as funny as long as your goodness that fucking bit that he had about starving children to this day I had an argument with a guy on the podcast about it where he was telling me that you you comedy only punches up I go that's crazy Kinnison had two of the best bits of all time they were both punching down one was about starving kids the other was about necrophiliac money corpses but that just down is you get me a fucking body right there and both those bits were fucking genius and it's the same with is same with 9/11 you know if you're good enough of a writer yeah you can do material about that but if you but if but you better be good you better have somewhere to go that yeah you better have somewhere to go and I heard a couple of good pieces I don't remember who did them but you know but like the week afterwards the guy that it was some guy that was the opening act was trying to riff on it and I got him over the side and I said hey dude not this is my stage right here normally I don't tell it to comics what to do but until you have something to say about it that's that's really really funny I don't want you bringing it up yeah that's that's a tough one because you could kill the whole show some middle act goes on and you lost friends in the towers and that was a week ago all right I mean that there's like levels of tragedy that's a real tough one to find humor in I'm not saying that someone can't do it there's people people find comedy and everywhere and it's legit they do right there it's just the I you know how good are you to avoid those things that's how good I am I get it I get it I'm not good enough to do it Patrice O'Neal had a really great point about that he's like all things when someone's trying to be funny they all come from the same place just some of them miss some of them just aren't funny you can't get mad at those right they came from the same place like yeah I bet someone would admit that they told a joke that wasn't funny whoops tried right but they're not trying to be mean like the the response sometime right it just didn't work yeah it just sucks but you know you when someone's ad-lib and some things are gonna suck but the response sometimes to one that's like uh off you know it'll maybe a little bit too harsh or maybe a little too soon like people get so fucking mad all right well you sent me a tweet about that Cosby bit that I did and it was really funny and but it it just stirred the pot so much well you you think rapist could no that's not what I said at all that's not what I said at all I made a joke that's it and and you do that - I mean you stir up the pot big time it's great and you'll just go watch this and have a point though and if you have a point and you really are trying real hard to be a good person you just have a point I just have a point on things I'm gonna say it no you might you might get mad but I'm not saying it to be a bad guy I'm saying excessive what I do for a living so I do thought we find things you know burr was telling me that he did Caroline's in New York City was like it was almost like a college gig he's like people are so sensitive now in New York oh you know he and I just did the VFW hall in Hollywood and then the and I was calling him about another comic that I wanted I was just talking to the bar I thought he was really funny and I now can't remember his name Joe DeRosa so Terrell says yes and I called him and he goes yeah no he's really good and and he goes how about I come over and do it I'm like what course bill whatever you want to do time I wanna come on over well he was doing a bunch of throw up stuff and and you know Minh and I guarantee and my fans are pretty split down the middle but it did not go over well and he didn't give a Fiddler's fuck about it and so he just made a mad stirred about for about a minute and then we both did my set we smoked a cigar and he you know he's not drinking either for another like a year or so yeah it looks great he looks really good he looks thin and healthy yeah yeah yeah the Trump jokes are interesting because I don't remember anybody getting mad at you for Bush jokes right it's Derrida's jokes right yeah yeah even if you were like a bush supporter you could crack a joke about the way he spells potato or something like then nobody gave a fuck I didn't care it was a different thing even if people were simply ambushed by the way that spell potato wrong oh that's right Wales Quayle that's right that's right that's how these rumors get started man against yeah you conspiracy dudes over here blowing off this who spelled potato wrong shit oh that's right it was him um Bush fucked some things up too though didn't he well there's a whole album like the wit and wisdom of George W Bush he says like fool me once shame on you yes shame on me again I don't know you know what's interesting about Bush is when he was running for governor of Texas he had a completely different way of communicating he talked like a really smart guy he's very articulate I mean he was a smooth smooth talker like I read good ww there's a video of him but from back in the day when he was running for governor and he's great you listen to him I glue this energetic intelligent guy's articulate he seems like one of us and then there's they had a side-by-side video comparing him to like Bush after seven years in office he's barely hanging on as I pay attention to shit he's given the reins to heaven and hell to Dick Cheney Dick Cheney's in a bunker seven miles underground making the various decisions you know I mean it was weird it was a weird time but you can make fun of Bush all day long nobody give a fuck you make fun of Trump today people want to kill you I almost got into scuffle the other day at the gas station this guy just starts spouting out stuff he was putting gas in his car right over there and in just and by the first words the sentence that came out of his mouth from nowhere and said a word of the guy didn't say hi to him nothing Nancy Pelosi said dumbest person that ever lived on this planet and and and I get baited so easy I just said probably not probably not that you're probably wrong probably not Obama was an idiot they graduated number one from Harvard Law so yeah views politically aside we can start with he's probably not stupid and what a good speaker he was the best guy was smooth the most presidential he was he was a guy that you were happy to have represent you whether you believe with his you know believe in him and you support his ideas or not as a representative of our culture of our civilization that guy was smooth and measured and articulate and and off the book you know it most of the time it you know he was just he was saying what he thought he wasn't reading off of scripted well you want the story about Clinton being off the book Clinton was such a good orator that the teleprompter went off it broke like five minutes into his fucking speech and he did all that shit by memory you see the whole goddamn thing by memory and I played nine holes of golf with him was he like and it was well there's still security Secret Service all around him right and so it was a private golf course Larry Ellison that owns Oracle Oh owns this private golf course it has 14 he's a big tennis guy so he puts on the tennis stuff out in Palm Springs and nobody plays this course and he doesn't play golf and it's just as private as is the deal his own course get his yeah he's got his own course he played through our group and Shadow Creek and Beverly Hill I mean in in Vegas a really exclusive course impossible to get on and and he was playing by himself and he was gone the tea box and I said it's lonely at the top in hilarion he goes yeah I went off by himself and but he went even there but but Clinton was and he told me a story goes his friend of his is a record producer rap records big I didn't tell me who it was and didn't tell me who the artist was either but the artist was all dug down he was in a Ferrari store and and the salesman he goes are you thinking about buying this car and the guy goes no I'm gonna buy the car I'm thinking about pussy the Clinton told me a story that had the word pussy in it Clinton told me that that's a great fucking story that is a great story that poor bastard it's almost like a comic like he could just be free yeah he was like you think if he got divorced and just started going on the honest Bill Clinton I fucked her yeah I did I didn't want to either what would you do what would you do you're in my position what would you do you're smart you know you don't got but 40 years left to live how to shove my pecker right in her mouth that's what the whole idea of being the fucking number one guy you got to be so goddamn pussy hungry to want to be the number one hundred percent you gotta have big appetites that's for sure for everything yeah for everything for everything that'll be a super conqueror yeah and all those guys are seeing I'm not all those guys I don't want to generalize but it but it's really really common for men that are in power positions to just be horny as fuck yeah of course I mean we got to go back with the way we want these people to behave is so contrary the way any king ever behaved ever in history like the stories of kings throughout history was always decadence it was always you know all these women one food more food you know feeding a vast open sores and cutting off the fucking ex-wives heads and shit that's what you think of ordering armies people protecting them it's like those people were just gluttons today the super gluttons of the world right and we don't like that like so then we try to turn someone into some fucking Norman Rockwell person right and that doesn't work either it's not you don't have enough you don't you you don't have enough charisma to lead yeah maybe you know Trump is showing us that like you could talk shit about him 24/7 365 days a year he's not adjusting anything in fact he digs his heels in he's the same fucking guy no matter what happens well you know I I really don't like to get into month row because it and the reason is I just don't feel like it's my job I feel like it's your job yeah my job is different you know my job is to go up there and just you know make them laugh and but I don't want to be divisive yeah here you know I just don't want to do it because it's my fanbase is split and you know I've had and you know nothing ever really happens but I had a guy one time because I said something to meet and greet who is paid to take a picture of me and then refuse to take a picture of me because of what I said and I'm like I don't give a fuck you know take a picture leave that I don't give a shit touching yeah but you know that's also one of the it's like they're exerting power over you I'm not even take picture I'm gonna unfollow you on Instagram to Ron White right goddamn communist yeah what am I gonna do yeah I thought one girls you said I'm now I'm gonna in file you used to be funny but now you're just filthy and I'm gonna unfollow you and I know it doesn't matter I said you can't leave all the plants will die whenever you're in a bind quote Bill Murray yeah people are just so mean just want to hurt you run white for no reason yeah but nobody I've already been as mad as I can be mmm and I'll never be matter and it happened when I was 16 years old so it's hard to make me mad and I'll tell you what made me mad I just got my driver's license my mother asked me to go to the store to get something it's in the summer in Houston I don't have any shoes on oh my doorstep into a shitty Pampers that somebody just thrown in the parking lot and my VIN it and I didn't just put a toe in and go oh that's baby shit that's wrong I just shoved my whole foot into a dream baby shit coming through my toes smears all over the diaper right so I'm stuck I don't know what to do I'm not gonna get back in my mother's car with this shitty foot I can't go into the store with baby shit all over my foot and I thought about just cutting my foot off and just leaving it in the diaper with a note that said used to be a perfectly good fucking foot dude and nobody's ever made me that mad sense I was so fucking furious and I just wanted to hate and kill but over a shitty pamper that's crazy that was all it took that's all it took that's all it took but it was sold hey you know it just put me in a I I've been stuck before it let me tell you about the other time I was stuck this will get us off of politics I'm in my tour bus and I'm partying with my buddy Steve my best friend my road manager who passed away and and he never gets laid but it looked like he had an angle on this girl so I picked him up here and went back to my bedroom which I never do I set up there and dreams with the guys and I go back there just to go to sleep but I never take booze back there or anything but I'd gone back there and laid down and I put that Dos Equis bottle on the counter and then we took off during the night while I was real drunk and Steve was real drunk and the bottle falls off brakes I don't hear it so in the middle of the night my bed sits high because you want to try to get those beds towards the center the because it's on those axles anyway but the closer it is to the center the better it feels when you're in it so you kind of slide off of it about an inch and I my foot went into a the bottom of the beer bottle that a shard hanging off of it about an inch and a half long and and I just and I landed on it well now I know exactly what it was and and somebody had hit the master lights so I can't turn the lights on you have to go back and turn them on on the master switch but I know that around me is broken glass everywhere because I understand what happened I understand that bottle fell broke and I got it in my foot so I pulled my foot up and I didn't know how big the shard was and I just pulled it out of their blood just starts gushing out well Steve's passed out in the bunk and he can't hear me I can't get to a phone I can't see so what do I do I just crawl back in bed went to sleep and bled when and Steve said the next morning I look like somebody killed a hog in there and he has lifted up the sheets even the bus driver saw my foot and they're like eyes all right mister Christ did you did you worry about bleeding out cuz the only option was to take another step and cut the other foot and you have your phone with you I wasn't within reach I was just stuck yeah and I was also drunk right stuck and drunk and bleeding that's a good combination yeah yeah I was stumped I didn't know what to do I didn't know how to fucking combat it so I would just crawl back and pad and I'm like what was your foot thirteen stitches as soon as I woke up and looked at him let's call the hospital guys and then sewed it back up thirteen on the bottom of my foot right in the arch and it was a you know it was it was mess it was about good man every time if you fuck your foot up you realize how much you need them like you can fuck your shoulder up and that sucks but yeah but you shall walk somewhere and get something yeah when your foot up you're like oh okay this is this is a real problem any operation or something right I play foot every play golf every day so oh yeah it was a real problem with a real problem me yeah every day every day I can't not every day but every day I can golf is one of those games man guys just get fucking into golf yeah it's you know it's you know look at what you're into you know that it it it's something that you do and you've always done and and you just you just keep doing it you know I've watched it on television like it's a so pop right as watched 80 hours of the players it also gives me a reason not to exercise you know cuz I got this golf to watch it yeah well it golf does give you some exercise though that's a fact you are walking rather than being sedentary yeah you're walking around and you're thinking you know you plan and shit out looking at the curves of that thinking grass and measuring that yeah we're trying to work out solve problems and so I get it I'm just terrified terrified I'll be one of you guys out there every day yeah alright now I know five friends that go out every day you probably one of them other guys I do too every time they get a chance the guys I play with you every day yeah if you can pull it off it's like a gentlemen's leisure way of life yeah you know it's always back when I was a club comic that's how I killed the day guy start playing when I was like 13 and so I would just go to a golf course and you know she moves out a deal where I could play golf there every day and you need jack shit to do during the day in clubs for 15 years right you know I'm doing 48 weeks and I'm making 500 a week or whatever it was when I started and you know as a middle act out there you had to work them all you know because you needed the $500 real bad yeah do you ever look back on those days look like you reminisce you know what I it it's a good thing for me that this was the path of least resistance right because isn't no one forced and up I'd be a regional marijuana distributor in the state of Texas and in an industry that has some questions coming up so you know I did it because I loved that but it was also fun fun fun you know and and and it was easy for me I didn't mind the travel because I like drinking free and bars and and and and you know you know practicing this art form and you know and I but I never ever thought it would you know go where it went you know if people asked me how do I do that I'm like a fire while I did it and that was right there when it happened I have no idea I barely remember it did you live in Mexico for a little bit mm-hmm in fact there's a really really really good PGA player from the same town I lived in that played golf every day where I played golf I didn't know him as young he would have been a let's figure it out and would he would have been he's like 21 or two now and he was at he was on them in the heat for this tournament he was Abraham answer is his name and born and Reynosa Mexico way they actually born across the border because there's no wall right they just come over there have a baby so that and but his parents must have been fairly well-off for that part of the world you know did to do that but he's great he's great not dig it because I you know and I see where he came from exactly you know it's where my son made a hole-in-one what was 8 years old was on the compensatory golf course and Reynosa Mexico I mean holds and one does the guy get in his career I've had one my sons had one you know like the big guys maybe 16 17 18 there's a whole pie in a whole lifetime there's no equivalent in other sports yeah everyone there's no equivalent in any other game right there was a double eagle the what's that mean that's where you make a two on a par five so that means you suck a hole from 260 to 262 yards out you made it on the second shot oh wow there's very rare oh very rare but there's still a double eagles slightly less rare than a hole one way less reckless way less rare because a hole because that par-3 could be as much as a hundred and twenty-five yards you know and then most of them are made on the longer 185 but you know you're not guys like me aren't hitting the par 3 from you know 235 you have you think about it I guess there's nothing like that in any other game or sport hole-in-one where it just works out perfect maybe you'll walk off grand slam or yeah maybe way more often yeah way more well yeah way more often than the hole-in-one for how many people try yeah you know you don't get many chances at that right Grand Slam but I'm gonna try to have anything make pitch at you you're definitely gonna hit the ball it's right there like that golf ball is just right there I mean you might not have a good lay but you're definitely gonna hit it my saying on the right yeah well yeah well if you hit a foul ball you got to play it you gotta go find it yeah it's just it seems like the odds of you getting a hole-in-one must be off the charts it must be like a thousand to one or a hundred thousand to one or something crazy like that yeah maybe I mean most people maybe never you know what do you think the numbers numbers would be what are the odds I'll fuck your hole-in-one I think let's throw the math to those carb guys yes my son made one the 11th day ever played golf in front of me and his coach and his best friend and no and it was a 95 yard par 3 from the regular women's tees with the u.s. Kids Club a driver that I still have Wow and and it just straight at the hole he had a crate golf swing kids if you tree tomorrow you know his golf coach was good even though they spoke a different language they understand Golf and how to teach him that swing and so he was good at it and he didn't really play much anymore it's not his thing but it slanted ten yards in front of the pin bounced wise roller right in the middle of Cup and I know at this point I've been playing golf for thirty years and I'd never done it and so it was a big deal and he got his name in a couple of newspapers and they mentioned him on the Golf Channel he was a youngest kid that had made a hole-in-one that year that was registered and then like two weeks later a six-year-old hit since I was like you know they took all the joy out of it for him yeah that was one kid he was lucky he hit his win on off a mailbox you're you're winning off a perfect golf shot golf shot that's a hard thing to learn right that swing yeah you know it is a really difficult thing to do and it's it's just a it's a thing that you learn how to aim it's like a bow and arrow you know even though that's a little easier to teach somebody how to do but to do it exceptionally well you know it's a it's it's not easy to do hmm and and or a slingshot how to get the power at the right spot or or even fly casting it's not power everywhere it it's power in the right spot yeah that was it and limp of the wrists yeah and so it's it's it's hard to do but it's fun to do once you once you once you learn how to hit a good solid golf shot yeah and the ball comes off the way as opposed to it's you know it's bliss I'll tell you something here's here's a story about golf my best friend who passed away died of brain cancer so they had done a surgery on him that had just down scars down his neck down his back where they were trying too hard they were you know they were shooting it you know he was already you know he had it should have had a death sentence we just weren't saying it out loud and we were at my place in Montecito and we had thrown everything at this cancer but the kitchen sink and we were looking for the fucking sink you know and and it Steve goes let's go a golf course man he goes I'll help you read some putts he was always good at reading putts we've been playing golf since we were little we've known each other since we were six and and so when I got my clubs out his clubs were in there too so he reaches into his pill bag and takes another pill of pain pill and said I've thrown mine on there right you know I might take a swing so and he did off the first tee box and it hurt and it wasn't very good and and and he just winced and but every once in a while he'd put a ball down and hit it and when we get to the 17th holes part 367 yards long oh and he hits his drive with his with his driver and and it fades off a little bit the right but he caught it and so it was up kind of by the world by the green but the pin was kind of on the other side and I was like great you know that and and so he hits a chip shot which is easier to do and he's always really been good at that and he hits it to about 7 feet and I'm like oh my god he's got a 7-foot putt for a par and he makes it and this dying man gets the biggest grin I've ever seen in my life and it was crooked because his muscles had been cut but it just brought him pure fucking joy and then I got to see the last party everybody so and I got to witness that you know joy so that's awesome that's pretty cool that's golf you know okay you know if it means that much to you you know it could make you feel better if you do it right one that I get it I think it's like in any difficult game like that i guess it would be like that with a lot of games but there's something about golf too that it's very physical and you're doing it outside it's one of the only things you have to do outside you know other than I guess you could do tennis inside like really right but Golf is a fucking giant ass course you're gonna be walking gotta go outside yeah okay I do it in a golf cart but you know I walk I walk from the golf cart to the ball going on going on but you got to stay loose you know that's why that's the only reason I do yoga is is to keep my lower back and my you know keep everything moving around and yeah well it's just got it's all got to turn you know around your spine and that you know I'm 62 years old and and so that's just you know harder to do and then unless you keep you know you got to keep those muscles stretched out yeah to be able to do it at all yeah I think it's like that with uh anything where you're moving your body as a unit martial arts stuff anything you better let see as you get older in particularly you better be really aware of all the moving parts when you're a kid you can just fucking hit the gas when you hit 50 you better be you know you're swinging up tennis racket or something like that you better be aware of your shoulders and your knees yeah where of all these moving parts how old are you 51 51 little wait wait wait 462 I'm not waiting what's up here's tiger and tigers back injury for back surgeries oh no he had another one like this isn't like yesterday or anything was from oh okay you're - oh good wise announced that he had undergone anterior lumbar interbody fusion oh that's fusing his dicks many thought many thought his discs many thought that his competitive golf career was over in his fourth surgery since March of 2014 which involved removing the l5 s1 intervertebral disc fusion material to connect the l5 and s1 vertebrate wats oh my god although he's apparently recovered quite well from the operation the surgery is quite rare amongst professional golfers one of the PGA player Dudley Hart had also had had a fusion in the same location as Woods fucking fusions rough man that means there's no disk left right and he won the that whatever they call the FedEx Cup the last tournament of the year you know last year Tiger won it and so he came back from that that's incredible oh it is amazing and I was there is that East Lake in Atlanta and and I do all their all their charity stuff yeah that's the footage of him going up to 18th green he's about to win this thing and it's this is the the top 30 golfers in on the PGA Tour which is the toughest tour there is there's all these people jazz now you're in sport that everybody gets to run on the field and follow him right walk right next to him there's no crowd control there I was right up there I was right up there above this green because i-i've walked with because I get to go inside the Rope so and I followed it a couple of fuckin choked that he didn't matter this is the one he needs right here the short set yep yeah they get a two-shot lead going into that and that's it and they want anyone the whole thing yeah that was the comeback you know that was the comeback that people said would never happen that he never did not especially at this level that's a hard tournament to win I mean that's a that's tough tough slop mmm back Tigers back Tigers back that love um the require a lot from people you know if if they get some strange along the way that guys he's he got it rough after his whole divorce and sex scandal he had raw for a long time people were coming after him but the thing is about those back surgeries is I wonder why they did the fusion because I think they do articulating discs now it seemed to be very effective at you know I think he tried I'm we have to get Boyett for so because people are that are doing those they've got those discs down they put like a titanium moveable disc basically takes the place of the disc that's in the in your back Eddie Bravo had that done was it yeah I play all these uh okay programs increased offers performance via an anterior approach is that it spares the large muscles of the back that are critical to golf swing which potentially makes the recovery for athletes athletes a bit easier but I would imagine whoever was looking at Tigers back about the best person in the world to be looking at it so I'm sure they would he had a pretty big budget for it yeah I mean you would want I mean they must have like really calculated it thought was what the best move was maybe um if they put an artificial disc you would move funny I'm good I don't know man that hold the back things rough one you ever had any back problems I don't have a lot of any kind of problems except a little alcohol thing that I got going a little squeaker and and but I play golf with guys in these programs and most of them are you know football basketball players and most of them around my age and most of them are in pain you know they would it turns out smoking pot watching cartoons good for your knees yes my refine and I just didn't get hurt you know I didn't I played golf when I was on the golf team yeah I sucked but I was on the golf team and junior high in high school and football too but life of relative leisure is good for the joints right it's good from where I'm laying it yeah the fucking the knees and the ankles we were talking to Camaro Guzman yesterday who's UFC welterweight champion he's at five knee surgeries both of his knees are basically bone on bone can't run anymore I had all kinds crazy out and you still fight then of destroy these people with no doesn't just fight he destroys people he's the best he just beat tyron woodley who was the best before him it's fucking crazy I mean when I laughed so hard when a guy goes my balls got hot you go there was the best come the best thing you could have possibly service I understand love that guy Lewis is he's a he's a genius he figured out a way to be himself he forgot his Instagram page no no yeah if there's anything fuckin crazy going on the world Derek Lewis has on Instagram page his Instagram page is the best people found out about it I gave him a shout-out to his Instagram page on one of the UFC broadcasts and now it's got like what does he have how many followers you have an island 0.6 miles 1.6 million it's that good though it's fucking chaos he always gets videos deleted and removed but apparently they leave them up there I mean they're not threatening to take them down I don't think I hope not every it's where I go to take a look at it any fucking dummy that's trying to like like light a bomb under a tire and fly through the air and smash the roof of a fucking garage with his face he's got all that shit motorcycle accidents or people trying to do wheelies and they fall it lands on them anything fucked up on the internet Dare funny he's got it all anything crazy just fucking he's a hilarious guy but the fact that he could say something like that you know like he starts selling t-shirts afterwards my balls is odd t-shirts so they don't I got one I don't think real people listen to anything that's being said about I need one of those shirts I mean I need one of those shirts please Derek oh my god this is your character fight his ass off to Saudi what what I know it's your show but what how many fights do you do now and does anybody care about a fight you don't announce Javed first super care yeah I do ten a year ten year ten events a year I'm doing like the big paper views like yeah there's a lot of them that are overseas but they want you to be the voice right it's done all the time and all the time with all with the podcast and with doing stand-up and you know making Netflix specials and shit right no time right now I know there's I like it better when I do it once a month like what's like 10 times years basically once a month or I like I like that better because it seems like that's um and it's the higher profile stuff I don't mind though there's a lot of fights that are not that high profile that it looks like they're crosby Stills and Nash and you're young you just pop in and do the big shows and that's funny people you know ya hear as much I love geminate man I love doing it I still do but it's it's amazing to me how many people that I'm me cuz I talk about you and I'm proud I love our friendship and I but I really want to hear you a lot and I admire you for a lot of reasons but one of them is that you're famous for a lot of things and some people don't know you is all of those things I don't know if anybody does well probably because they listen to the podcast and there's millions of them but still that I don't think you know I don't think is this common for people to know how good a comedian you are you know of course they don't unless they've seen you you know live because they might think of you as the guy from The Fear Factor or the or the man show or or UFC and you're famous for all those things and stand-up comedy that's a that's that's crazy but i but i but I find myself defending you sometimes going listen to his fucking stand up go watch turn on Netflix and watch that last special watch all of them there it's really really good stuff he's one of the only people that really makes me laugh and and and I feel like I'm out here spreading the word you got a podcast it reaches the entire universe and I'm explaining Joe Rogan to people so listen I love you and I appreciate you so you saying that to me means lots of it thank you well that's anyway baby shit all over my fucking foot I'm saying is it and I'm not over it I'm just not over it it's a good thing to be angry if you're gonna have one bad moment in your life that's a fucking that's a mountain jacquard you couldn't hose it off your foot right fine there's no O's that's what I'm trying to say I can't it was Nance there was no house I get it it was no fucking house I get it so what would've been stuck if there would have been a hose that was in the parking lot of a grocery store Jimmy will be telling me that Conor McGregor was mad at me for something will be saying I could pull up the video I guess what was he doing is that illegal we allowed to say what do you say something like a script I talk off script on script or we call fights on his good dad really true cuz no one ever gives me a script that's fact I mean I don't know what exactly said but maybe just didn't like my commentary I bet he likes it when he wins right you know you had his picture and you're right here in the what do you call this place in the studio the actual quote is I'd like him to call a fight how he sees it correctly instead of reading off a script though well that's that's that's a you know that's his perception I understand what he's saying you know sometimes people think that but you know it's very difficult when someone's calling your fight if he's talking about me calling someone's fight that's not his friend then that makes much more sense it's fucking hard man it's hard for me it's I have a really hard time calling friends fights it's fucking hard I don't you know I don't know him that well but I like him a lot I respect he's fun to watch him fight that's for sure do me play it yeah sure go ahead play nice flavor MacGregor without black line same way is too so he's talking about they must ask you to do the podcast yeah I get his position uh you know that Diaz fight was good fucking fight man was a hard fight I wasn't calling it like the last fight but I had to call it with the knowledge of the last fight I had to know what happened in the last fight in the last fight Diaz survived the storm tagged him had him rocked and then finished him on the ground it doesn't mean that he didn't win the second fight it was close fucking fight the second if I was a very close fight but you have to acknowledge that that other fight took place he also said it like with a smile I think that guy is one of the most dynamic individuals to ever compete in the sport he's a special person very special person very unusual guy even if he doesn't beat khabib ever again or you know he loses to this guy loses to the Floyd Mayweather who cares he's still one of a fucking billion human being he's an unusual guy the amount of electricity how fucking good man he starched Jose hey Aldo is one of the greatest featherweights if not the greatest next to max Holloway of all-time starched him with one punch when Aldo was Aldo Aldo was the fucking man I mean he was the man he was smashing everybody for years and Conor talked so much shit to him and climbed so deep inside his head and infuriated him to the point we were so emotional and he came charging at Connor and Connor just slipped back and Bank dropped like the best one punch knockout in the history of the sport oh no shit Oh hundred percent because it was so significant there was so much hype behind it it was a guy we're like how good is this guy is this guy really the next big thing or is he gonna fall apart when he meets a real champion like Aldo and then he knocks him out with one fucking punch but it was crazy and then hammer fist annoys out when he's on the ground him was definitive fourteen seconds of the first round he throws a hopping sidekick he's gauging the distance he's got like this karate stance and then he sees Jose a load up here you could watch it right here he sees Jose a load up and when he sees Jose a load up he he had this fight one guy I play he had this fight won even before I mean he knew how it was gonna go down he knew what aldo was gonna do he was real emotional and angry so he knew he's gonna come forward so he's gauging his distance my pain see that BAM I mean that was like one of the most spectacular shows in the history of the sport because it had so much meaning to it it was so important it was for the featherweight championship of the world Connor had already won the interim title him and Aldo facing each other this big hype thing took a year to put together crazy so that he's awesome did you call that oh yeah yeah I think the only time I've ever yelled out he slept him when someone got cracked I don't even know why I said it just like that's that's what came to my head it just I just yelled it out he said that's that's what he did he slept him I saw that special about that guy who announces for world wrestling or professional wrestling the guy will take the snake yeah no you got to be announced oh I'm sorry which guy Jim Ross you know he's got real bad PTSD and he's corrupt but he's a great he's a star and that was it's a book but some a documentary that I saw and I can't remember the guys name when they do it and in 20 minutes I would still not remember the guys name hmm but it was it was great and he's really good I mean they sought after for big events he does all their big events or there he did and then he's like fall off into a this crazy de precios thing and then they didn't he'd come back and you know it was it was a great story I wish I could think of it I would think you'd know who that was mara Oh was it more oh yeah yeah more one oh yeah more oh does a Showtime boxing - what's that is that your phone run is that your phone did sings back in black yeah I think the special is called bipolar rock and roller yeah yeah and Mauro's been on the pike test for he's a buddy okay he's a great announcer a really really nice guy too but yeah he suffers from mental illness and he does a really good job of talking about it and making sure that other people know this is not something that you should be ashamed of you know let's go message for my son okay love you dad oh he does that in the middle of nowhere for no girl that's awesome man Rob white getting some love but yeah more more oh is he used to do pride he's the pride commentary he's done a lot of boxing he did Showtime boxing he does WWE he's done a bunch of an MMA shit too you know a bunch of different organizations I think he even did glory for a while he does Bellator - that's right he does Bellator he's a really good guy yeah mental illness is a weird one man you walk away from it from Washington documentary a fan you know go even if you don't know anything about it I love wrestling when I was a kid and I was a big wahoo McDaniels fan was Wahoo McDaniel came up during the Bob Backlund days yeah this is it's Kay he was a Dallas Cowboy at one time he was from Midland Texas and he was Cherokee Indian and oh yeah look at him and he look like a comedian a regular like shaky green or somebody looks like yeah who does he look like so he would he would come out now I this is the first my first encounter with my first encounter with the bracket that is what it's buddy hackett yeah so I my cousin who's a few years older than me I'm visiting my relatives up in this little town north of Amarillo and so we go down to al 660 miles down to Amarillo and he's going to take us to the Sportatorium to watch the super inferno who I hated I mean this is on the local television all over the you know taxes than they and and they but one of the stops was there than and and so we win that I had and I don't think I'd been to one yet it was my first one and and I loved Wahoo McDaniel cuz he gets out there and just he comes back from anything right yeah you think he's out of it out of it he just he is amazing and fun and you know I just loved him loved him look and and I hated the super inferno because he was like rushing or something hit on you know something that they would it was easy you know to hate because we were all the propaganda we were getting about Russia it was like their women are ugly I'm like no they're not you know it took me a while it was like it was all like Pittsburgh because we talked so bad about my relatives about Pittsburgh because they hated the Steelers and I just had this image of Pittsburgh of this dark cloudy people bent over gray in the face and yeah first time I drove into Pittsburgh I was like like this place is gorgeous look at this place it's a blast it's a great place to perform oh yeah yeah it's always you know it's always been a big big stop for me I mean once I got out of the club's yeah Pittsburgh's great Cleveland's another one that's very underrated yeah Cleveland's fucking towers had a blast playing they didn't prop that in the flats man and that did a bar right there in the parking lot it was like man this is one-stop shopping right for around white how many of what dates you doing a year these days 110 cities last year and then and then I you know and then I'd try to do sets when I'm in town and and the and I should do more you know I got a nice is it to have a store though you know it's great yeah I went to the memorial and Brody's yeah and you know I'd like to just tell your listeners that you never know when it's going to be the last time you see somebody so don't ever ever hesitate to say I'm gonna need that money you're gonna write you can't do it later from their mother you know you can't do that it's a very good point that so don't forget that every time I saw it Brodie I gave him a hug that's one thing the protein and I always have him caught with always always every single time I saw Brody I've gave him a big hug like he's a big hugger yeah yeah you know I only knew him as a brother you know you know I feel important feel like it's important to me to be a part of the comedy community you know participate in it you if you're out there and you're a comedian and you want to be a comedian you can be a comedian but you got to go be a comedian yeah and you got to do it every day yeah you know every you know for the most part I know you're the same way I mean I know that you'd never pass up an opportunity to get behind the microphone whether it says eight or ten million people to listen to this or there are 65 people and whatever doesn't matter that matter to me you got to do it all all the time I saw way to do it right all the time you lose the touch with the reality of it and also its pace rhythm could be in and how comfortable you are in any situation you know this situation is just me and you talking or 26 people I play The Laughing Skull in Atlanta the 65 people sold out it's one of the hottest rooms I've ever had my hands I love that joint in that cool place did that place a couple years ago yeah that was my hang when I lived out there what a great place to practice yeah oh it was it was great it's a great staff - it's like a they're like comedy fans right people that work for text was a really cool bar game great burgers right and they sell a lot of number one tequila baby nice yeah that's a great little spot if you could have a that's what every city needs right they need a great little comedy community you know where you got up and comers that are really working on it people that really appreciate right yeah well there was a really good comedy scene in Atlanta and like a couple of guys that won Last Comic Standing came out of Atlanta and that's great I'm so bad with names like yeah but if you stopped and think how many real comedy communities are there in the country I don't think there's ten you think there 10 well you know st. Louis has always had one Chicago's always Denver's always had one and of course LA New York Houston Houston Kansas Nixon Greenlee and pineapple did you know works with pineapple once you know any used to do he would drive all the way across Houston to ignore me that's funny he did it he did it all the time and I had no reason to be there and I and I know that some of those guys didn't like me because I don't I don't know why I don't know why but they were really really cliquish and I went in there one night and had a horrible set and and I was following Hicks and you know and I had a really green show but in the right circumstance you know in a comedy club with nothing great happening before you it kind of worked a little bit that night didn't work at all and but and I was probably getting a little more work than those guys were some of them and they were like oh he sucks well the fact of the matter is I did suck I'm accustomed I hacked would up you know you don't want to follow me say that to make the story better I wasn't following Hicks but he was you know or Kennison but they were both there okay and I had done set but everybody was good I mean the greenly was good all these guys were seasoned pros that was a hot line up and but but I never felt what you know like they hit II of them like me except for Hicks and I came to see him you know do do shows and I asked him to do the story about just a John Davidson and the man yeah and then he goes here's what he says he goes don't stand next to the exits just a tip cuz people just walk out of the show when I watched him do that he he he did that at the Knicks comedy stop in Boston and he cleared the fucking room and it was it was crazy because at the end of the show there was me and Greg Fitzsimmons and maybe three or four other comics five or six people in the crowd there was like maybe 20 people left all told laughs and our fucking asses all right everybody else is getting up angry I saw it go both ways you know I've seen B crowds to death I saw a set one night at the last stop in Austin and nobody in the room could breathe and he was in the mood to do it and you know and you know and that and I think sometimes he was and sometimes he wasn't yeah or whatever but he was in the mood and decided to just fucking stab us all in the face and and it was just it was beautiful he was exceptional you know whether or not people think he was one of the greats like that that's entirely subjection --all right it's subjective rather it's completely up to your own interpretation but to me he changed comedy in a lot of ways because he made people talk about things that were important because everybody else was talking about nonsense you're talking about airline food and how come I can't lose I see standard normal ships and he was coming along talking about positive drug stories you know a man on acid realize it all matter is many energy condensed to a slow vibration like that whole fucking bit was here's Tom with the weather that bit was amazing yeah no no it was anyways influential I mean I don't I think I I can say this about Bill Dixon and I am an expert at stand-up comedy I would have a triple doctorate in if you gave those kinds of things for the work I've the amount of time I've put in 200 and in and you as a peer would have the exact same thing so for me to listen to someone's opinion about stand-up comedy they have to have a lot of cred to me where I really give a shit what they think okay so here's what you should think the only thing that every comic from my generation agrees on is he was better than us hmm and that's the only thing that they agree on and and they and I can't find anybody that has a big argument that he was and that was the best that ever lived no but did he influence me more than anybody else in view probably more than anybody else because you're certainly that way also right somebody built that bridge yes and you now you feel free to talk about anything you know none of yours actors ever hack you know there were a lot of hacks but I think Diggs freed people not to be a hack you know yeah he he cared people that he made it shameful you know I'm talking about hack but there was also one you cured above stealing material I guarantee you it's if there's a chain reaction to it just like Kraft getting caught getting a blowjob that shut down business all cooked until United States nobody walked into a spa without wondering whether or not it was a sting operation and your name was gonna be blown out on them isn't that crazy but here's the thing they they get this guys that there's a video this guy doing a massage so they've got video of it right and at the end the girl jerks them off what if she didn't jerk him off what if she just gave him a massage what kind of a fucked up invasion of his privacy if he just went in there to get a massage right or was everybody just getting jacked off I would imagine when you send him a plea deal to drop the charges I don't know what happened really he ratted everybody out I need to stay around kids well I gotta tell you you know I was so lonesome you know I took some comfort there you know to my lifetime as the Paul Simon once wrote and okay I'm not I'm you know what I'm not gonna say it because it's just not work yeah it's not it's not yeah but everybody seems to be perfectly aware that they could be washing your feet yeah and you know and that's fine yeah why is it that a guy like that would go to a place like that like he's so rich you know what he has a guy if you don't have a guy you get a guy like no further a cleaner look look no further than in and this is ever everybody's gonna realize how fading my memory is now but the English actor that got caught with the yes Elizabeth Hurley's husband Hugh Grant that's regret right yeah look at Hugh Grant married to the hottest woman on the planet at the time all right ruthlessly hot well yeah amazingly hot you look at me what married you either yes boyfriend/girlfriend and and even I couldn't understand that right I mean because I you know I've I've been up with a couple of hot chicks before in my life but this was he wanted it freaky yeah he and I you know I get that and it comes back to that appetite thing that guys have you know I've gotten a hand job from somebody and I admit this and it was the best sex I've ever had in my life because it was somebody that was number one it was a great massage and then this tantric thing going on and and and you know and and it but it was fantastic hmm and and pricey and and and it's free most anywhere and that's in Vegas as legal as it can be right you know they have milking tables that have a hole you're digging through and they do table look it up they got it for the guy he lies in a stomach well you don't know crack with that hard-on fella gets laid on your back no but it makes more sense identically to have like a hole in the bottom of the table it'll be on the screen I'm sure soon and I'm not all I'm saying is that in Lincoln Canada they you know or the most of the rest of the world right it's getting a tug is really not considered a crime of any kind whatsoever and is harmless and who gives a shit well why is it okay to massage your feet but it's not okay to massage I would rather massage my dick than my own feet I would and I proved it on a regular basis yeah regular basis I think the problem really is sex trafficking that's the problem here you know that's the worst thing exactly that I can imagine but it but it but again I'm not gonna no no because it's the most horrific thing you can have that's the most horrific thing you can imagine is taking some image launched in that series about taking Madeleine and I'm and so I'm like I just can't even that that I would you know I would support any anything any way shape or form yeah to have it stomped out spend billions of dollars put boots on the ground you know you know thought if you can in any way you can women who are trying to be legitimate sex workers whether or not you think that's the thing they you know doesn't matter what I think it you know go damn stirrer damn before I took my mother to Barcelona yes I wanted a little three-day stopover before I spent eight days with mom and Barcelona and and their signs don't take pictures of our sex works that and our sex workers not sex with our sex works right and I mean they they totally own it and go hey this is not a bad deal you know that you know you you're you know what you're qualified to do make french fries or it turns out you're super hot and and you in our country you can have this job or in LA or in this country you can have that job just not everywhere but yeah there's only a couple spots in this country right click carded Nevada yeah Nevada for I think that you know I don't even know yeah I think just about I think that's it but it's to me here's what I realized is important okay I play Vegas a lot right I'm 10 weekends a year at the Mirage and marijuana is is legal recreationally now and they have the biggest dispensary in the world like a like it's like Universal made it or something you know it's God well went in there it was fantastic and prostitution is legal you can get a little drink of liquor 24 hours a day seven days a week and I realized that I'm a law-abiding citizen here when I'm standing on this part of the United States ground I don't break any laws at all I can be free that's why I feel so good when I go to the Vegas that's why people go do you like Vegas do you get tired of it I'm no no you don't worry cuz I can breathe deep motherfucker that's why I could be Who I am yeah I can do it openly yeah I can you know and and and so can everybody else and you get a that and that's why oh yeah I've sold out a hundred fifty shows and they're gonna sell you the the you know the you realize it's the law that causes the paranoia you know and because when you're in Amsterdam in one of those coffee shops smoking a joint drinking a badass cup of coffee yeah it's fun and free you know it freeing and and it's the way it should be you know the the fact of the matter is the same thing happens to me in Florida with just a little bit I'm handcuffed taken to jail and and move from City Jail to County Jail and processed and fingerprinted and photographed they printed my address on the internet so people anybody in the world could just walk straight over to the house I don't think anybody did because nobody gives a shit they except for a people a few people did right Ron White has a jet that's the part I don't believe but anyway yeah man it's the law is the real problem when you make alcohol illegal you you made organized crime big that's what happened that's what they did learn that from prohibition they should be learning that from all all the drug problems we have a guarantee of marijuana we'll be selling for the price of corn in 20 years because it takes the same no matter ever to grow it right no it's easier it's really easier you probably need less pesticides right you know there's there's a gigantic problem south of our border folks with drugs and it's because of us it's 100% because of us we mean not us like you and me I don't do any drugs they sell the pot that I get I get from people that grow it in California but there's a lot of people that buy coke and if you buy coke or meth you're probably buying it from someone down there and you know there's a goddamn thriving industry that would go away if we made things legal if we gave people like you Ron Dwight yeah you're telling me you shouldn't be able to go buy coke who the fuck are they to tell you you can't buy coke first of all you sell tequila right kill yourself you can way more fucked up on my tequila yeah or no quit as fucked up as fucked up as heroin and fucked up is anything else I know I self you know I'm my own amazingly great tequila I have found myself puking because I'm an idiot and got just too carried away and you know it's probably easy to kill yourself with to kill than it is with coke you probably do a lot of coke to die right it's probably hard to do that coke at the end when your fucking nose is bleeding your heart's pounding on your chest you go take another bump to push yourself over the edge it's probably hard in this car face oh yeah oh yeah right okay they shot about 55 times yeah no Joey Diaz alive and well you tried Joey Diaz is alive and well right you guys do a lot of coke to kill you especially well Joey Diaz that motherfucker can never play dead he can eat rat poison and go do a show right he'd be maakad death fuck you cocksucker I witness ago I went to see him in Austin he was playing in Austin yeah yeah watched him just blister a crowd I mean you know Lister him he's my co it was it was so much fun to watch as a guy see him do short sets all time but I got to watch him do you know is 50 I think he did probably about 50 minutes or so that it was great we had a blast try replicating that and this fuckin sanitized world right well there's Purell everywhere you turn the thing is you know you if you're true something I believe that it is a comic or whatever if you're true to your nature then enough people will be attracted to that that you don't that the only mistake you can make is to not be true to your nature Yeah right if you look at all the great a really successful comics in in the history of comedy they they were true to who they were I mean Cosby but but you know yeah he he tricked everybody unconscious so I never really did that bit on stage yeah I never really did that bit on stage very much can I do it on your show dude oh fuck yeah yeah let me think about Cosby in Bill Kyle is Bill's defense explained to us years ago how much he hates cursing and no one curses more than a wide-awake woman who's being raped so it's just joke I know but it made me cry laughing because it's so fucked up I mean you look it's both true and fucked up right it is true yeah it is yeah it's not endorsing rape that's why I've never really found a spot the opening lineup that's an hour and 20 minutes long so open with that motherfucker sir you know what it was always just a mixed review it made people think it may be yes you know it was like baby duck pussy lip tacos you know you either like it or you didn't like it but you listen to the next bit wow you made sense though it does make sense yeah I mean it really doesn't joke it's just a funny thing to say well I think we should all should have known like but with his trying to control other people he was always trying to control young black comics and stop them swearing right thing that Lee said the prior prior did you get paid yeah yeah tell bill to have a Coke and a smile and shut the fuck up right yeah good that was it there's a guy that I'd like to get back in the comedy Eddie Murphy all right Eddie if you're out there can't packing the college so hard at raw you know Rob oh good delirious delirious was best comedy specials of all time I think so of all time and he did his thing so himself yes Bill Cosby hotels very good you know a lot of comics learned a lot about stand-up comedy watching Bill Cosby himself oh yeah he knew how to hold a moment oh yeah oh it was a beautiful oh he works well you know that thing was framed like this yeah the whole show was just his face and no cutaway to fuckin want people laughing in the audience or cheesy shots from up here where you can't see who it is it was just framed in right just on his face and yeah and and it was it was gorgeous work just gorgeous work I've thought about this many times do you think that those people from back in that era from back in like the 60s and the 50s that they used to drug each other and they didn't think it was as big a deal like that men would do that which what we would consider today to be horrific you know the idea that you would take someone's daughter and drugged her and fuck it's horrific oh we have wits we want violent repercussions fair that's how violent I wanna smash but do you think that maybe back then they were ignorant but they didn't know any better like you always hear about people slipping people a Mickey did they think it was cute where they actually do like how many men were doing that back then do you know I find myself to be so conservatively that I really can't think outside in that box you know I didn't watch that documentary about him taking that girl they don't know what happened to her too much just three years old but they were but it talks a lot about recovery you know and I just sick of fucking world is out there and I can't even think about it I mean I don't know this one detective had to look through these dark websites and I'm like and look at these images you can tun look at those images you know it's just a sickening thing at no run they're having a hard time with that with people that work for social media sites when they have to take down videos like on Facebook and things like that like a lot of them like they're taking down these horrific videos like horrible all all day long these people were just finding the things that are like horrible accident it's horrible assassinations Isis videos and they just taking him down right you know I was on Jim Norton show one time he showed me a video of a gaff fuckin a snake and I'm like dude I don't want to see any of this shit yeah Jim no one Jim Jim and that and he's very very funny and I love to whatever I do with Jim's fun but he looks at anything on the channel people loving the heads off and all that stuff and everybody just said well yeah look at this and I'm like the guy's a snake pussy you found a snake pussy and stuck is will you ever see a snake egg you know regular size cock so you know it's a fucking hole yeah let's find a hole that dudes have him fucked I'll find you a hole it can't be fucked fired I love Jim Norton for the same reason why I love you he's just himself like he's not pretending to be anybody he they won't watch a man fuck a snake he's he watched men fuck men he loves everything he likes he likes transgender women he gets off on it gets he gets cane he's open about it talks about all the time to the point where when he was on Opie and Anthony and the one they were in their prime it was like one of their major themes was that Norton is into transgender women what's that called I don't know it's called being Jim Norton right he's happy I mean there's got to be a name right for yeah just probably some name some this is probably like a slang term for it or in this probably some sort of you know now I would think if anybody knew what that was it would be you yeah I've never heard Jamie you think there's a word for dudes her only into transgender women I bet there is if there isn't we could probably make that you're talking about or sure there's got to be like oh man there's now a woman right right right not a woman that's now a man well this should be too right there's beggars which is a man who's now a woman but still has a deck and she could peg you yeah right she's your your girlfriend and she can fuck your ass I had I had I had sex with a woman there was a she played for the WNBA whoa she said six three but I know she was a full head taller than me and she was so tall she could stick a finger in my ass well she our arms were so long that she could reach around while I was whoa and stick a finger in my ass and I'm like let's just go to the church you know and get this over with yeah make some gladiator children that's right big funny dude come on in my search here I haven't found that term but I've never heard lesbian a lesbian man a lesbian man what does that mean I think you stab at it it's a it's it's a it's a it's a man who turns himself into a woman but he still likes women yeah but he can keep his penis I think I think that's what's gonna keep his penis yeah he just likes to be pegged by women oh not and he's not in the guys I've never heard that a lesbian man right so he only likes you you know what I want to be bisexual that just opens the field up all the ways I shut it down that you're right and who's gonna that's like a IQs that pond to fish from question not very big not very big a lesbian man imagine if like that's all you'll put this bat-signal out I'm a lesbian man I'm just looking for gals to peg me I bet there's a lot of them that would want to fuck you just for revenge how much of that is women that why is it that that pretty women don't seem to have any problem with men like a lot of them are like pretty easygoing about men but if you have bad genetics like if you got dealt a wrong in the stick that's that is if there's like people talk about income inequality in this country and that's definitely a real thing but if there's a real thing it's like who do people want to fuck inequality in this country that's off the goddamn charts right I mean it's just as men and as women we just have to we have to understand some people they have a unearned tyranny on sexual affection it's unearned they didn't have to do anything like these Russian woman's the people are lying to you about right yeah you meet them and go Jesus it's just Russian gladiator genetics and perfect like model form and you're like holy shit let me get the fuck out of this room quick I was on a cruise one time I was married and and I had rented the like the back quarter the I've ever ended the same spot Oprah stays in and it cost a fortune and I'm mad we're out on the deck and and there's two big suites in the middle and another one just like mine at the end but the one that was in this one which was also a real expensive room was this Russian dude and he was short kind of chunky and bald but the girl that was with him it was just a 12 and I knew his second I saw her I was fucked because there's no way my wife was not gonna catch me just at least taking one little glimpse at explore and then she's going out if that's what you want you'd rather fuck her and me like no absolutely not absolutely not why would I why would I that's outrageous what an outrageous assertion what an accusation yeah if they only knew how vulnerable we are to a woman like that it's like that woman can there's a lot of people that that woman can like run their life and they'll meet a guy who's an accountant who's never fucked to 12 and they'll start talking to him and basically and they're doing anything they want to do as long as they're willing to actually touch him as long as they're willing to stick their fucking beautiful times mouth he's helpless suck on his lips with Ryan that pussy against us he's got his ass he'll put your finger on the base of his taint rub it while you stick your tongue down strode his dick as hard as a rock things have never happened to this man there goes the neighborhood just back the car to the house throw the keys in the fucking yard tell the kids yeah that's that iced tea so I really hoped it would turn out this way iced tea in body count fuck yeah there's certain women that you could just run you oh yeah I get it I married one of them it's gonna be careful just get you that if you were if you're not if you're not here's the thing yeah how much of that like for dudes who you there's certain cases where you know it's not gonna work like god damn it this dude he's like a small sheep and he married a wolf just a matter of time before she fleeces him and gets the fuck out of Dodge and hopefully he'll still be alive but this is not gonna work out we've all seen that before oh I wish I could tell you this story I wish you could too I shut this fucking podcast off and resume in ten minutes okay all right let me tell you this story because I just don't want to say it's intertwined with something right but it's very very pertinent to the dedications can anybody go to jail no can anybody get sued no no I don't think so and it's the truth okay so I'll just create a fictional scenario let's call the gentleman what do you want to call them let's let's call him Todd Blaker Todd Bleeker okay now I can't even do it this way I think people would find out slow down okay also I'm drunk and I know you gonna rock on you know and it's my fault fucking people on reddit they had their fingers above the keys they were hovering ready to start searching right no there is no such thing is a guy named night and I will not tell you the story on this the same but anyway what was amazing was I saw it happening in front of me yeah you you know is his wife was they've been married for a long time and he didn't look like much and and and at all and and and there was a kind of an assistant and that was ridiculously gorgeous and and so I just looked at that and I was like you know what this is don't exactly yeah I've seen where I thought it was going and and and there was nothing he can do I mean there was absolutely he was completely powerless over this person you know oh yeah like Gary Oldman in Dracula remember that like what no no Ryan there was just hypnotized by oh ha ha yes I finished shirt in the middle night and Gary old would be slithering into the fucking windows as mist right her body heat with it's like oh yeah with Kathleen Turner it was the fucking chair through the window right in the fucking bat yeah he didn't even want to use the door to fuck it was Kathleen Turner back in the desert I mean she developed some health problems as she got older but when she was young holy moly yeah it was amazing yeah it was long he ever feel like rubbin went off thinking about me out if you said go ahead and do it nice nice reciprocation yeah it's hard when you watchin the guy get preyed upon when you're watching like a man struggle with the fucking spider's web and you're like well hey man you know it'll be fun when she does fuck you right yeah all right so as long as you can stay active right get close to her don't let her get too much money yeah careful yeah it I know because you know the wife had been around for a long time and it was a contract yes oh there goes that part of it but I think the paperwork was fairly solid and towards the end of like a limit or whatever okay now everybody I knew a guy was about to marry gone shouldn't and he was trying to do no prenuptial and my friends were screaming at him like what the fuck are you talking about he's like look man I don't if it if it doesn't work out I'd like her to have half and they went what the fuck it's almost like you know like you wish you had garlic to put around you right now you're telling Noah about the flood so really you're ugly she's not okay understand this world is not fair the reality of not fair is you made enough money to attract her but she's got a got a web you might get hooked you might get injected or you might be able to figure out a way to keep her nervous right how you do had job you can act mysterious bro I'm serious and I've like a book is that how you did a special book you read you gotta be Moody got to go on early morning runs well they're still sleep show powers do any of these things show powers that I haven't done what are these things you have to be different you have to be able to quote Shakespeare yeah you got to be you know you got to be willing to give up a lot of money if you're an ugly dude you got a hot wife you got a certain amount of time before she gets bored with you good lord fucker trainer right her trainer here right what I think is gonna happen is within the net say that exact same thing I've seen that happen yeah I've been friends with a lot of people where that's happened what I think is gonna happen within the next 50 years is they're going to be able to eliminate the idea of unattractive people legitimately through through DNA right I think they're gonna be able to do that where they're not gonna know the world that we knew when we were kids no internet no fake tits sometimes people were just unattractive no one knew anything about diet and nobody worked out nobody worked out yeah when I was in high school it'll be fucking work dudes would like bench press and shit you know how many women lifted weights we were in high school the cheerleaders were in good shape yeah for a little while yeah for a little while and they got nobody no nobody kept going did rocky really start like the big movement started - I've read about it but I don't know how true it is - way too young dude when rocky came out I think I was seven and I drank raw eggs and ran around the block I told services to loan that I doubt that that was a bit i 100% did I was like holy shit I want to be a fighter I started drinking eggs and running I ran oh seven years old fuck am i doing running maybe I was eight had no such a fake phone knock times at the doctor the doctor did ah I think we're running was amazing he goes eight I don't know how all there was but I remember it when it came out I've never been more inspired for something in my life I movie changed the world people and even understand how good it was he lives on my street Haley hey does he driving his Range Rover with a with a big cockatiel on his shoulder that's kind of cool there is running around fucking weights at his hand and shit running with converse all-stars one of the reasons why I wear them for this day they might not be all-stars it might be kids it might be like some cheap Walmart version who knows but this is a fucking epic shit in the 1970s what year was this movie what let's say guess what year do you think it was I want to say like 79 yeah 76 76 the spirit of 76 was the rematch no that was 76 because that was when Apollo Creed I was at only six I had a middle ass exactly when one matters across I believe was Alabama we and he drove 1970 he drove two Bicentennial Vega right so it was a Vega the 76 Vega had said 76 you know some things that would you know celebrate the sesquicentennial or whatever was the noticing probably 200 years yes mm-hmm a long time that was nine years over this movie came out and so that's exactly how old I was I gotta tell you technique something good needs to tighten up on a swing let the way he's thrown punch coach you need a coach well he got one in Carl Weathers this was a in Rocky - right Rocky - Carl Weathers became his put it was it rocky three three right because that was when he fought mr. t yeah that's right right yeah hey woman he woman since a man ain't got no heart I bet you stay up every night wish he had a real man bring your pretty little self hold my apartment tonight and I'll show you real man she probably worth oh I couldn't believe he was saying that to Rocky right right it was like if he was saying it to Waterloo Daniels you know yeah man oh I didn't even finish a story oh yeah what else so here's what happened my first encounter with Alisa I found out that the bad guy were coming out on one side one dressing room and the good guys were coming out of the other side so I went up to the stands and waited for the super inferno to come out and when he came out I spit on him I just spit on it was a big oh I hate oh I really I did I've never hated anybody hold important I'm eight just spit on him and then the cop saw me do it and they can't got me and they took me to my cousin and they're like he spit on a super inferno like you know he was like oh that horrible and if he doesn't anything you just keep you and so but afterwards my cousin thought it was hilarious of course he did that's a story I was trying to put him out yeah the super inferno you think you get it yeah it's funny yeah I don't think I've ever been to see a live professional wrestling match other than Eleanor Kerrigan from The Comedy Store well you know Tony and yes guys they they go do these and oh yeah you got to go with his I'm like nah you know alright Tony was responsible for ten minutes of my last special me shitting on him for load right right right it was that River I remember he loves it yeah he does that show the the for what does it call for storm and I before Stormin it's a they do a wrestling podcast from The Comedy Store with a bunch other comics who the other guys find out their names you'll find it out in wine but uh yeah he loves that shit loves it he's always like dude you can watch with me you'll love it it's the store horsemen all right store horse perfect with the gentlemen that are involved in this venture with him fun show I did it once Tony Hinchcliffe Johnny's cordis Matt Edgar and Josh Martin there you go yeah Chris Burns there you go there you go yeah they do it from the basement you've been that studio downstairs in the basement I did a podcast out of there fucking great down there man I love the fact that the Comedy Store has embraced podcast you know the Comedy Store embraces what's important always yeah over any other place so you know what they embrace comedians and they you know customers really come second to the comics they're so because there's one parking lot people probably not know this but there's one parking lot holds about 30 cars or something like that or 20 cars or whatever and guess who gets to park there the comedians that are playing that night they get to pull right up and park by the door and that is so cool to me and not only that there's a bar that if your name is not written on that building you can't go in it without somebody whose name is written on that building yeah and those are the and it's so cool to have your name written on that building and go to that bar that's just for you and and I you know they they have the my number one tequila and and I can smoke cigars and not everybody can smoke in there but I get that one little extra deal they don't give a fuck don't let you do it every one there so yeah yeah in there you know there's a place to smoke pot they built that they built a glass piano for prior to snort cocaine of us because they understood here's what they understood Joe here's what they understood the others are the comics are insane yeah so come be insane here yeah you know if if you're crazy we get it we don't care yeah come be crazy here you know and then at the improv yet but Freeman goes going language language watch your language he fucking say that I heard him say it and the first time I ever came to the comedy store which was probably in 90 or 89 I made a sojourn out here you know to see what happened so I don't know anything I don't know anything I don't have any friends I don't know I don't know anybody my god I've stayed in the cheapest hotel room on Sunset Boulevard which was $50 which was outrageous back then and and in the first day I got into a hotel into an elevator with this huge black transvestite that was all dressed up going to a show going to a to a you know at one of those big drag queen shows and I was like okay alright and but I went to the to the Comedy Store first and they say it was a Monday night and they fucking put me on I told him I I've been doing you know stand-up in Texas for you know a couple of years and they fucking put me on they didn't do very well and not necessarily you know in the set same piano player you know this nothing changes and but I would go to the through the improv and buddy come over to me go and he knew me because he'd seen me do open mic at the improv and be the opening act and the improv and in the house and he's come up doing rock could you do me a favor and like yeah but what could you stand over there because you're blocking away through here for the like okay okay so they just wouldn't date the you know they I was a new guy you know and I all I needed was you know a a break whether I deserved it or not they gave it to me it's a store the store has a heart that way you know they you know the store is the art form is primary that's everything it's everyday you know built around that art form d-didn't used to let the agents and the managers in though he could get a pot you had a buy a ticket if you like we're a CIA agent you come see this guy or that guy Ron white get a buy a ticket there's the only place in town because so the agents couldn't just come in and and run the place like they did in a lot of places they were commonly would be in the back of the room talking I remember I went to a showcase once it was a backward William Morris put on this showcase of the comedian's they represented and they did a club like a night club on Sunset and Nick DiPaolo was on stage yeah and they asked me to perform like you're out of your fucking mind I'm like there's no way I'm gonna perform at this I know what this is I'm like I'm not looking to get hired for anybody I'm already represented I go I'm gonna watch okay this is gonna be a disaster so I go with my manager and I'm in the top level and everyone's talking all these fucking agents and agents assistants crowd they're not even watching no reason not even watching run and so I'm watching these guys struggle on stage where no one John Henson goes up and then Nick DiPaolo goes up but Nick was the only one who said anything about it and run everybody fucking talking at the top like these are my fucking agents this is unbelievable he was he was making fun of it but it was the Comedy Store would never allowed that they would kick everybody out of that room get the fuck out of here right I get out of here and they'd they still to this day don't holler 8:00 that kind of shit at a they don't breed that kind of thing and also let me go on record of saying this Joe I'm not saying I don't like the other rooms and I'm not saying I'm not glad they're there and I'm not saying I don't need them as bad as I need the store they're they're good solid comedy rooms and I think they're trying to make the adjustments and they're starting because somebody asked me the other day and one of the other clubs one of the comics hanging out at the Comedy Store I'm like oh yeah let me tell you number one you don't sell my tequila and they do and and but also they when I come to your place I got either I got a I got a valet park and pay for it you pay me $25 to do a set they pay me thirty-five dollars now both of these numbers are low but just some comics they'd rather have that other chair they notice the ten bucks get out you need the money for zone and in a lot of cases now you have to choose between those two clubs you know is it still that way oh I know it was no the store in the improv in particular get along really well we get along really well now and Paige who does all the booking for the improv is always at the store and she's good friends with Adam okay we're all together that's good yeah I offered you a spot on the show that I'm doing tonight at the improv if you wanted to do it because I'm I'm there at nighttime yeah you're doing a show tonight yeah I'm doing a show at 8:00 o'clock tonight The Improv you got another one Thursday night at The Improv okay other tonight for Vogue yeah Ron White yeah beautiful now drunk at my nail it what happen is the perfect time it's five o'clock all right bye time eight o'clock rolls around you'll be simmering you'll be like braised beef and we're not gonna need adderall you'll be falling off the bone that's what are you putting it into your schedule it's three hours now Oh J McGraw your your my whether it is I love him I had his daddy on the show no he's calling me now his daddy was dropping science his daddy his dad's a fucking genius dr. Phil yep he's a great guy like people who don't know dr. Phil he's a fucking great guy you know it it's a he sent me a text the other day and he goes I've got this idea you're gonna think is crazy and so we meet at the Beverly Hills Hotel and and I play a lot of golf with doc and I know him well and have for 10 years and or whatever who's died dr. Phil oh yeah who you remember who were talking about yeah but he said doc I never called the doc home Phil oh I thought I call him doc he's dad yeah Jay's daddy can take him out and plate that's what I said so he goes all right here's what we should do we should do a two-man show and and and I know he's out of production Anna no he's bored and he's also hurt so he's had that motorcycle wreck and you know getting new shoulder surgery right Brenda so he's like he really can't play golf and I was just bored and so it so he really and and and I would do anything dr. Phil wanted to do you know cuz I love spending time with him and in the end all anything you think he does is a big success anyway so I would do it but he really here was his idea okay it's a it's a it's a two-man show on Broadway right anything goes and then you know I'm not sure how it starts and I'm like okay it would probably start where the curtain opens and you and I are standing there because it's a two-man show on Broadway that's probably how it starts and he goes in there we can do a Q&A and I'm like now we'd have to do something before the QA doc right because we've done that before and it's hilarious right I just as close as we are I mean that where were born and our circumstances in life and and and he's completely under mention Oliva and fucking beyond me as far as any kind of success that anybody's ever had but and what we both came from nothing in the same part of the world and so we have this connection that people have a hard time understanding you know they believe you and dr. Phil or literally we tell people we love each other and that's I mean and and and and to give you a good example that he took me diving we flew in his Gulfstream to the Cayman Islands and I didn't have a certificate or anything but I'd had one it was just expired and and and so we went on this dive and he watched me like I was four years old the whole time we were underwater and if I got close to something I shouldn't you know so so I know he loves me right I know he loves me and and and so but there way really didn't have an idea but I just knew that I knew that he was that he was bored and any what to have lunch and and and talk about something I like let's talk about it because I would do anything I would love to figure out something to do with him that makes sense because we would because we come off really fun together and in in in a in in a juxtaposition situation right and our views even though we come from a similar background how different the views are in some ways and out several they are in some way so it's fun stuff no we should through your podcast together we love it yeah yeah I just did it he just did it like tonight oh yeah I knew that hmm now he's exceptional I love that guy he's fucking easygoing guy to really need to be around right you know like comfortable his own skin see you know as a reason why it's so successful right it's not like anybody could do that like look at that dr. Oz guy dr. oz guy I just watched him when I was like I don't know what you know he he does three unscripted hours a day all day and he doesn't podcast now and dad did his podcast cuz I also heard during that ledge he said also I have a podcast and number one started up and you know I'm gonna do a few people before I do you just get used to it and then I have you come on like well for sure I'll do that how funny is that he thinks he's needs to get used to it all right yeah he does unscripted television along with a camera in his face all day long well it turns out he didn't need to get used to it he was great at it from the very course he was yeah yeah that's the same exact skill he talks to people he knows how to talk to people he knows how to listen that's the does yeah that's like what is missing yeah and a lot of people when it comes to say yeah whereas playing golf wonder one time when I was going through a divorce and people ask me that does he give unsolicited advice and I'm like he doesn't give solicited advice even if you ask so I'm playing golf with him and I'm like doc this this divorce has killed me it's just killing me and he goes keep your head still when you putt that's what he said I like what you guys keep your head still when you putt you you're in a better mood when you putt well but you're moving your head all over the place so why don't we start we'll keep your head still when you putt which now is a metaphor for a lot of things to me just keep your head still when you putt you know do what you do well you know it's what makes you feel better or whatever you know but in that particular case that those were really simple words and I know they were right off the cuff and I've thought about them all the time since you keep your head still when you putt that's solid advice yeah all right so it's so it's it's a little to be more centered B and you know it in the zone I'm not if you're playing pool to keep your head down when you shoot right keep your head down don't don't jump up on the shot and that was a follow-through but but you wouldn't exactly call it advice but it but it was it was something Ellison to and continue to think about to this fucking day it is advice because if you're really good at golf in that respect if you know how to not move your head like that's a discipline where you can you can apply that to the rest of your life right yeah you know you're if you're loose and you're not drinking and you're fucked up and you're not using good technique your heads gonna be all over the place right same thing a pool stay down on your show right now archery yeah oh yeah still yeah yeah follow through correct follow through it's very important some more do you try to control it be all herky-jerky and shit archery is all archery is in quantum most zen things I've ever done in my life surprisingly surprisingly then you know Foxworthy when he built his big house in Georgia he had deer set up deer target set up that he could walk out in the balcony of his office I have them in my yard we had deer problem in our neighborhood and I said you know what you got to do just shut the gate and turn Foxworthy loose in here with a pillow and he would kill everything in here he's a natural-born killer you gotta be real careful people shooting arrows and neighborhoods they do that in certain places they have these residential deer hunting permits where they allow bow hunters to come in and shoot deer in you know suburban communities because they just have such an overpopulation that too many people are hitting with their cars right yeah yeah so like this place is like I think there was one place it taxes you feed them Doritos out of your hand yeah they'll just spread it around your ears a bag of Doritos especially those high fence places right where they have feeders set right there's there's a place in tech in Pennsylvania look up this is true there's a neighborhood where you can hunt out here there 365 pigs you're a pig story tell me no no no no go ahead no I'm done all right Jamiel Google the Pennsylvania place where you can hunt deer 365 days a year all right beside let me figure out a way to tell the story okay you know Jay our buddy Jay McGraw is a TV producer right so they produce the doctors and the dr. Phil show and the bull on CBS but they also have another 10 or 12 shows on any level of cable and if they can sell it they'll make it as a TV production company so the guy that made the movie and I always screw up his name so I'm gonna have you look it up that did the movie the about the kid and which took 16 years to make the link lighter as the way my saying right from Texas was a movie they followed him from the time he was a kid a dad but the movie took 16 years to make oh yeah it was called about a boyhood boy a boy yeah so in the director was James got a lot of tabs opens I think Linklater yeah I don't know so he he bought two I just want to get the story right John he bought two miniature pot-bellied pigs that turned out to be not miniature pot-bellied pig Whitney Cummings says that's not real at all those miniature pigs that just starved little pigs let me okay let me finish let me finish all right so he needs to find something to do with these pigs and it turns out in Bastrop Texas where he lives now this is a very famous artistic probably one of the best directors alive and he's from Texas he did that he did the first movie with Matthew McConaughey about living in Austin and I and I you know you just give me so wasted on this show I can't ever remember anything but anyway Matthew McConaughey with AIDS right no no no no no somebody so this is the first thing Matthew McConaughey really discovered McConaughey in when he was going to University of Texas and did movie what I got to start bringing a friend I mean what huh Oh No when you just talked about yeah boy huh no no no Matthew McConaughey only does silver spare me the Matthew McConaughey in that director first movie Matthew what kind of ever did I think was a stinking few days of confused old school all right all right all right all right yeah right here so okay was it dear thing true yes I found a neighborhood where it's true but oh wait okay so you're it and I'm gonna insert a story all right so this is my Matthew McConaughey story when I was moving to Austin I have friends there that are you know I like Austin and I got friends but I always thought you know I'll end up being friends with Matthew McConaughey and because we know a lot of the same people you know and and we both smoked I were both in Texas were both you know and this will happen and and I love him and I really like work it was worried and I was like that's what we friends it'll be great I'll be great part of my thing Austin so I meet Matthew McConaughey had a chariot event but in in this scenario I have imagined him saying you're Ron White you're my favorite comedian ever I got a hot tub going off in my backyard with a couple of girls and I got these great fucking joints and we'll go over there and smoke pot drink tequila and but what happened was he went oh nice to me in any way under me next person and it was a long pause there where I should have said I love your work but I didn't because I already had it planned out that he was supposed to say that much he loved me and so I just left a long pause there and then when it was all over with us should I didn't tell him I love you I gotta tell them I thought I loved it but I didn't isn't a sound with planning so anyway back to the big story so this cab finds the pig rescue and decides he wants to do a documentary about it well he calls Jaime McGraw's right-hand girl right-hand girl right woman brilliant girl that runs things for Jay and I remember her name because I'm an idiot not met her two times but and and says I'd like to do a documentary on this this thing so she tells Jay and he goes we clatter all right yeah so he calls CBS and I don't even though I should be telling the story and they say fuck yeah we'll do anything he wants to do it's got his name on it right he's like he's got a movie coming out with Cate Blanchett they're supposed to win everything there is and he's an amazing guy just an artist doesn't care a thing about anything but art doesn't matter if it takes 16 years to make this guy's amazing ID so Jay has this idea of us doing judge Roy Bean with me as judge Roy Bean with doing a comedy and or we're not even zeroed in on what but we like me doing that character of preacher hangman bartender right so and I would like to play the role and I wouldn't mind finding a TV show to settle into at my age you know for a while you know if I could do it but it's got to be the right thing with the right people right or I won't do it and so CBS says yeah we'll do it you know fuck yeah we'll do it and so they're they're gonna make they're gonna have a meeting and so Jay calls me goes well why don't we talk to about this George judge Roy Bean thing so I live in Austin right so I'm right 27 miles from Bastrop and and so I go out there for the meeting and it's in this little restaurant on a river and and and they talk about that for a little while and then we talked a little bit about judge Roy Bean and then it's time to go to the pig rescue well I don't have to go to the pig rescue but now I'm big you know I really want him to track this film because I know if he does it'll be made of film you know it'll be it'll be a big thing if he does it so I go 250 pigs well kept and well fed fenced in and pins they actually there's a feral pig problem in that part of Texas and they have these cameras that are predator cameras and they they have footage of these huge feral pigs walking up to this fence looking at these pigs going how'd y'all get in here really whether you lay in the mud and they bring you food what the how do you we don't even know we don't know how we got in here we're just in there and and they're there any where from they had some rescues that were little bitty to 750 pound pigs all of them sold into the same premise that these are miniature pigs and 150 pounds 750 these people are so anxious pigs Alex removed to about 3 up you think I'm kiddin he bought three up and turned them loose in the wild and they turn into pigs what he gonna do well he lived up in up in the whatever the high mountains he's part of the problem right part of the problem ok here you go so we go I'm walking around it's all it's all it's it's well done and this guy seems really reasonable right and and he's also an executive for a construction company a big construction company and this is his passion and there's alright this is the part I can't tell ya I understand pigs so and I end up liking the pigs you know they're their knives if you scratch them they they have arthritis - the big ones they can hardly get around and but it's basically it's a who's gonna save these pigs kind of an operation and I'm like though well do you know the carnita got wood you know probably pitch in you know if you wanted to retire you know because I asked the guy I said what's the where do they go from here and he goes that's it so he did someone adopt someone they get turned to bacon they know they that's it they lived there until they die Wow is the way I think so weird because there almost dots here I left this part out oh so we're in the house talking about ship and and I've had enough of it and I've got to join my pocket and I really want to smoke some pot and hang with the pigs because it seems like that would be really fucking fun you know just to scratch on the pigs I'll stone and shit and that's how mature I am and and so that this pig comes out of the back squealing and they go that's Whitney Cummings pig so she rescued a pig during the Malibu fires she documented it very heavily on her Instagram yes Jo - I've seen her pig I saw it in person that's Whitney Cummings pigs so they're like a couple nights later I'm up at the store and Whitney Cummings sits there and I go oh where do you see this she drove that fucking pig all the way across I feel like two days of driving she's insane drove a pig in a car for two days - a pig sanctuary that's ridiculous it's hilarious dude that's Whitney Cummings pig that's hilarious that's crazy I want to hear more of the story but I gotta piss so bad I'm gonna pee my pants two podcasts in a row talk to this guy we can't just cut the thing off for a while we could just cut it off totally yeah is it because it's 5:30 yeah yeah I got nothing to do I got nowhere to be I saw how was that you ride until Tony last night you had a good time there yeah yeah yeah it was it was just a gasps I had a friend I'd dinner with friends that night and in Malibu and then came out did that set and and it was it's just a great idea for a show the kill Tony show if you have a chance to download that podcast is a it's a hoot it's it it's so much fun to do it so they're a live audio sound economy store and it's a great premise and I won't bore you with all the details but you can just tune in if you check the video it probably is up on YouTube oh yeah it's a big it's not it's not Joe show but it's a big the band just up a little Clark how many guys oh they were so funny Jeremiah doing Foxworthy was was it really what Jeremiah just makes me laugh it's so hard everything he does just kills me and he'll be you know hopefully in my old age you'll be giving me mercy work because I tell him how good he is he has his own podcast - i jeremiah wonders where he does he does some voices and whatnot she doesn't have guests you should probably just talking about it I don't know that I didn't know that you weren't on and I don't want to say it that way but you know I haven't been on it the I was wondering why Bill Byrd didn't have me on his show and the friends that he didn't have anybody shows him all by himself some people a lot of comedian Chris D'Elia does it all by himself - oh really he's had like one guest on I think was just his brother for a special but he's done 130 or so all by himself it's a lot you could do one pie all by yourself - you know what I couldn't because her not you I've got a I've got to save up thoughts for eight months to do the Rogen show and so I saw him loyal to the I'm loyal to this show my buddies huh do you know what that is no Mitzi shore oh wow yeah our friend Taylor Taylor boss he painted that for me well how badass is that that's an old picture of Mitsubishi 30 seconds cute oh yeah she was very hot she was one of the most important figures in the history of comedy one of the most important figures of my life for sure that lady mentored me all of us I mean all of us because yeah that's that's the only reason the store exist but the inmates run the sign right she's the only person that let the in understood it right a mental hospital there's that's the actual original picture of her how great is that ah it's fucking amazing she's like Betty White you ever see those titty pictures of Betty I was like 21 years old yeah let's monkey was so crazy and wild it's alright that she's got her nipples in that picture all right she's our friend rose who's Taylor his girlfriend put a post on her when she died I couldn't repost it like for any other woman I'm at might be able to repost it but she said like I forget what she called or something about there's something she called her like the greatest boss bitch in history like I can't I can't say that I like it but I can't repost that right you know just didn't you just say it yeah but I mean I can't say I can't put it on my Instagram you know I'm just repeating what she said okay but it was just to me it was a hilarious and accurate a woman can say shit like that but a lady like current doesn't look bad a man calls her a boss bitch okay have some respect all right it's fucking Mitzi shore but yeah so Taylor painted for me and hangs over the studio watches over us you know I genuinely don't think I ever met her no no yeah I had those great conversations with her like man when I came in that first time you know I was just in and out and I had no idea what was going on and and then I really didn't come back to because like I did a show in Newport Beach it's a laugh stop out there and just got this horrific horrible review did I tell the story last night I was it was so bad how bad oh there was a picture of me I don't even stand to a stand up for my three and a half years and so then the guy that booked that room watch me do it like an eight-minute set in Austin and I had a killer eight minutes but he hires me to do 45 minutes and and so I go out there and I'm nervous anyway right because it's and that that's a big club and and the two guys before B were Seinfeld and Slayton so right so they've been Ron why it's three and a half year old booger eating moron thing and and so and at this point I don't realize how bad I am because they haven't read it yet and so before I'm nervous and they go but that's nothing Strauss and and he writes the comedy reviews for the Orange County edition of the LA Times which is about 6 million people and I'm like oh actually well I wish he had given me a day or two to settle in and so so I do the set and it's not great and it's uh but it's not bad you know I I think I pulled it off you know they laughed at it you know they they laughed at what I'd put together and whatever it was and I expect him to be there to congratulate me on their on how good the set was and shake my hand and do a little interview to build this great interview so but it wasn't there and well okay well then that next night they there's like a know little open mic night before me so there's a in one of the guys I know Steve apps from Texas is on that and and then that night I fucking kill and I'm really drunk and you know and I'm giving advice to other comedians you know because I mean my egos just flare and I'm like I'm probably gonna leave my wife and go find a girl and let the county beer posters and they you know it's amazing and people are patting me on the back on here man you a really really good has amazing I am so I'm staying at the Marriott suites hotel on the bay which is a nice hotel I've ever stayed in and you had to pay for part of it yourself and but that was all I was making I didn't made ever made that much money before it was like fourteen or fifteen hundred dollars and and for a week and and so it's it's it's unbelievably beautiful with a gorgeous view phone bathroom you know two bathrooms big marble everything big nice stuff and they go back after that well the Dow the review comes out in the next morning and I get this massive hangover I'm just so sick drunk waking up going oh Jesus Christ and I just I blink my eyes and start going oh the review the glorious review was out the review that's gotta be touting my praises to the masses all over the this area of Southern California probably the beginning to my hugeness and probably what's gonna happen so it turned out I had bought a bag of popcorn when I was drunk and I followed that bag that popcorn trail from my bed out the door down the hall into the elevator the elevator I got on had popcorn on it so it was the same one I came up in I was just drunk staggering around with a popcorn bag and I followed that now this place is just right down the block from the from the club and when I go to what I'm playing at a club I hang out at the club a lot you know because that's I just those are the people I know anyway those have been my friends forever so and they're still my friends you know I love those so these are people who are working today so I walk in the door and one of the girls that worked there looked at me and she goes don't read it oh and I'm like quiet I think I don't read it right it's not true it isn't true and it's a hatchet job I'm like if it's a what a hatchet job so I'm like now give it to me I said I can read it got you know how bad could it be so there's a big picture of me this pic 6 million people this big it was the article was this big it was a quarter of a page and it said in big black print even when White's not blue he's not funny and I dropped the newspaper on the floor I couldn't hold up a 1 ounce newspaper because the life it didn't be sucked out of me and I also agreed with them and felt like I had just been found out as a phony and I was a phony and I didn't belong here at all and and I picked it up and read it and and it said watching why it's 41 minute show so they were nice enough to point out I didn't I just had to I had to scrape and crawl to get to 41 much less the 45 had agreed to they pointed that out which was like watching a polar bear lumber around on stage and something comical or interesting happening only occasionally now here's why I'm I can quote that all these 29 years later I went across the street to the liquor store and bought a bottle of tequila and a pack of razor blades true story I go back up to my Marriott suites on the bay and set there's this big desk and I'm just drinking this tequila reading it over and over and over and over and I got a big bag of weed and I'm smoking pot and I've convinced myself that they're gonna cancel the show because who would come to a show right with the review like that and and then I'm thinking well they probably have to pay me for the shows I did even you know even though I wasn't able to finish the week right so I just I just assume I'm fired I genuinely believe that in my heart that I'm fired and so I would I wake up from this stupor and I got a drool stain on this fucking article and a half a joint and violet I mean it's dismal shit right it's dark dark time and I walked down there fuck the show sold out both of them are it's comedy and fucking 1990 89 or 90 whatever it was and you know that all the clubs were sold out nobody gave a fuck about that fucking review and they give a shit and then and then I went on stage because I was still a wreck though I'm drunk I just woke up I'm not very good anyway I have no confidence whatsoever I totally agree that I suck and I'm not worth a goddamn thing and I go up there and have the worst set I've ever had a sold-out house and it was just sucked I just sucked it was a horrible and and then the guy that booked me calls the club and they go he goes because he read the fucking article and he goes that's got to be a gut punch I mean it was long there was other shit in it too and then it was good and so then they they they get me on the phone with him and because they asked them they said we just want to see if he's okay and they're like no no he's not okay he's not okay at all I'm like I'm really now I'm now I'm calling my wife going I just want to talk to you because I love you so much I'm thinking about the Ducati beer poster anymore I'm just calling her I just love you I want to be together forever and she's like kind of standoff he's like like she could tell I had a bad review mm-hmm so that that kind of scared me away from LA for a while and I realized then that they were right and I should have been slapped in the face and I wasn't good enough to be on that stage I was not and that guy actually apologized to me one time because I saw him later in live and I'm like no dude you were totally right you were completely right I should have been slapped in the fucking fact three years in you're getting you know I had no business there yeah and and so you know it all worked out the you know the best way it possibly could have been that but that also included a couple slaps in the fucking face going you're you know you know I think those are important I really do I thinking that in the moment those feel bad but every big leap I've made as a comic is after I bombed yeah every big leap for real like the you know someone telling me they had a bad time my show just felt like you were off like fuck that feeling makes me so hungry to figure out how to do it right that's where where it comes from it makes you you know you realize there's urgency to this thing and then over the years part of the fear of bomb is what makes me work so hard on new shit fart of the fear is what makes me do so many sets I'll do two podcasts at night and then I'll do four shows right I'll go to the store other to let the show a store I'll do one or two at the improv I might even go to the ice house or the haha I'll fuck around all these are all the reasons I'm not as good as Joe Rogan right here I get scared I get scared yeah you know I do too and I you know I well I can't I can't tell you it at 62 I do all those sets but I can do I do go out and do such a lot of sets and a lot of guys that are kind of in my you know in my age group really don't come out and do such that much and but I come out do sets and I hang out you're ageless and I don't think of you you know you said that one time in the back room you like I'm older than you guys and we're like we don't give a fuck that doesn't mean anything there's this this this thing is about comedy it doesn't matter if you're lesbian if you're trans if you're from Philadelphia or the Philippines no one gives a fuck are you funny and if you're funny that's all we care about we don't care if you're 90 or 19 I mean I'm one I'm not fucking now coughs key is what is she 22 or some shit she might be 22 she's one of my best friends I love that girl she's goddamn hilarious she's kid we talk all the time we talked about comedy we I have her she hosts my sets of The Improv all the time nobody cares nobody cares about your age they care about comedy Damai rare is the same same way you know nobody thinks that Dahmer arizo Dahmer errors older than us no it's Dahmer eras a goddamn comic he's a monster this is a very very unusual group of humans you really think about the people that we know you know if you looked at the entire population of the planet there's eight billion people or seven-and-a-half is that what it is seven and a half something some crazy shit how many of those are comics is it is it a thousand couple value the real ones how many of them are headline how many of

this is the most significant comedy club in America and I'm like it's the most significant hundred seater you know yeah the idea that that place is more significant than the store is hilarious yeah that's so sick and it's so fun and I love that's great don't get silly right oh yeah don't be really don't get so you're second place by a fucking large margin right come on son Dave Chappelle's up at the fucking store all the time Chris Rock comes by louis c.k I'm sure he'll be back it's a fucking crazy place man you're there daliyah's there Brian count there Joey Diaz there it's one night and

got the stamp of approval you might actually have a career like I wasn't sure if I was gonna have a career in comedy which hilarious is I was on the sitcom at the time I was out here to do a television show for Fox I had done I've been on Showtime already done I'd headlined a lot of clubs all over the country probably prematurely I'd really only been doing stand-up for 6 years but uh you know I had maybe a good 10 15 minutes I could I could actually do a real solid half-hour if I had to but 15 minutes I could really kill with and to be able to do a set in front of her and she goes you're a paid regular I was like I'm a fucking comedian I'm a holy shit you've you've been given the nod I thought it was a firm aid man even when I was saying that even when she said I was like damn I tricked her I tricked those people in the audience I tricked her that's how I felt I felt like at Richter if I get tricked everybody but everybody tricks everybody in the beginning yeah after the beginning is that what yeah it's good that you didn't trick them those hard hits they're important Morton stuff eating shit on stage is critical if you if you you can't accept the fact that it's a process you can't want everything to happen right away and the only way for you to be really sure that it's not happening yet is to bomb right yeah there's no other nothing other nothing tells you succinctly that you're doing it wrong like eating shit on stage right and you kind of learn a lot from it every day as you go you know in that you know you don't really mess around that much with comedies being you you don't want to play a football stadium or whatever I do what's the biggest place you've ever performed at well bucolic ami ture we held the the record where the Predators play hockey and in Nashville and how many people's not 20,000 and and Elton John held the record before we broke it and the reason we broke it as we were in a center stage in the middle and there's only four of us doing stand-up so it was nobody will ever have a smaller stage Wow for the Celerio there right right how could they and that was right before we filmed blue collar one two uh Josh wolf showed me a picture when you opened up for Larry the Cable Guy he will open up with some football arena he's on stage and he takes it like a selfie out looking at the audience it's the craziest thing you've ever seen in your life see if you could find it Josh wolf opening up for Larry the Cable Guy selfie it's I don't even know if he put it online he showed it to me on his phone it's fucking bananas there's 50,000 people there you know 50,000 oh yeah it was doing he's doing crazy crazy crazy numbers insane number like and didn't even talk about it you know there was a lot of people that are hating on him he couldn't be a nicer guy he's also a great pace rhythm and timing one letter yes you know and as good as I guess I've seen him just be crowds to death funny dude and and gifted and also has done it you know he's totally paid his dues you hundred percent I met him in 92 I feel you've known him longer night holy shit look at that fuck yeah I haven't played this place look at that fucking crowd that's gotta be the braska right so right everybody's gotta be state I'm in Lincoln Nebraska that is one of the most insane crowds I've ever seen in my life but it makes sense he's got great fucking timing man and I met him like I said in 92 I think that the comedy works and Montreal when Jimbo used to run the joint and he was a great guy man back then even back then he was a I think he was such a radio personality in Florida at that time you know he's just and that never the Cable Guy was a character he did in that and that he would bring in to a show for one joke and and then I just took over fucking crazy and people don't know like he's Dan Whitney he's like a regular person right regular comic yeah but he's trapped right he is Larry the traffic the way she's like to be trapped right oh yeah am I making thirty million dollars a year but it's like this marvelous missus Mazal thing except he's that's who he actually is I mean he doesn't have to wear a fat suit or anything crazy but lowest you know his dad was a preacher and a pig farmer from Nebraska and and say does this a great auctioneer voice where lawyers sold a little Danny Whitney from across the street Wow a preacher in a pig farmer holy shit hmm speaking of pigs if the pigs just keep coming back yeah yeah the thing is you can't save the pigs you gotta kill some of them you gotta you know what that hears through the ultimate conundrum because like it would be nice if we could have like some sort of harmony with nature with pigs but that's not possible if they're wild they're fucking up a storm they're having two three litters a year with six to eight little piglets and they're just running rampant there there's they come viable I think correct me if I'm wrong I think female pigs become viable and yet pregnant after four months less you're exactly right that's why they make these little bitty pigs and they have these little bitty pigs too and there's a cutest things I've ever seen in my hair oh they're adorable and I said can I pick one up and they're like they squeal like a pig you know and literally I picked one up and they like they made a noise like I was stabbing a screwdriver into their ear and I'm like okay alright well they're smart there's they get scared they're smart it's so it's a crazy thing because like you want to love them but then if they're taking over your neighborhood you want to fucking shoot them and kill them they're delicious and there's ocean yes that's their problem right that's the whole problem they're delicious you know how they got into California no William Randolph Hearst oh yeah that crazy asshole he used to bring them and he would populate his forest outside of his home with wild pigs up in wild boars ruff go out and fucking shoot them like so if you go to like tattoo P or any of these areas that have wild pigs leave go to certain areas towards the middle of near Bakersfield there's wild pigs out there oh yeah that's all William Randolph it's wild pigs thanks Bill yeah that crazy asshole he let pigs loose in California they're everywhere Big Sur like Hunter has Thompson used to hunt wild boar and Big Sur with a fucking machine gun those were William Randolph Hearst wild pigs that had populated all the way among coast all the way up the coast all the way up San Jose there was a fucking news story from San Jose where they were knocking over people's trash cans like a huge tech community 800-pound pig Mowen that would be most answer me loud ones aren't that big the wild ones are like a big wild ones like 300 pounds the bit really big on Georgia they're there you know what happens there though they're domesticated and then people let them go see don't look at this up on the computer don't fuck up my fucking stories your truth no no I know about this huge one thing I do know about is feral pigs I've studied them pretty pretty closely why because I'm friends with a lot of people that are professional hunters okay and I wanted to know how the fuck they got so big like there's a video of there's a photo rather one they called Hogzilla that was from Georgia it's all right fucking enormous pig but it looked it way look at that motherfucker King Kong hog from Russia makes hogs ooh look like a baby see I'm not buying that for that guy look at the guy's head see that guy's head that guy's a mile away where the fuck is that guy that guy could be on top of that thinking that looks like a German Shepherd is away we have no idea this is a photograph well hold on let me see that tusks again let me see the tusks that's a big pig but it doesn't have to be that big that could be a 300 400 pound big it doesn't even say did they weigh it 1117 scales what would website is this i've got scales whoops website is it's wide open spaces hmm that's a pretty reputable well that's not all there's a shoulder head yeah first by having at five and a half feet at the shoulder oh Christ I gotta see the picture he brought 200 of these not specifically that one but it was a Russian boar hmm he brought in from Russia and they've ended up breeding with local feral pigs yeah and they got big yeah well here's the thing about boars and pigs and all that jazz it all comes from the same genus it's all from something called Sioux scrofa Seuss Gravas all pigs what's crazy about that is like when you see a domestic pig and they look all cute and cuddly and pink and shit right when they get loose and they go wandering through the woods they turn feral and their face changes their face gets longer they grow tusks their hair gets thicker this one it says the shoulder height is that how high the shoulders are off the ground right five and a half that's so big that's all I'm three inches shorter than or taller than that five and a half feet that's insane that's this tall on me so me standing out account 5/8 look at this watch this here's those pigs here's the pigs shoulder right right here that's fucking insane that's a pig that high that's insane that's an elk hogs Hogzilla was a shoulder height of three feet that's almost double five and a half feet tall that's so big but if it was a thousand pounds that makes sense because a good elk is like 800 pounds right no yeah hunters trick hunters traits back where I don't seize hands do you see his hands I don't you say that anymore that's me look at it listen that guy isn't 1106 area code that guy's hiding he's way behind that thing you're supposed to be right next to it and if that is a deceptive photo when you take a photo like that that is you doing that on purpose well you're supposed to do is supposed to put your gun or your or your or your bow and arrow you lean it on the animal you stand next to it so that people that know how difficult it is if people say oh you're true a few hundred no you're trying to kill a smart mature animal because that's the one that's healthiest for the population that's the one you want to take out of the breeding cycle this is one that's already spread its genes and hunters respect when someone shoots a mature older animal that's a I'm sure it looks good right I'm hungry those are not that good to eat unless you really know what the fuck you're doing are you gonna be gonna slow-cook that motherfucker that one you want to do low you want to probably you gonna brine that bitch get them in a big ole data saltwater with brown sugar and garlic and let them soak for a while this article I sort of saying it could be bullshit could be bullshit I'm telling that guy's gonna fart away you got to listen to me first you see a guy that's that far away what do you say to a Russian bro is that guys near the bumper that's a hell of a car lie abettor pig's head look at where his shoulders are they line up almost with the tiny he's way behind that pig in relation to the size of the car exactly he's like a third grader exactly doesn't make sense yeah this guy is hiding he's hiding behind that pig if you wanted people to know the actual perspective you'd lay on the pig if he had a rifle leaning up against that pig and the rifle look tiny you'd be like holy shit that's a giant pig that's yeah but there's nothing in that photo that represents an actual perspective you would have to be standing right he's hiding he's he was holy bitch you could see that ain't a five and a half foot tall Pig well that picked six one laying down in this picture yeah this is the only evidence they have one that means that the werewolf we haven't not and the lobby could be real to that where was a thousand pounds it's even bigger than this pig yeah that's stupid that's what people do man people take pictures of animals they hide what it's a it's in the hunting worlds call the grip and grin take a photo you hold a deer and you look push them way out people do that with fish too like you caught a big bass and take that big bass you put it way in front of you it looks gigantic right if you take that big bass a take a look at my big bass right that's a confident person right confident persons got that best behind them motherfucker do you know how big that is wrong bigger wrong guessing doesn't matter this guy's a liar the guy was holding it out in front of him he showboating not buying Joe Bowden that fucking pigs 300 pounds that's a baby pig that's been waiting Joe Rogan's her against it Whitney Cummings pigs brothers and sisters got lose they shot it so I saw her right after that I thought oh good so I'm like you're not gonna believe this shit to Whitney I have pictures of your pig just to her on the phone and she just flipped the fuck out yeah yeah she's uh that lady loves animals for real she's yeah whoo god bless her fiance he's in for a long run of animal husbandry laughs my friend's wife if she sees an animal that's dead and it's winter so bury it she'll put it in her freezer oh god wait for the thaw nande varriya and they wait for the ground to thaw and then dig all over it Jesus that's deep wouldn't you wouldn't do that no lady yeah that's taking it to the next level you gotta accept there's a cycle of life you don't have to like just leave it outside for something to eat yeah that's what you're supposed to do what I do well it's there's a reason for that those animals they need to stay alive to the animals that eat dead animals they need to stay alive to right is the whole cycle just not just vultures rats you know there's a lot of carry a lot of other stuff that SCAP interesting is this show his drunker and drunker I Grow Meyer lemons in my place and so I look at the lemons and something is eating the rind off the lemon and left the lemon hanging on the tree perf in perfect condition huh and I'm like well that's odd and then I see a one little group of perfectly appealed lemons on the ground and then there's two more lemon pods on the tree perfect lemons no right and like what the fuck is this this is yesterday this house this house but yesterday there's an memory from the past which I have almost none of but yesterday and so we looked it up and it's it's called a roof rat and they loved it they loved specifically Meyer lemons which is what these were and they loved the the ride but they don't like the sourness of the of the fruit so they just eat the they just eat the rind and leave the fruit hanging on the tree and it's it was just baffling really when I first thought but that's not they do the exact opposite with oranges right and we also have blood oranges and so would they'll put a little hole in the meat all the fruit out of and leave the husk and all the tree was does on the inside I'm like Jesus Christ fucking dicks so now when I eat an orange or a lamb or whatever I'm like throw the rides out there save the fucking fruit you know I really don't know why I don't like to kill anything I have a peach tree I maybe eight three peaches the whole time I've been living in this fucking house I believe in that house it's 2003 these goddamn squirrels eat my peaches all right they eat every fucking peach I've ever grown look at that look at these rats look at well that's what's left there they dug a hole in that shit I'd literally never get to eat peaches all these things going on in my house right now okay Ron folks they're called roof rat I got serious coyote problems yeah I have no more chickens Tiger I've killed all my chickens in one fell swoop you ready for this they killed the last nine chickens I had to transfer to him them because my chicken coop burnt to the ground so we had to get a smaller coop and you're blaming that on the Chi oh no no all right we the chickens escaped and we saved the chickens and we got them to this other coop after the fire and it wasn't as reinforced as the original coop the original coop I had hired a guy who's a carpenter to build me a nice coop and he did a great job and the Coyotes were on the roof one night chewing at it and I had a fucking I had a death perch setup on my porch I had my Hoyt out there I had arrows rangefinder I even I even laid bait out in my yard waiting for these cunts I was ready I was gonna Rambo ok but I lost my patience and I'm a busy man so I abandon the project right fire burnt my fucking chicken coop down to the ground we put these chickens and another coop in these coyotes tour that coop apart and they did it when we weren't home and we came home as just feathers they were all gone all 9 of them there you know part of me admires them you know part of me is like these little wolves are surviving in the suburbs there's trying to figure this shit out right now man they gonna break into this thing or die my wife was getting uncomfortable because you're basically making your house a target you know they're on the roof right next to the house these little small predators are chewing at the roof of the chicken coop before the fire happened and it was like oh that was when I decided to go to war I didn't fully committed to war cuz I didn't get I was gonna get a subsonic 22 that's the way to go cuz that you were here subsonic 22 it sounds like this pack pack doesn't sound like anything but it's lethal I had a coyote but I don't think it's legal inside City Limits I don't even think I should be saying that I wanted to shred it you know with a with a rifle it's probably like a like a criminal intent idea but I never really considered it and I definitely never bought one but I was ready to fuck one up with a bow and arrow but now it's over and they got they won they figured it out the fire opened up the door and they after the fire was they were real sketchy real loud and because they were trying to figure out what the fuck is going on because like all the brush was gone so probably the rabbits were missing and the rack of course there were yeah yeah it was uh it's weird but came you know came home and see just feathers everywhere man just feathers like just like someone just sliced a few pillows and just shook them all over the yard like fuck you know we should look back and and try to figure out what we should have closed with that's a good way to close
