the gyro can experience a lot of people believe it's a controlled demolition I don't think necessarily she is saying that it is or it isn't and I and I certainly am NOT I don't know I don't understand you know what I believe more it was a controlled demolition yes but with it by us yes oh yeah I mean thanked I think that's always been the case of the the argument I don't think it was done by the terrorists right they think see honey no no building to the tear wouldn't know what if the terrorists oh if they did a control - and yeah it wasn't like if somehow they had tears I mean if the terrace probably could easily I think I would probably before hijacking planes and flying them into buildings before that would be putting a bomb in the building yes it's not that easy see like when you see what would happen in Oklahoma City dad that was multiple bombs you know in Oklahoma City they actually there was all these reports of the FBI removing bombs from the building like that didn't explode and if you talk to these guys that are demolition experts they say there's no way that was a fertilizer bomb there's no fucking way right like they would they said that if you look at the amount of damage that did and look at where the blast radius is from the way he blows out it doesn't blow they're not designed it and you're saying yeah that's building because we've all seen the loose change work you watch the lights go off around the building yeah like one floor by one yeah but see they don't know that see they don't know what that means though that also could be if the ceiling is coming in and slamming into the floor all the windows would do that they don't know that that's explosions if it really was collapsing like that see no one's ever seen a building collapse like that so when they say that those are blips and those are squibs I don't like that because then I'm saying you're saying you know for sure what that is and I'm saying the fuck you do I don't know even even someone's got it just because someone has to know I'm not saying it was as I'm not saying it was an inside job it just seems odd ergonomically that you would design a building that if impacted at a certain point the entire thing would demolish like what structurally what purpose does that serve well the we are yeah the weird look could just be incompetence that's possible if you look at humans that's our most likely option right I mean when does they make your World Trade Center so fucking long as time ago the get so cocky to build a building that's 100 goddamn storeys high right and how long did they think that was gonna stay up there for you know what if it started falling apart and rotting what it was they're just so just a wonky piece of shit by the time we got hit by those planes yeah that's totally true I mean yeah this fucking thing was old as shit that thing was around that's black and white television essica Lion King Kong I mean yeah but what's retro fishiness the cheapest goddamn floor and the cheapest got bitter you know that you do that how many for it with bombs well that's the crazy idea what we're saying about building seven or more the other building like terrorists could have done it I mean I guess they could have but how the fuck are they gonna get in there and put all those explosives in it's like dynamite a time there's red sticks of dynamite one of a sign up your ass you're working the fucking thing five years in this closet sticks you're walking down the hallway you just smell shit open this door what's in this just smells like shit and it says shitty dynamite sticks it's like a fucking log house built with shit and dynamite sticks yeah and little Harris he matric a pee mattress
