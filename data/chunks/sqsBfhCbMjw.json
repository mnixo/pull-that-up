du monde jessiemae Rogan good to see you Joseph do people call you Joseph my mom does oh that's sweet what's your middle name James Joseph James sounds like an author hmm may best write books I can't believe you ever write in a book I tried started doing one a long time ago I had a deal for a book like 12 years ago and dealing with the editors was so gross they wanted they basically wanted me to just transcribe stand-up and I wanted to write a bunch of weird shit didn't Judy Carter already do that remember the dude is that the worst genre ever books on how to do stand-up they might be piss-poor books ever Belzer had a pretty good one Belzer had a decent one I think it was what we had a couple of them he had one on stand-up he had one on UFOs Bigfoot and JFK Belzer is a cool things all go together do you know him personally but I mean he's a legend for sure he's he's a crazy conspiracy theorist except the deep end yeah yeah is he like Radim with Sam Tripoli is it just as crazy no maybe more Wow yeah he's he's I don't know if they believe in the same things because it's funny like there's like classifications of conspiracy theorists like some conspiracy theories our bald balls-deep in like JFK but you try to bring up 5gb they like get the fuck out of here so was Marilyn Monroe yeah deep in JFK sex joke I mean well I guess he was balls deep in her but I mean who knows who knows they were into behind closed doors she could have strapped one that's a good good at conspiracy theory - do you think they killed her oh yeah absolutely snitches get stitches bitches who are snitches get stitches yeah or no stitches cuz you're just dead yeah you're dead you get the ultimate stitch of life which is just done what if it really killed her hey so if you were gonna write a book today what would it be about oh I don't know if I would do it today I don't know maybe that maybe this is what I should be doing right now during this covert time but I'm using it as an excuse to know just know I'm not I'm not working on standing up at all Wow first time in forever four no writing I haven't written anything do you feel like it's relaxing or do you feel any anxiety about having that detach from your day to day routine that's not the anxiety the anxiety is the world the anxiety is what what's happening right general existentialism well just the fact that the economy has come to a complete screeching halt and all these people are losing their jobs and all these people are losing their businesses and we're not exactly sure what to do because there's the hard core people that are like fuck it open it up keep the women in the old people safe make you so weak okay why are we grouped into old I made that up what people are yeah which we should be for sure yeah and the Titanic we were paint me like your little french girl meanwhile my team both get on that fucking raft I know why on top of each other you see making out picked his little frozen hands off and shoved them into the belly of the ocean get a sign on the paper first nice drawing you could write something about parenting I mean it must be interesting for you to be raising daughters in this climate well I think raising sons in this climate be just as interesting just as weird just raising humans in this climate when no one's ever done before racing raising kids with full-time electronics and the internet from the time they're babies you know what's the good stuff is you can't bullshit people as much you know there's like access to information like we're trying to figure out today just now how many people died in the 1918 flu and you said it best you like there's no end unanswered questions anymore you can't ponder ya wondering and wonderment is a thing of the past it's gone it's still there but you got you can get answers you know it's like you get searched shit down and get answers but what it was it the number like 50 million died yeah totally that's that's I mean that's a huge number but the thing that we were talking about also is I I guess I just don't understand that this disease has a lot of unknown factors but there are so many other things that are detrimental to our society that it's wild that this it took this sort of situation to bring everything to a screeching halt globally it's a little scary and it's scary that we're using so much resources to deal with it I know we need to but then okay after this are we gonna start to apply those resources to deal with you know child sex trafficking that happens in the country to deal with homelessness to deal with these other issues is this gonna be a sort of Kickstarter to be like okay let's get our shit together as a global society instead of living in our own tribal existences which doesn't work it doesn't work anymore I'm sorry you made me you made me smoke the blunt yeah but you're right you're right maybe that is what we'll do next maybe listen 500,000 people in this country alone die prematurely because of cigarettes and we're just like well you know whatever imagine if it was kool-aid if kool-aid was killing half a million a year but yes it does it does but not as clearly as cigarettes like you could be healthy and occasionally enjoy kool-aid I agree but don't you think sugars just as addictive as an addictive you're right if we look at it from a broader spectrum they're both equally is bad and killed just as many people did I see what you're saying I don't think they kill as many because I think heart attacks is higher right now I guess you would have to lump diabetes in there too you would absolutely so heart attacks was number one it took over Kovach took the number one spot on the chart coming in number 19 straight out of Wu Han he's quick with the slips yeah killin bitches and sneaky yes sneaky disease that kills healthy people and then old people survive it like it's nothing and then it kills an entire nursing home full of people and then young people get it and and die from it and old people get it and brush it off and some people have zero symptoms at all as many as 50 percent or more that's wild it's like the crack of diseases it is it does have a lot of characteristics of multiple diseases and that's why that's a scary factor for me but I'm always grossed out I mean you and I travel we used to remember what remember comedy are you enjoying the not flying almost fuck yeah how good is it for your body dude I feel like I look like 15 now I'm like ah I'm chilling I got my plumpness back and sleep is amazing to do farticles anymore in fucking airplanes oh god dude there's so I don't know what it is about flying I'm sure it's the pressure and the pressurized cabin loved to fart God they let it rip on airplanes and that that's kovat in my face I'm fine with dealing with the farts anymore killing people farts were killing people if a guy could fart in a plane and half the people on the plane died you should have met my dad a couple of those cookies would have ripped you right out of here there's something about old man farts oh they're great they're legendary yeah you know there's something funny about when you walk into a supermarket right behind an old guy who crop-dusted you like no you can't be mad at him that that fart went to Vietnam that was a fart that maybe you know fought some Wars he deserves it people that have been through war I've gotta be like what are we doing you know I mean like have you been through war and everyone shot the disease down people are coughing wait this is what we're worried about obviously it's a terrible disease I'm making light of it but it's a terrible disease sometime which is weird it's like you know car accidents are car accidents right your car gets hit by a train it's the same thing every time yeah it's an isolated situation but it's it's terrible every time every test is terrible like like a car hitting a train sometimes people just die and then for other people it's literally nothing yeah it's really wild it's an inconsistent disease and it's also I just don't understand how much longer we're gonna be shut down I mean the economy is struggling so much over this fucking disease not just struggling like broken yes rebuild it and it could take a long time scares me listen to these experts talk about it what scares you the most about the current situation well it's always gonna be a new disease and loss of life that's number one right so number one is we're all scared because this disease is super infectious it's just running through like old folks homes there was one old folks home I believe they said 70 people died and one old folks home and that's terrible on another level because those people can't bury their family the way they need to or want to the grieving process is interrupted by the protocol yeah you can't even visit him in the hospital yeah that's that's really brutal and that for that fact it makes me really sad for families that are losing loved ones like that older people that's why it's so crazy it's almost like and this is a ridiculous way to put it but I'm gonna do it anyway do it if if you were intact if this country was attacked by an invasion of demons and they were all anything sorry-sorry continue you're making a good point that's what it would be like it's like some people don't even get haunted yeah some people some people just get a little bit of a demon and then some people get the full wrath of Satan himself that's a good point it's just it's I was reading about this guy who was on an incubator for more than 30 days and it was a terrifying account of all the it was in Massachusetts with all these different ways they were doing different methods they were doing to try to revive this guy and to thing I mean one thing it made me think is like thank God there's people out there that can do this that know how does how to keep a guy like this a lot yeah guy who was a young guy was like in his late 30s I believe maybe 40s and he was married with little kids and you know it was a terrible story but they figured it out and they used some crazy machine that was bypassing his heart in his lungs like it had to go in through his leg and like like into a major artery and shit like that and they had to keep him like basically in a coma like so that he doesn't move like an induced coma to keep him yes they're just trying to pump air into him oh my god it's terrifying yeah that is terrifying that's why this disease is so strange it is I I laugh because it's you made a good point about we're lucky to have people who know how to handle this I feel like that you know with social media and everything those jobs are not as appealing to people and who knows in like 50 years of another thing like this and we're lucky enough to be alive and it hits us and Instagram influencers aren't going to be able to intubate anybody you know what I mean like the girl self it t won't be able to help us and imagine if your job was if you thought your job was to help people which is what most nurses and first responders mean their job is hey you know I'm gonna do a good thing for the community I'm gonna go do a good thing for people I'm gonna be there to help people when they're ill I'm gonna treat them I'm gonna help them survive and recover like that's a beautiful thing but to go from that to all the sudden you're on the front line of this infectious infectious virus war and you could get bit you could get bit and there's not enough PPE in all these places and it's really scary that's just scariest part we don't even have the fucking equipment for these people more equipment now than they ever had before but they just never saw this coming and you know there was a pandemic Department apparently and it was what do we know about that was it was cancelled during the the Trump administration they cancelled the pandemic believe me what I read was that there was like a team in place what at the transition that since that time which would have been three years ago by now those people are no longer at the jobs that they had so they would have probably had other positions maybe in the White House or other places but does the actual position exist anymore I don't from what I read know or like I don't even know if it was like at an actual position it was it's hard to not think about conspiracy when you hear that that team was just shut down and that department was just shut down and then this happens I'm not a big conspiracy theorist but I understand where people might go wait a minute hold on I know what you're saying yeah I don't think it's a conspiracy I think it's incompetence I think you know there's been scientists for years even Bill Gates Bill Gates and I think it was 2015 a very famous it was a 2015 did that TED talk oh yeah that TED talk about saying how it wasn't gonna be like war it was gonna be about a microscopic war yeah yeah which is what we're at right this I've heard this from so many independent sources I think that's exactly what it is really I think they just didn't see it coming and it's just incompetence they didn't treat it with the respect it deserved because it's not in their face yeah right if you're if you're a person deciding what to spend money on and you're running something like the and states of america there's some fucking wacky decisions you have to make you know and someone whoever it was made the call that we don't need that we don't even know if that's true maybe the money was diverted or it was diverted into some sort of another program or something but they just didn't see it coming that's it would be hard to see something like this coming and it's like preparing for this thing that you can't imagine would be hard to prepare for and it's it's gonna be an interesting thing because like for our ability to look back at ancient civilizations it's a little difficult because of the lack of technology available then to record incidents happening but for us right now this is all being recorded and maybe there'll be a differentiation in the advancements with technology but I wonder what future generations are going to know and decipher from this situation that we're in right now like didn't they see that coming you know that sort of situation where they're like how do they not see this happening how do they not know this was gonna happen because we have a really weird inability to pay attention to anything that doesn't affect us immediately yeah it's very strange but it says it's a characteristic of human beings that's probably got some sort of evolutionary benefit like concentrate on what you're concentrating on don't see the big picture because if you see the big picture you're gonna go while I even bothering I'm a finite life-form on a planet with a dying star floating through infinity try not to get eaten yeah right it's a survival mechanism there's something about it like your brain has too much ability to comprehend and if you comprehend everything like just the nature of life itself the fact that you're your body is this ecosystem with all this different stuff inside your book because you collectively like however they influence you however your microbiome influences you collectively are you and you know that you just assume that there's one but meanwhile it's this crazy fucking world it's all interconnected never talk to your cells I do I say that like in a sense of I think I think my existence in my being for for taking care of me like I express gratitude to myself on a scopic level on a molecular level like talking to plants and plants yeah say that that's real right like if you play plants music they actually grow I wonder if there's plants that like car DB much isn't it all just like really yeah but was there a study on absolutely nothing no more flourish li they flourish li is that a word they flourish more with with music in their growing process have you ever been high in a grow up I don't even know what you just said to me high in a grow up like a grown oh oh actually yes I take it back my partners grow up I was inside a little bit stoned it feels nice yes one of the earliest studies the effect of music on plants was conducted in 1962 by dr. T C Singh head of botany and at animal iya animal university he exposed balsam plants to classical music and found that their growth rate increased by 20% compared to a control group along with 72% increase in biomass 72 percent increase in biomass from playing music but even that 20% that's a huge huge number and imagine like what that does to plants I mean we already know their science that it helps babies and you know fetuses and babies inside the womb to listen to classical music and things like that so it's interesting I wonder what the rate of of helping a baby grow is what the percentage is no shit right I wonder if you could play Beethoven for your kid when it's like a tiny little baby hoots in a crib what if it increases its intelligence I wonder I wonder if it would do you think it would be an exercise right because the kid would be favorable along with these beats so the thing to like really complex classical music is like I don't know about you but I don't play shit I have zero musical talent I did I have none I think I can do like a finger flute I love the fact that I don't know anything about how they do it so I could just enjoy it like just enjoy the music without thinking about the technical details of it yeah it must be a little stressful if you know how it goes right to obsess over that over the notes oh yeah be like us with jicama why would he go that way why would he to go this way you know to be like it would be like us if you're watching someone play a comic in a movie oh right yeah you're like you did it all wrong yeah that was so terrible so if you were a guitarist and then they're doing a movie on Hendrix like what are you gonna do with the fingers what do you do because you're not gonna come around aimlessly yeah you're not gonna you have to actually know how to play guitar if you want to play Hendrix in a movie am i right no you're right but also so many people have such different technique that you'd look at some people like that said that's not how you play that but you hear it and it sounds exactly right yeah because the way they develop there's someone who faked it better than almost anybody Will Smith when he paid Mohammed Ali I wanna say faked it I said would say acted came like a boxer like I've seen so many fights when someone moves you ah come on with that oh you're talking about the actual choreography of his movement his movement see I never saw that movie but I know it was a good one oh I thought you were gonna say like because we're talking about music like Jamie Foxx with Ray but I don't know yeah I can do any I know Jamie Foxx is amazing weirdly Tyler yeah if you listen to his voice oh you can do that too yeah he is a very very talented dude very funny you did the cello thing too though like he'd like made you seem it seemed like he was learnt but maybe he did but a master cello player in them yeah Robert Downey jr. yeah that's right the guy was like homeless yeah we can google it see he can really do that like it's not like like if someone asked me to play a guitarist I don't know what you're supposed to do with your hand it's gonna be like I don't know what to do with you ever see a movie where you could tell someone does it really smoke and they're smoking cigarettes in a movie but just look so your hand yeah actors talk about that too like they'll actually if their character smoke cigarettes they'll actually smoke cigarettes yeah you can get comfortable with the fact they have a cigarette and even then they feel like a fake well I think because so much of our mechanism is dependent upon our personality type you know it's not necessarily everyone smokes a certain way it's just like how do you stand like where are you are you leaning or how do you eat you know they do posture it's gonna affect the way you do things there's a thing that you can see in someone that's doing something awkward there's a weird thing if they're not really good at it and it's like like I play pool and when you watch someone play pool in a movie and you're supposed to be an amazing pool player like bitch get the fuck out you like that Martin seconds which one the hustler no with we're talking money color money yeah the classic pool movie yeah that's a movie that's an amazing movie that's actually the sequel to the hustler oh yeah the hustler I've read the books they're really book author forget the author you read a lot do you when did you every four anymore mostly what I do is listen to books on tape is that considered reading I mean my question you listen and you say you read [Laughter] Ari Shaffir wrote on my Instagram something some fucking comic books don't have tracks or so yeah yeah yeah that's funny but I mean if you're in school and you're getting a lecture you're learning yeah yeah listen it's not it's not the same but I can do when I workout so I can listen to books while I work out do you think you retain information better when you're like working out and doing physical exerting things physically exerting no I think you retain the most information when you're sitting there concentrating on retaining information you retained less but you you could still do it you seem really able to acquire and retain a lot of information it's scattered though it's like I have all my hard drives are fucked up Jim pansies brain right supposed to thee I'm supposed to have you know like a few categories of things that I concentrate on that's what my brains designed for but I've taken it like like if you try and put a big engine in a Volkswagen bug I'm just cramming informations that I said of horsepower I'm trying to cram information there's chimp brain do you get headaches from it I've had friends that have had migraines and it seems like probably one of the the most disturbing things you can experience yeah there's so many other physical symptoms that are associated with migraines that just the migraine itself everything else seems so much worse I've had friends that say it's like literally like their heads in a vise and it'll last for an hour yeah that's brutal do you have any like physical issues I know you have like a like a joint issue or a bad name I've always got something wrong from fighting yeah there's always something wrong was there anything congenital no no nothing no everything was just from just use and abuse but like I'm 52 and for most guys that are 52 that still get involved in jiu-jitsu they've got a bunch of surgeries most guys have like back surgery or shoulder surgery or knee surgery almost every guy that I know that gets into like its 40s and 50s from you Jitsu it must be like a midlife crisis choice where you're just like I gotta I gotta try this thing and challenge myself I'm a man I go to good in the ring you couldn't use it that way but it's more like a life challenge oh the way I look at it it's like a really difficult thing to do and in doing really difficult things and increases your capacity to do other things and it also occupies your mind with real drama it's really dangerous it's really dangerous I mean it's not dangerous in the fact that you're gonna get hurt you might get hurt but it's most most of the time we train you don't but I mean it's dangerous and that this guy is trying to kill you he will tap you out you'll tap and you'll give up and then you go again you're not gonna die you're not gonna get hurt but the reality is he could have killed you if somebody gets you in an armbar they're going to break your fucking arm if they get you in a triangle they're gonna put you to sleep and strangle you to death are you flirting does that sounds great my point Jesse man when you do that it makes other things easier yeah they're the people that get good at jujitsu men and women they have a tolerance for the hardships of life that's built into them from training sessions that other people don't have when you're constantly you're a woman you're constantly grappling with this others bitches is trying to kill you you're good friends and they're getting on top of you and she's trying Stranglers try getting your in a rear naked choke yeah like not today motherfucker and you're doing this all the time like regular nonsense out in the street it must be a great way to folk your stresses and Inger's in your everyday existence and sort of funnel them into this instead of that I think it avoids a lot of the anger I think a lot of like frustration that a lot of people have the tension is like built-up energy that they need to expand they need to expel they need to get it out of their system and they don't get a chance to they're stuck in offices they're stuck in their car they're stuck at home wherever they are I don't know if it's not they don't get a chance to they don't decide to implement it into their life somehow there's there's a choice to make and I realize there are limitations to people's lives in certain situations but it's a choice to implement something like this where you can deal with your anger for sure is necessary here's why it's a weird choice it is a choice but you know it's not normal or healthy to sit in a chair all day no it's not everybody's being forced to do that and it's a weird thing to decide that we got to do I mean that's why there's so many suicides in Chinese culture isn't that like in Japanese cultures too because ours too right okay what they're sitting in a desk all day long jumping out of their windows because of the stress of the workweek imagine the feeling when you make that jump you probably regret it this job each time you're like this is a good choice milk was a bad choice and so was jumping out of the window that's a crazy way to go it is how crazy is that Foxconn place where they make the iPhone so they had to put Nets around because so many people were jumping I mean at least they're evolving you know wouldn't be fun if they put a trampoline then you can just kind of jump around and deal with your emotions and that like I guess it was a good thing that I didn't do it but I didn't die they have dorms there and everything like why can't we make an American cellphone is that impossible or we have to pollute everything not know bullshit like Nobel I don't know why everything gets made over there other than cheap labor that's why it is but the other question could be is it also because they don't have the same environmental concerns also now and I know that if you're in some of those cities the the smog is fucking insane right some of the worst air conditions in the world you'll experience in these cities where they make all this shit they don't fuck about the about nature like here's the deal can we even have all the stuff we have over here and make it over here and not have all that waste and not pollute the world was that can I ask you a question this is make any sense it does it does make sense but don't you think we make too much shit do we need a new car every year no we don't need a new phone every year either we don't need a new shit every year you talk about the waste it's only 11 and you could have this for five years like if this is all I could do on the phone was call him and make pictures and fucking shit they do normally and send text messages why do I need do I really need something better than right why don't you do one keep making this just keep making this right I I think we're producing too much she's gonna be intertwined with this thing fuck yeah you're talking about that app about the tracking the Cova tracking the DA which is just it sounds scary to me get the fucker that's an NSA shit that's really scary they're gonna keep going this is what things do they like if it's your job to try to do something like this to try to implement something we can get people to agree to tracking if it's your job to do that you're gonna keep going yes we are once you get that tracking then you're gonna want some new shit then you want cameras in front of people's houses to see if they really are quarantine and you know they're doing that in China yes this guy just got back from a trip in China they gave him a 14-day quarantine and they put a fucking camera right in front of his door that's weird whoa like you're not going anywhere for 14 days and we're watching you it's also strange for people in politics to encourage society to snitch on people that's weird that's a level of tracking that's army I know but don't you think that's fucking weird and wrong it's weird and wrong but it's even worse if you're offering rewards as you're saying if you're saying in usually snitches get stitches but this one guys are gonna get riches you know what it is Joe honestly it's it's a behavior change it's a weird step towards this tracking system that's going to be implemented but right they're starting to be like oh it's okay we're going to reinforce you guys being stitches it's it snitches it's fine here's a little treat for you here's 500 bucks for letting me know that Karen was out not doing the proper protocol meanwhile there's there have been that many deaths like relatively to what they thought they were going to be and so that means it's a success so that means the way it's being implemented so far has been a success like you're getting it more aggressive with it even though the numbers are way lower than we thought they were going to be what are we doing George we're doing the right thing understand that it's hard for people if just you know keep an eye on each other don't let people do stupid shit you shouldn't have fucking parties but you also shouldn't give people rewards to snitch no that's not a house party the other day where people had masks on and he posts all day long the funniest shit he really does a house party was packed yeah it was a packed house party I think it said something like if these people ain't dead in 14 days I'm gonna go out there partying in my apartment as well like not my personally but the building people have been having house parties having them chillin I hear there's cards against humanity' happening a lot oh my god it's wild and like you see the beach don't nobody from this house partied I'm 14 days I'm going outside and also why is it so bright well it looks more like a meeting that just let out and in a in a business maybe it is maybe this is bullshit that's the thing well maybe someone turn the lights on and take a picture how do we know these photos so many photos are doctors like you talk about the the picture from the the beach how do we even know what date that's from I'm sure a lot of these things you can sort of track but then they posted a picture about you know the state the anti stay home protesters it was a photo from like an election from 2011 one thing I saw I think that's just lazy journalism that just clickbait people but that's interesting you see the deep fake of Biden's tongue did you see that category there's a crazy deep thing where they took Biden his thing where he's doing this press conference and they made him move his eyebrows and stick his tongue out in this really wacky way and when I saw it I was like it's really doing that and I'm like I don't know if this is really not so I think i retweeted it I'm like what is this somebody tell me what this is yeah and then someone bro a thing about is you know this deep fake what did it say was the article like the beginning to the end of democracy or something like that but it's uh it's really what do you want me to send it to you I found it I'm looking at I guess calling it a deep fake might be miss it's not misleading but yeah it's not technically a deep fake but it's not accurate either it's it's like manipulation he opened his tongue like that right yeah I think what this is saying he opened his tongue like a normal open that's a real picture every housewife in bel-air by the way yeah yeah the hanging on to articles on Vice where it says it's not not everything is a deep fake for the love of God not everything is there's not a great title for art or for an article this is a sloppy joe is trending do they think about taken down Oh didn't so Trump retweeted that did he reach shrub yesterday don't we where are we like what is life right now see what people want from him is for him to be like like his fans they want him to be this boss guy that doesn't make dumb mistakes I mean but like if you if you say something stupid that's one thing but if you say something stupid and then try to pretend you didn't say something's do but now you've doubled down are you talking about when he told everybody to booth bleach oh yeah well he said me what has a way to use disinfecting this it's clearly not he's not being sarcastic but then he said he was saying it's sarcastic just to report it's like he's so embattled with the report it's like I've never seen anything like it he's embattled with his ego his ego is the first thing he's embattled with in any time that's threatened he can't he focuses on that he's so focused on his his sensitive ego that everything else falls to the wayside like just running the country's like yeah I'm busy tweeting my haters right now I'm busy tweeting trolls for hours can you imagine him like what is he wearing when he's in bed and like sweat steam room but he keeps blowing out his iPhone so he got me a new one China and everything I think that guy I bet he could never imagine what it was gonna be like to have that job to be hated that way no I think he wasn't able to put himself in a category of ever being hated but that seems to be his biggest downfall and as big as insecurity is what people think of him but when you're living in conflict right so he's in this constant conflict with the press and the reporters when the when he gives those speeches when you're living in conflict like that you're always at like 7:00 they're always on edge you can't take things from a neutral place you take things you're they're always a bigger front and they really are the perspective is always off because you you look like stuck in conflict it's actually like happens to people's when you if you grow up in bad neighborhoods if you grow up in bad neighborhoods and they've even said that they've done studies Michael Irvin actually talked to me about this once a plane flight from Australia and explained to me that kids that grow up and they're born when when their mother is going through extreme stress like the mother lives in a very violent neighborhood and there's violence in the house and things like that the kid in the womb it changes the way the kid will approach life that's what I was saying to you before I was wondering it like a stressful like living in a stressful environment having an effect on the development of the child I'm sure well but I mean this is literally they're changing the wiring in the brain while she's pregnant with them right like it's happening because of the outside world it's like changing the baby changing the behavior make it apparently a much quicker ability to react or instinct to react like constant survival yeah on edge being on edge I think that's definitely also consistent with you know having a rough childhood or traumatic experience I definitely went through that experiencing things you know as a girl that made me reactive to men until I learned how to like narrow it down to this one instance and deal with it it's interesting like how you're able to overcome trauma with therapy and behavioral changes but I think it comes down to that like having traumatic things will always sort of negate I'm sorry we're always sort of dictate how you react to things sure trauma drives the ship for so long until you deal with it and have some sort of therapy and even then sometimes it's difficult to overcome your instinctual response which is based off of that sort of you know the experience of stress being influencing how you react you know what you were talking about earlier talking about what kind of an effect is this disease gonna have on people yeah well I'm hoping that it's gonna have an effect on shifting in a way we understand how how good we had it and how recent this is that people have had it good I think one of the reasons why we're so quick to react to things like why a child in the womb would be quick to react and more of more tend to be more violent or react quicker to violence or to be defensive because it needed it for survival until about four or five hundred years ago everything was a bloodbath fuck yeah I mean if you good so far I mean we have all of our needs are instantly met and then because of that our needs grow because we need more like oh this iPhone 11 isn't good enough I need an iPhone 24 time more things that complain about we find more things to be bitter about but less things to be thankful of like I think if anything I hope that when we come back from this other than the fact that I hope people get their lives in order because I hope that we get this understanding of how temporary all of this really is yeah and how we just thought because just it existed because it had always been here it always will be here this is fragile this is fragile like the Great Barrier Reef Sun Tan Lotion it's like fuck you we have you we haven't put enough effort into educating ourselves about the things we're consuming the products were buying and the people were surrounding ourselves with we sort of had this reckless abandon approach to existence and I agree with what you're saying I think hopefully I thought about this yesterday when I was high in a walk yesterday with my dogs where I hope and one thing that I've gotten from this is a humility about existence a humility about being a human and and all of the things that we get in just a society but also in everyday life our needs are have exceeded what we really need to exist in our in our wants are beyond what we really need on a day to day basis it's greedy it's so fucking greedy and it's not serving it's not serving the community it's a trick to you get tricked into working harder and wanting more and it's it's it's working hard for some dudes you don't know that that like cliche thing where you're making money job you hate to get in a car to drive to a house you can't afford to be in a marriage that you haven't put any effort into and to put the TV on to put the food that's not good for you in your belly and rinse I hunt the dogs are dead the dogs not the cunt usually it's a spouse the dogs the saving grace sometimes you can get a fucking rescue dog it's a little bit of a cunt yeah but you can change that with behavioral training the same thing as people you get rescue people yeah but you can talk to him dogs are like it takes too much time yeah it does take a lot of time to train them well but it is possible they're puppies it's easy it is easy when they're puppies you can start from the behavioral you know from the Ground Zero with their behavior but I know you're a big dog freak though you must have had like one or two dogs Eva Dopp do you like oh Jesus what kind of project did I take on yeah it definitely has been I have one my pitbull my pit Boxer mix he's been a journey I've had him for like nine years and when I got him I got him in Brooklyn in the shelter and it was like a bully breed shelter you know pits and Dobermans and German Shepherds and all the dogs that people are kind of scared of and it was like three rows of cages that wrapped around this room and they were all stacked on top of each other and I just put my hand up against each cage just to see how the dog would react in this stressful talking about being inside of a baby being a womb while the mother stressful this is a similar scenario where these dogs are in this room and it's stressful in there all barking so I just put my hand outside each one just to see their reactions and carlin was the only one who when I put my hand in front of his cage he didn't meet me with aggression he turned around and showed me his butt and he let me scratch it and like this is my dude right here but to that point the dog's behavior I'm sure you know this in a in a shelter is not reflective upon how his behavior will be of course or sure what the female dogs will be so it took years of training six years so much money here's a good question why is it so fucked up why do we feel so bad about that happening to dogs but we don't feel that same way about it happening to people I think I think people do but it's also about like your personal experience and in maybe some people don't feel like they have the the means or resources or the ability to start to help those other areas you know what I mean like maybe they don't know how to begin to help like we were talking about before causes that deal with child sex trafficking or they don't know how to start you know where do they start to help to help homeless people and things like that I think the dog situations an easier step to feeling like you're contributing a little bit I know for me like that whole thing changed because you know feeling like I wanted to help and give back more and finding purpose I think it's important in life to find purpose and maybe that's one of the things that you're talking about like after my dad passed away I felt like I wanted to have more purpose because it made me realize the value of life and what this is all about and it's not about what can I get its what can I give and so I did research into Alzheimer's and did research into how could I become an advocate and ways that I could inspire and help other people that are dealing with the disease and it's really a statement on turning pain into purpose and I think that people who get dogs maybe they don't have a big enough purpose yet does that answer the question well did I go too deep maybe you just like dogs I love dogs yeah it doesn't have to be so crazy well you know really I know you like to go into the darkness yeah yeah no there's dogs are like little love dispensers they're great they're pure love yeah they're they only function on love an immediate you know gratitude they just want to lick your face I mean my dog crapped in my carpet last night but that's okay I'm not taking it personally the problem with dogs I mean the pound dogs at least is that sometimes you know they're in for too long or they're just obituaries just they're scared they went there because they were abused it takes a lot of effort but isn't it crazy that we don't think the same way about people it is it's fucked up people that are in prison for stealing something we're like fuck I'm keeping the cage like there's something about like how many people really should be in prison how many people really I mean what really should be in prison a fraction of what we have yeah there's people in there that don't deserve and it's definitely a systemic issue for sure and it's a it's a it's a almost like a caste issue when it comes to like how much money you have it's definitely like a financial issue - right you know probably how about nonviolent drug offenders right think about that nonviolent drug offenders what do they do they take them lock them in a cage but if you're an opiate distributor if you're if you're a rapist built no no I'm saying if you're like a pool company like oxycontin you know what you do you just get money yeah you just get money you you you kill how many million people die every year from oxycontin's I mean it's it's it what is the worldwide opiate death 100,000 undred thousand in this country I don't think it's quite a hundred thousand seventy-five thousand it's a fraction of cigarettes which is really crazy it's a fraction so there's so so bad they're the worst but I get what you're saying it's definitely you know it's you know you're pumping pharmaceuticals and that's okay but people who are in jail because of marijuana yeah it's fucking ridiculous it's just possession in some states just yeah just having it on you having a couple ounces CDC's response to the opioid overdose epidemic in 2017 more than 70,000 people died from drug overdoses making it a leading cause of injury-related death the United States a lot of those deaths almost 68 percent involved a prescription or illicit opioid and a lot of these people who get on to opioids they never did drugs before that's not a word I say with confidence opioid opioid it's a tough one it's what I'm saying I'm I go saying that right oh boy it's a weird word it's fucking up the rest of my words cuz it was like opiates I could say that opioid and illicit opioid together is it tough there's so many people dying to that stuff and so yeah those are illegal that's legally prescribed we're talking about a quote/unquote legal drug that is on the market yeah and they try to give it to you - I had my nose fixed I had a deviated septum and they put this thing in my nose and cut out all the scar tissue it was really bad like I was listening to myself talk from like thirty twenty twenty something years ago and I I was like god I'm so nasally and I realized that's what it was like my nose didn't work it was useless I had like one quarter of one nostril that I could get air out of the rest was all smashed up so they fixed it but it really didn't hurt and I'm not trying to be a tough guy really didn't hurt it just didn't hurt like after is over I was like yeah my nose is a little numb but I'm not like ah I'm in pain it's like it certainly hurts but it's not like I need a drug and the guy offered me two different kinds of pills he offered me like vicodin and and percocets are one of those fucking things one of them was hardcore whichever one it was I was like Jesus man don't think it I mean they used to get you know perks for prescribing and they would get perks for how much they prescribed out it must be it must be is that whole pain management system that was implemented into our hospitals is also based off of you know from being able to prescribe opioids yeah in in companies were giving kickbacks to hospitals based off of their level of pain like if you had higher pain you would get money because that would equal dollars on the pharmaceutical side of you prescribing the drug really yeah I mean I read an article as long as you got a citation allegedly but I didn't read that God is crazy the doctor didn't mean he was like trying to he was wasn't just encouraging me he was pushing these things he's like you're gonna need this and I was like man everybody told me like oh my god it's the worst things ever and apparently used to be that they would pack your nose up with gauze and then when they pulled the gauze out at the end of like a week or so it was like really painful but now they don't even do that they have like these nose tampons and they just slide right into place and they come out after a week or whatever the fuck it was where I had to keep it in my nose to keep everything open after the surgery but it was nothing and this guy was like you need pills you need so I'm like I'm telling you was nothing like it was over it was like it doesn't feel good but it's not it doesn't hurt was he trying to Michael Jackson you was this was this I think they do that with everybody they just come they don't want to hear you bullshit no pain it gets you in line you whine either it's a driver my knee is killing me what to do take those pills I gave you stupid I feel like a lot of the medic let me rephrase that there are some medical professionals because I I do think that it's an amazing profession like you said earlier how lucky we are to have these people who want to help people as a profession yes but there are doctors who are lazy and there are doctors who aren't furthering their education it's like they go to college and then they become a doctor and they get that stamp and that label and then that's it they don't continue to read and evolve because information is evolving every day I mean look at this kovat crisis something new is coming about every single day yeah and it was really apparent when my mother she was sick she had an issue with her heart and she went into the doctor and then immediately the doctor wants to put her on a bunch of medication not one for the doctor asked her about her exercise not once the doctor asked about how she eats and what her history was with nutrition didn't even offer like a an alternate way for her to eat to sort of build her heart strength from within just wants to put her right on medication and to me that's a big issue with our medical professionals these days they're just lazy well there's maybe a little bit of that but also it's like that you can do you can get a person on medication but trying to get a person to get their shit together it's fucking way too hard it is way too hard especially if someone's coming to you with like health issues you can look at them and go hey man you gotta get your shit together you're gonna fucking die stop eating Twinkies stop your can soda all day come on I would rather that but you can't do that they know they're not gonna look first of all they probably won't listen they'll get mad at you they'll say you're fat fat shaming them you you can't tell someone that they have to get their shit together and then boom they get their shit together it's like a long process and yeah they have to be fully on board I agree with that I just think it goes further to the doctors being not having the care or whatever it is to to at least provide a little bit of information I think to be a doctor to give like a really good holistic approach like a holistic response like let's take care of your whole body let's not think about this injury let's think about your whole body why did this injury happen why do you get sick why you know what's going on and what can we strengthen let's take a look at your nutrition let's take a look at your lifestyle let's take a look at the amount of sleep you get but I don't know it's time for that's the problem doctor like that is really fucking time-consuming and these doctors are fucking pumping people in and out of their office they're dealing with insurance and malpractice lawsuits and it's a business too crazy business and they're still in hock for the fucking student loans they got together they stopped to pay those student loans it's so fucked up shout out to my friend Steve Graham he was on he was fuckin struggling with his student loans until he was like well into his adulthood he's an ophthalmologist and for him a catastrophic amount of money that you have to spend to go to school so it's that's so unfortunate it's great you you send them out of the gate with an incentive to do more surgery because they're all broke and they're on debt they're in debt in a big way hundreds of thousands of dollars imagine you got to catch up to hundreds of thousands of dollars it's so stressful and then be able to operate or prescribe or to be present to be in the front lines today but I mean a lot of that is the breakdown in the overall system the overall you know health care system is completely it's it's so disjointed from really keeping people healthy I know because it's a business and maybe it's my hippy heart but isn't there some way we could shake the shit up so that at least it's starting to give people information knowledge and tools so they can have somewhat of a healthier existence the problem is people are a lot like dogs in some ways you know it's very difficult to learn the bad lessons you learn when you were young you know if you like you get a dog from the pound and their life was fucked up and they're all sketchy that's the same thing with human beings it's also the same thing with diet like people get on a certain diet when they're really young their parents are on this shitty diet it's fucking hard for you to get them off of that it's ingrained it's a part of their genetics all animals whether it's humans or dogs or anything they seem to get trained by their environment and then once they're trained once they've sort of adapted to their environment and in whatever way they had to it's really hard to get them to shift it's really hard to get them to change its at reinforcements like behavior and reinforcement like you have to almost take it upon yourself to wreck why you're doing something and what is it that's reinforcing you to do it and that takes a lot of self awareness and self work to go oh I'm doing this you know you know for for a lot of girls that I know I mean because I'm a huge female fanbase when I do dr. Peluso on Mondays thanks to you I'm a doctor I ask I answer questions for everybody and sometimes their medical and I'll Google and try and give a little bit of information but a lot of times it's girls like this guy is such a jerk and you know should I text him back and you're allowing the assholes into your life to satisfy that void and inside of you you know you're sort of allowing that behavior because that the the negative effect that you have is like that reinforcement and just brings you back into that cycle of trauma and abuse that you experienced before dude I feel like I can get deep here with you Joe and you won't judge me no I don't judge you it's a father of daughters that's why I say like do you feel you know a certain way about raising daughters in this climate because that's my experience and I know what it's like I'm a very hopeful person and my hope oh not just for my daughters not just for everyone in this room but for everybody is that all this stuff is a wake-up call for us and I think that what we were talking about these deeply ingrained patterns of behavior that people get into and that we need to you know especially especially with healthcare but also also with education and all the things that you you need to to keep your body healthy and to allow you to advance in life to give you a chance in life to be in a place that's crime free to have nutrition and to have health care and to have education and if we could give that to everybody look I've always said like if we really wanted to make this the best country ever what would be the first thing you would do it said well we need to have less losers we need to have I mean losers like you know they're weak or they're I mean like they got dealt the wrong hand you got born into a terrible neighborhood that's crime-infested and it's been this way for decades and no one's gonna change it and there's just gangs and drugs you can't say that someone who's born in that neighborhood has the same starting line as someone who's born in bel-air it's crazy to say one person right so we got to figure out how to have more people have more of a chance and instead of thinking that it's all for us you know like the people that that do well like whether it's through Wall Street or business instead of steadily continually chasing more and more money maybe something like this will make us say like we gotta reinvest in bringing everybody up and then there'll be more competition which would be better for everybody because you have more people that are striving to get better and people pushy do they push you people that are good push you and you become better because of them like it's iron sharpens iron it's in the Bible you need it you keep moving and then we could somehow another make things at least slightly more even because right where it's not you can't fix it it's a huge disparity but it's it's not like these crime-ridden stir this is just what it is no there's no solution we've put all the mathematicians and all the social engineers and we can't fix it the education aspect is a huge huge issue like the the access to education access to safe yeah and the state yeah yeah right and then healthy food and then understanding the choices like why why you want to eat healthy food and what's the difference and show and educate people just educate people on that how many people grow up and they don't even know that drinking all that sugar eating all that sugar is gonna fuck you up long-term what goes back to what you were saying about the parental influence you know it's just you it's ingrained and who you are yeah you know it becomes that that sort of vicious cycle of rinse and repeat you know how you how you eat how you live it's it's it's definitely an issue but there is something to say about people who experience severe trauma and they live in bad neighborhoods where they go the complete opposite route you know sure both of us I mean look at comedians yes I mean that's born out of a seed of trauma and you know there's a lot of amazing business men and women who achieved what they achieved because of the disparity they experienced in their childhood so there is something to the the dichotomy of the journey from experiencing the trauma to achieving success but do agree everyone needs to be lifted up so that we so that the whole community can experience the benefit of that it's the thing about this Cova that makes me scared on a level like in a little bit of a level is desperate people do really bad things yes because they need things for their family to survive and I'm not saying that's where we're at right now it could have gone that route but imagine having people with access to safety and education and food everyone would chill the fuck out a bit right because he wouldn't be worried about survival no but still you know this is a there's so many things that are fucked up about this right that we've never had this happen in our lifetimes hasn't happened in a hundred years there's so many things that are fucked up about this but the repercussions we gotta be real careful about how we manage the repercussions of starting everything back up the economy starting it what do you think is gonna be what do you think one of the first issues is with opening things back up that we're gonna experience drunks comedy shows like that kind of shit yeah where people gather movie theaters are probably fucked right are you saying about the reinfection in the read I think they're gonna be scared too people are gonna be scared to go there they're not gonna want anybody sitting like right next to each other in the movie theater like it used to be so they're probably like multiple seats that are open so the movie theaters won't make nearly as much money probably cut there I mean who knows probably maybe even more than in half yeah alright and there's gonna be a lot of people that are scared to go the movies and now they also set a precedent we can watch movies on Apple TV it's not the same I miss going to movies and I know that's such a like self-serving desire and want and it's not necessary but I fucking miss it I miss going to the movies never happens at home no one ever talks at home there's not two people in front of you having a conversation what do you think he's gonna do with that I yell at those people those fucking I'm an asshole but that's the problem with going to the movies like you can't like if you go to look if you get lucky go lose a hundred cool people in there you have a great time I've seen some movies with cool people like you know I think the makes me really dictates that as well if you're in a movie where everybody's laughing like if it's if it's a killer movie it's a really funny movie experience yeah yeah it's yeah feel the energy but when motherfuckers talk you know that really doesn't happen when it's like nerdy movies you know like film house you know if you go see like peanut butter Falcon nobody's fuckin talking you didn't see peanut butter Falcon was Shia LeBouf is that how you say his name if it's not we're gonna say it that way from something that guys doing in France I'm sorry they both peanut butter Falcon was this great movie about this this special needs kid and his friend that he picks up along the way in the journey that they make together like a total you know feel-good movie but it features this really talented special needs actor that it just it's a heartwarming film and Shia is he's a great actor did you ever see that thing where he when Trump was elected he was getting people to chant he will not divide us he will not divide us yeah there's something about that where where was he well this is this is why it became fight was it reddit or 4chan fortune right that did it fortune so this is website of mischievious people called 4chan and they found out that he had set up on his website he had a webcam on this flag that said he will not divide us and he had this firing in the middle of Oklahoma somewhere on a web cam streaming on his web site so the the geniuses these nerd geniuses decided to triangulate where that was based on the stars that you could see on the webcam in the distance they figured out where it was on planet earth then they had someone drive around at a truck and honk the horn while another person was listening to the webcam and see if it gets louder or quieter so as they got closer and closer they've seen you shit they finally got to the webcam they took the flag down the guy looks in front of the camera goes fuck Shia LeBouf that was a fucking rollercoaster of genius its genius it was a genius thing but here's the thing radio lab had a whole podcast about it it was really interesting because first of all no one he got all right this is not about violence this is not about terrorism it's not no one got hurt a point of view but it's also funny it's also funny and if you don't think that's funny well then you must not have had a job that you hated where you sit in a cubicle and you google funny shit because that's funny it's really funny and look shy it's gonna get over it if that's all the guy did say fuck Shia LeBouf that shit's hilarious if that was me and I was a pretentious fuck and then decided that said he will not divide us website no but if I did and they found my flag and they took it down they went fuck Joe Rogan that's brilliant like talented and the fact that they found it by the stars but here's the thing fortune they got they said well it was on this website 4chan that's been known to be sexist and misogynistic and all the other istic sand isms you know and because someone might have posted like a Hitler frog with the Frog what's that children's book you know that Pepe the Frog oh yeah yeah yes like because on that same message board somebody might have posted a picture that other thousands and thousands of users they'll use something like that to just to say oh this is just what 4chan is it straight to groups it's just the worst people on earth the biggest monsters ever yeah and people that found that fucking flag by staring at the stars okay there that - I don't think that's amazing you think that's amazing it only didn't say fuck Shiloh boo that's it that's some really talent that that's like talent that should be focused in a specific field listen it probably is they're probably just bored they're probably tired this fucking shit and they just they saw it and they're like this guy I'm going to find it I'm gonna find that flag and then they put their nerd minds to the test you know good it wants to felt to find this fucking flag that's like a like a movie like you like find an ex and dig a hole and find Pirate's Booty yeah it's like a treasure hunt so you can't omit treasure hunt treasure hunt and it's so Radiolab took the podcast down and i love radio labs one of my absolute favorite podcast why did I take it down because people were complaining that they're supporting 4chan by threatening this pocket that podcast but that's a that's a that feels like a threat of it freedom of speech well if people don't like something we're gonna start taking it down like no keep it up because only those conversations are the ones that move the needle on a societal level like only those conversations where people are debating do we learn and grow if we open ourselves up to that I mean if you and I sat here and agreed on everything it'd be a fun conversation but it's also interesting to have you know alternate points of view and learn from one another it's also they didn't do anything that deserves to have them nuked from the historical record yeah exactly if you have people and you have an open message board which is what it is and people post awful shit that's just that doesn't even really represent who they are most of time when people are posting they're posting because they're bored or they want a reaction it's like it's a terrible way to communicate with people it is and it's also find a way to create some sort of algorithm to block people like that instead of taking down the the people who are who are putting up these videos instead of censoring you should just block the trolls block the trolls and they can go someplace else but people in crying they do that themselves because they want to get a reaction out of people they do it's I guarantee like when you see people that post that Pepe the Frog with like a Hitler hat on they're doing this they're doing it to freak people out no we're doing it that like because that's their ideology that they're actually a Nazi the way more of them are doing it to fuck with you and they're trying to do it anonymously yes it's just a weird way to communicate I experienced that early on during this whole quarantine thing right was doing a zoom a podcast by a zoom did you get zoomed homie whoa I've been hearing about these what happened so I went to record my podcast sharp-tongued podcast shout-out to my own podcast on zoom and I didn't set the parameters I didn't know that you there's like settings to it to make it kind of closed so you can make it close didn't I sent the link now could make oh I sent the link out and everybody who had the link could access and post and show their video oh no and I didn't know this cuz this is like the first week of you know everyone figuring out zoom and so it's it went dark web quick there was definitely someone fucking a woman screaming in the background people screaming the n-word at me saying Jesse likes da F likes to fuck n words and all this craziness and screaming and like no it was like so early on I didn't have access to like my normal producer girl and so I just like oh I can do this myself I'm gonna like learn and do it myself and I learned the hard way to not dip out into the web people left at their own like their own expression if they know they're not being watched or if they're know if they know that they're not displaying who they really are they're fuckin dark they can be but I'm I think even that they're trying to get a reaction exactly it's they were trying to get a reaction it's just a dumb way to communicate openly with strangers they got one cuz I was like oh oh wow what is going on in here you can't have that you can't have like I had to shut that down but it was it was a quick little glimpse into how people will try and get a reaction out of you yeah they're bored people are so on edge right now they're bored out of their fucking mind for weeks boredom is fine I'm not afraid of boredom people are going so bored fucking learn a language pick up a pick up a guitar boredom is is a time for you to put your brain to use or to give your brain a break you know people really go on board really go off for a walk can we not do that can we not go outside in nature I think people need interests exactly find something you're interested in whether it's documentaries on shit or find something you want to try to learn how to do find a purpose there's a lot of things you can learn to do lines I mean there's no excuse now I mean Yale even offered that like a course in the what is it like well being like something like the Oh who's gonna teach that course I mean probably some lady who has a lot of cats but it was a free course from Yale is the point like early on there like here - you could learn all sorts of things in this I think boredom is an excuse for laziness Yale should have a course on stuff like that like self-help people and hypnotists you know what do you think about hypnotist like do you think it's real have you ever been hypnotized yeah so can you tell me what it's like well my friend Vinnie Sherman he's a he does what I do for the UFC he does that for a lot of Muay Thai events great guy he's a commentator and he's also a hypnotist and a mental coach he works with a lot of fighters and I said I want to know what it's like he said okay I'll hypnotize you and I'm like all right here we go so he sits me down he counts me through this thing and next thing you know you're in this weird state I don't know how long it took to get me hypnotized a couple minutes or so but you know I gave into it like I'm trying to just I was trying to listen just listen to him he's a friend I really liked him so it was easy to trust him and just say all right let's see what this is all about and I feel like it puts you in a place where it cuts down you're still conscious you're not like at least I was it's not like you're you know you don't know what's going on you wake up with your pants down it's not like that hello College whenever you text jessiemae will send me a text but it's there right fuck it's fu XT and I said why don't you ever use the C and she goes it's to open it reminds me of college I was like I'm going to Japan oh my god that's so exciting when I was like just kidding I'm high in sushi so why hey I was reading this thing about Japan about their Cova deaths are really low right now because you talked about it and totally diverted all the hippies just saying yeah so oh y'all keep doing it I keep talking about it but it was interesting it's like just I wanted to I wanted to be sounds crazy but my thing would be to try to figure out how to distract myself less have less procrastinate and you're a procrastinator know very little but I want to get rid of it even a little I got laughs it just seems like maybe it worked before I moved into this studio but it was just an interesting way of channeling out all the bullshit and getting to like sort of the heart of who you are in this weird way it's like it gets to this weird Center of you and then as expands back out to regular consciousness it's like you're filled in with the outside world and a lot of shit remind me a lot of experiences that you can get or states of mind you can get what you do the float tank I was gonna say ketamine but yeah I've never done that but I know a lot of people are into that now I don't know what the fuck's going on I know so many people are doing ketamine I'm like settle down that kills people you fucks well I mean if you get you know the right guy the right person to do it you could survive ketamine parties come on over guys we're having quarantine and I mean parties in my apartment there's a thing about the flow tank you get to the state where you can kind of see things more clearly you feel like you're one with everything is strange it's very weird right very healing though mm-hmm so it sounds like hypnotism partnered with the right person could be a way to get into your mind and sort of do some therapy yeah for sure yeah because that's what float tank was for me as well I think it's real similar because he it leaves you alone other than the fact that when you do hypnotism you you'll be suggested you'll have be having a conversation with the therapist the person who's doing it to you I'm only basing it on my one experience I've seen some other hypnotism stuff online but I've only had it done once but I think that as people learn how to float and learn how to relax you can kind of use your inner voice and you can guide yourself through various aspects of things that you find troubling things that are bothering you things patterns bad patterns you keep recreating these anxieties yeah and perspective and I think that there's a real value to being alone with your thoughts and there's no better place to be alone with your thoughts in a flow time yeah sensory deprivation I think it's just it's a sense it's a in a way it's like a self hypnotism there's there's something to it that's interesting that's an interesting approach I think we'll be right it's almost like you're in you're in a womb in the womb again and yeah you're you're free of all the bullshit it really helps you just let the fuck go mm-hmm let go of your ego of your worry and all of that do you float a lot oh shit Hank right here yeah that's right it's the beautiful thing about it is that it it gets you away from all the other information like you're always getting information there's always something coming at you and most of its subliminal you don't even realize the effect it's having on your brain or and/or and in all of those synapses that are firing and at some point they need to relieve themselves and when you're sleeping I'm sure it affects your ability to go into those deep REM cycles you should get like three or four a night maybe you don't get as many because all day long were inundated with these phones and these screens and the sounds and especially us were in the city there's value to removing yourself from a highly populated area that's the one thing I realized about this quarantine is the appeal of the rural life yeah you know I was talking with Justin our friends from a BX and he was showing me a video of his home and it's just all this beautiful grass just green don't tell anybody where he lives I won't was just beautiful if you guys I'll send you the video you guys can geotag it by the blades of grass you fucking nerds - article jessiemae supports 4chan protesting for 4chan yeah i just think there's a value to like surrounding yourself in nature and for you you know I'm sure you've provided yourself in existence that represents your values in life but do you feel like the way you live right now in your house and your home feels like a real homestead to you or does it still feel out of place because you wish you were someplace else well when things like this happen one thing you realize there's two things you realize one that there's it's really nice to have a nice community I have a bunch of nice neighbors I love that I wave to them I love that like we talked to each other I love that it's not only sweet it means a lot to you when shit gets weird you know when you have a bunch of nice people that live near you but - makes me realize the value being able to grow your own food like if you lived on a fucking farm and some shit went down you wouldn't have to go anywhere you could you've got animals and vegetables and you're managing everything and you know if you have live on a small organic farm that's like the move is the move is you have a small organic farm and then you have a few friends that live on this property with a small organic farm and you split time and you share the value of the resources of the stuff that you grow yourself you could get away from having supermarkets if you did that you really could you know who lives like that the actor who played Shazam Zachary Levi I like that guy a great guest on here he speaks a lot about mental health and he has a really yeah he's great on the marvelous mrs. Mazal oh he was wonderful he was such a great supporting character to her yeah but in Suzanne was amazed over fun where she lives like that he's got like a communes sex which sounds oh how they do it it always starts like God we're just gonna grow tomatoes together you know he's gotta fuck your wife you have to give them ten percent it's literally wanderlust ooh that movie wanderlust has anybody ever done a cult write anybody well what's doing a cult right how would you what would the Joe Rogan cult look like Campbell's the problem is in you die and someone else takes over and they fuck it up that's what happens with every good empire if you figure it out the first time if you get it right would you oppose you have people drink the punch no too much work so much work but I'm amazing that no one liked the last one to come up with a good one was like Scientology right that's the last one that's stuck 20th science fiction author by the way yes really bad science fiction author really bad but it talks a lot and says a lot to the power of persuasion you read his stuff no III need to read a stock okay like Harry Potter it's all first draft there's never a second draft it's the most nonsense and narcissistic but it's bonkers like it's the stuff it's bonkers like some of the some of the reading like he would break these stories and you'd get paid like you know like a penny a word or some shit like that and he would write like a bunch of them for like strange times magazine stuff like way back in the day like this is what he did before he created Scientology he wrote these stories and you know like what was the one that John Travolta movie that they may have a filter that's damn Jaime he's a wizard you got that mushroom coffee going he's a wiz Jesus are you an Asian I see that did you ever see Battlefield Earth it's all with the eyebrows using when Epson homers didn't write back and it was John Travolta's like lifelong dream to turn that movie into one of the most preposterous movies of all time we turned that book he turned that book into a masterpiece he looks like every white guy who wishes he was black look at look at the dreads look look at their they're supposed to be giant and the humans are these little tiny people is that Forrest Whitaker oh my god yeah so anyway this movie is it's like showgirls you ever watched showgirls for fun a great movie for fun so bad you're like what in the fuck it's like there's a lot of movies like that that are great because they're awful I need to rewatch this yeah he looks like a dude who hacky sacks in a park during the day please do this for me and for your fans for me and for your fans spark up and do a fight companion for Battlefield Earth you earth for the first time and cue it up so that people can watch along they'll just see you but they could like to watch Battlefield Earth on one screen and you on the other if they queue it up at the same time they'll get you reacting to the movie that's such a good I'm gonna do that for the next podcast that's a great idea I think you might have to have headphones on because you probably couldn't have the content of it streaming right my mind has blown that he rewrote this oh you got to read some of the stuff he wrote you read some of the stuff you wrote you it's just terrible it's it so is this like is this it's bad it looks really good your mind feels like it's so bad it's just like what is what the fuck you doing the fuck are you doing but people like that and I've said this about Hitler and people who are just people who have these massive capabilities of persuading just a massive people like like l ron hubbard l ron hubbard it's like a missed opportunity to do something good well there's an have you ever read that book lauren was Lawrence Wright's book is that what is clear is it is it Lawrence right is that who wrote it I think it is the book on Scientology is amazing I mean fucking amazing and they did a was it an HBO series he did on it they did some anyway it just it's a book about like it's books about it's about how he created it how l ron Hubbard created the I was given director in screenplay okay that's that was a lawrence there was a book written - yeah there was a book written - going clear maybe it's going clear that this is called that's called going clear I wonder like you know in marketing how there's like a tipping point to like where things become like the same thing so go and clear Lawrence Wright - okay so I think the other one is the Alex Gibney directed the long is that what it is they're both must be anyway the the story behind it is he was self helping himself so he was psychologically kind of fucked up and he was sort of self diagnosing and self medicating City give himself therapy by taking a lot of these principles of different self-help books and different psychology books that he had read and then he started applying that and they started putting that together with some like fuckin UFOs you have fuckin like Tony Robbins on crack but when I forget what the directors name and they're going clear on HBO it is you know it's fucking amazing and one of them there's this guy who's a big-time Hollywood guy who was in Scientology I forget what he's a director right with Agatha yes that guy and Paul like he's a really really respected Hollywood guy right makes movies and he's deep into this thing right probably given to millions of dollars to somebody and then finally he gets to read these handwritten notes that he's been waiting for like this is the you're on to the next level and he's like is this am I being trolled but he thinks it's like almost like a test next level like it's Super Mario Brothers exactly like Super Mario Brothers but that's kind of smart that's smart marketing well a sense of achievement like you've achieved something different and that's like what I was saying like do you think how in marketing there's like a tipping point to when things become viral and more popular do you think there's like a tipping point to Scientology just the floodgates opened and then everybody was sort of well here's it the following if you follow a lot of the tenets of things like Dianetics all these self helped him if you follow the good stuff you can actually do better and you'll do better because you're also focusing on the fact that you're following this path that's gonna do better so your intention your focus and your during your day is of improving and doing better and applying all of that so a lot of people that whether they join this or whether they take something less benign like Tony Robbins stuff which is very motivational but without the cult mostly I mean he's not your guru he's he seems really good for a guy that's experienced what he's experienced but to be that doing that kind of stuff for this long I'm actually reading a wake awake the beast within read unlimited power like in 1989 or something shit was great there's a lot of great stuff in it but those people that if you're if you're one of those people that's doing something like that like the Giant at the beast giant yeah who's the other example that I used the the other motivational dude with Jamie help how did we both forget I said Tony Robbins and who else anyway point is there's people want something that guides them in a positive direction if they think it's gonna be Tony Robbins or if they think it's gonna be Scientology they're trying to do better right so if you say well Scientology really helped my life it did but why did it help your life it helped your life because you decided to focus on doing better in your life and you use the tenets of Scientology which some of them are really good yeah I read Dianetics I read like a couple of chapters it's like religion there are aspects of it that you can apply to your life and it's benefit from it but then there's the couple who start rivals the tribal side that gets crazy with everything though look how focused Tom Cruise's he is very focused where is he having his ankle broken half doing mission impossible do you see that shit was that when he jumped on the wall dude he's like holes set a hundred and seventy two he's at least 56 he's 5000 years old he's from another gal 57 okay do you think you could take him seven years old 57 years old he jumps from one building all the way to the other who this fucking rope attached to him and Miss hits it and slams his ankle into the side of the building you see his foot compresses ankles fucks Ville why do they allow in the movie contractor they're like yeah we're gonna have Tom or do you think he Drew's was like fucking I'm gonna do it he's gonna do it and you could eat shit all day because he's fucking Tom Cruise yeah you can't handle the truth he's looking all that helicopter piloting for the mission movie - yeah what they said and showed but he's a legit maniac I love him or hate him that guy is a legit maniac a badass actor if you don't think he is watch interview with the vampire and shut the fuck up yeah that's a good one he was amazing also legend for the ladies who are listening from the 1980s ladies from the 80s the legend what Tom Cruise was in the legend you remember that movie are you your nerd that's right you'd watch that I remember that movie that was a dope it was really hang no yes no it is why did he look like Donald Trump son no this is him really hanging on right no no no I have chills yes oh god are you for real yes I have such a height a flick do you understand how hard that is to do no no Chris I wouldn't do it this crazy fucks hold it on a plane do you attribute that to Scientology yes only well only other way he could have done so also he's flying this helicopter for real so he's doing this crazy helicopter stunt for real by himself this fucking maniac no she drives race cars now is that a death isn't it remember when I said about playing pool you watch someone play pool in a movie talk shit he looked good money of sociopathy that's playing there why do you have to find negative why can't you just look at there's a question I didn't say a question they're making it happen Jesse may why on the dark side just look at these fucking crashes that he has riding his motorcycle you just kind of think out of all the people that have done all the action movies who is who's wild in this motherfucker he's the Michael Jordan of action movies whose wilder than this motherfucker look legitimately at Vin Diesel you have to be it is it's it's a lot it's the name that comes with a lot of attitude do you think Tom Cruise is like a is he a daredevil or is it I think he's does do you think he thinks he's an immortal because of Scientology hmm I think you think he gets his own planet when he dies or is that a Mormon that's a Mormon right Mormons get their own planet they do yeah yeah fuck dude there's a fucking album from Johnny Murray or the Osmond Brothers from the Osmond Brothers and in the inside the album when you open it up from back in the days a the album the name of the album is the name of this thing that happens when you get your own planet when you die and then there's always different people they all have their own planet okay we need to know that the plan okay that looks like is that it a cult which one is it I think it's the planet look at the pink people there's one that you open it up and then the inside of it it's got all the different so I remember I remember we did this before I just I know we did in fast joe rogan your treasure chest of information useless shit I told you my chimp brain is overused it's taxed the information just stumbling out of it out of nowhere makes for perfect podcast fodder though oh you reminded me member when I said every ill and it works well in macabre I wanted to tell you something speaking of chimps I was reading this thing about sperm competition in correlation with with sack size yeah the size of the balls and as I was reading that Joey Diaz video [Laughter] and so he calls me last night and he's like what are you doing beautiful Mike I'm just hanging out what are you doing is it calming and not with the missus in the kid and I was like what sounds nice and he goes did you check out those nuts [Laughter] it was like yes I did Joe they they're math they're not nuts they're fucking planetary systems it's a universe I've never seen nuts like that in my life what happened the violation didn't they get like a legitimate violation from that I hope so he just it looks like a Louis Vuitton bag he's so proud he's like a kid he's like a fucking four-year-old I love him so much look at he called me to be sure I'm a fucking live stream for the college too people don't realize how necessary of a person Joey Diaz is somebody who pushes the ticket like this who literally moves the needle with his nutsack he's such a he's a he's a national treasure he really is I love him so much but I just one of a kind but that's a great example like he experienced the fucking crazy it's the craziest life one of the craziest lives of anybody that's out of any of my friends and look what happens on the other end because of that you know and he's so gracious and he's so good to his friends and he's such a big heart you know on the other side of all of that it's just it's so weird how much of who you are is based on these sort random circumstances and how you come out of them yeah well I think you know a lot of it has to do with the absence and relationship to love and safety throughout your lifetime yeah in what your relationship to love is because like when you're born as a creature your job is to get love and then as you get a little older you learn how to love and then as an adult you learn how to give love and if that process is interrupted along the way it's going to affect how you express that outwardly to people in your life and for someone like Joey Diaz who as most people know experienced almost every kind of trauma and in crazy life experience you can have in a single lifetime for him to come out on the other side who he is it's a testament to I don't know a greater thing going on yeah a bigger he's also a bigger picture he consciously made a decision to be a different person yeah because I remember I heard you talking about how you'd bring him on the road and yeah and it wasn't always you know sometimes it was difficult he just had a real bad drug problem back then you know he's talked about it pretty openly he just liked to do coke and sometimes he showed up but sometimes he didn't and my take on it was I did want to not work with Joey like I love Joey did you love him immediately when you met him yeah yeah I don't think there was more than a couple weeks after Joey and I met that we were like best friends that's adorable he's not but I grew up around wild people he's a wild person chaos oh yeah I love it yeah but like people like him was like ah like when I was growing up I always felt I was felt out of place I didn't live with my real dad I live with my stepdad we you know we traveled around a lot so I was a lot of times I was the new kid and I I just didn't feel like I mate like I fit in with I looked at other people's lives with the mom and dad were together and the kids never got in trouble and everyone was doing well in school I looked at them like almost like they were aliens I go scared of them and I gravitated towards people that were like you know I haven't seen my dad since I was three my mom's been selling heroin and all right we're friends yeah I know like I and then through all my choices just sort of coincidentally whether it's through martial arts and then through comedy it's sort of reinforced that like it wasn't my my thought when I was 17 years old thinking I didn't fit in anywhere it wasn't my thought I know what I'll do I'll go seek out like stand-up comedians and fighters and they'll understand me yeah people sort of represent my own people are also fucked up yeah people who are also like like people who also came from a less just not a sub-optimal childhood to say it because I wouldn't have a bad childhood there's many people that had way worse childhoods and me wasn't bad but it wasn't good so it's like so going over it and trying to think how many people are living whaler worst childhoods way worse and then they have to correct as they're becoming an adult while they're working and they're in relationships to have self-awareness to know what it is and then fucking business with a million different things they're not even concentrating on themselves it says which is the thing you have to do is you think about - if you have to get good at anything right if you want to get good at playing basketball you got to concentrate on playing basketball to be focused that's Jamie he's actually a basketball wizard those lives got a nice Jimmy Jamie his three points are out of control but you have to concentrate on that how many times do people concentrate on being a better person concentrate on who you are concentrate on why you react to things the way you do or whether or not you're pursuing your passions with a hundred percent of your enthusiasm or whether or not you could be more successful if you got up earlier and got more done it just had a better attitude about things be just just more focused so it's hard it's hard the ego gets in the way of the self and it's those you know that self work the self respect in self care that you have to embark on but first shift self-awareness and to discover that requires a whole other a whole other situation and an ability to access your humility you got to be brave you have to be very very brave like that that's I mean not like brave like you're about to go stab a bear but brave ease yourself you're is a different kind of bravery it's like there's some bravery and this is the thing with men right the big thing with men is um men tend to be more inclined to place value on being brave in physical situations brave we save somebody brave realist risked your life brave where you did something that was a dangerous thing for the good of all or for the good of your loved ones but then the other kind of bravery the kind of emotional bravery will you look at yourself like accurately men towards they tend to shy away from that or to frown on that even I agree with that but it takes a kind of bravery to look at yourself accurately too it's a kind of bravery but it's still it's a daunting thing to sort of dissolve your pre-existing notions of who you are and look at yourself with fresh lenses have your daughters help you access that vulnerability about yourself or is it sure yeah anytime you're raising little people and you realize like how dangerous the world is for little people and then these little people you love them as much as any person you've ever loved times ten in your whole life it's impossible to describe every parent I'll tell you it doesn't even make sense when you see them you just get a like a love drug just floods through you it's different it's different and it's so it's so important and as a girl who was a daughter of her girl dad it's so important for you wait a minute you were what the daughter of the world have a dad who had a girl okay it makes me emotional but I had a really really great dad and dude do not cry I will fucking come over there right now but for you to love your daughters that love will carry them through all sorts of shit that they're gonna experience that you cannot avoid well you're not going to be able to be there and protect them the way you want to as a dad so like you're just loving them gives them all the strength they need for their entire life and I'm sure you know that but I just want to express it to you because I am that girl too like my father loved me so so much so it's such a responsibility because in order to express that love is a man you have to have a humility about yourself and you have to be real about your vulnerabilities so it's it's an achievement as a guy but also just as a man in the society to do what you're doing so you're you're creating healthy girls and we need more healthy girls in the world so thank you well you're welcome I'm doing my best I'm doing my best to be a good dad but I think we all need to realize and this is one of the things that I really realized when I started raising kids as time went on I recognize that I don't look at people the same way anymore look at them as babies that became people where I used to always look if I met you like oh here's Jessie Mae in 2020 and this is how she's always been that's just how I would think oh there's Jessie man hiya I know what you look like I see you all the time hey Jessie Mae but I didn't I would never think oh that was like a little two-year-old yeah this little two-year-old who was walking funny and dancing when music was coming on yeah ago and then life just sort of like puts you through the ringer and does this good and that bad and this better and that worse and then boom here you are in 2020 and it made me think of the whole path of human beings rather than just a static thing that you see in front of you right now that's like enlightenment that's a form of enlightenment that's you you know you're an evolved human to think that about people well it's not it's just seen it in real time like watching my kids grow up and watch them become these little intelligent things I can have conversations with little personalities forming and watching just when you have a little person and that all sudden that person's a big person or sitting across you having a conversation with them it's very surreal there's having full-on conversations with this person that didn't even exist yeah that you saw grow and get bigger how was the quarantine changed or evolved your relationship with them like is it brought up any few experiences with with my family and I think with all my friends it's made everybody a little more appreciative made everybody appreciative of each other yeah made everybody realize like hey this is this really can happen okay now that we know that everything really can shut down we've kind of all known this before it's sort of like what we're talking about earlier like we have this ability to block out all this stuff we're doing it doesn't affect us right now and I think something like this quarantine something like this pandemic makes you realize there holy shit or vulnerable they're really vulnerable and this is what's important what's important is staying alive and we were all on momentum we were all on momentum just running around but considering you know Buffalo drivers were the Native American creating them no Native Americans used to they call it's called a buffalo jump actually Native Americans used to chase these Buffalo off the side of a cliff and so the the buffer would be running and the ones in the front will go oh fuck there's a cliff and they go to turn around and there's a thousand Buffalo behind you running full clip you're going over the edge so they would all go over the edge and then the the Native Americans would come around the front and and pick up the Buffalo and take them well that's what we're like we're like we're on this crazy momentum we're just getting up and this working all day and doing this and all this momentum and you fucking upset and your blood pressure's up and then boom something like this happens and yeah it's terrible yeah I wouldn't wish it on anybody but there's an opportunity in this moment to reset your perspective and slow the fuck down get off the hamster wheel get off the hamster wheel and go why why am i living like this and what am i doing to contribute how I'm living how are my behaviors choices and decisions contributing to the life that I have in and I think I don't know about you but for me I've been really asking myself is the life I'm living the one that I want to live and how can I improve it is the travel thing the thing that bugs you the most yeah it's so exhausting and it's you know it's exhausting on a cellular level and it's it you know it's stressful it's it ages you it it really does it really does beat you up when you fly every week it beats you up when you fly every week and in it also I'm a big energy person and I like to conserve my energy and I don't like to give energy to people who are you know emotional vampires and I'm very specific about where I put it but traveling doesn't give a fuck about that it'll pull from that energy source as much as it wants to and you know like you I love comedy and I love to perform and give my all on stage and from tired from a flight sometimes those shows are great I don't know if you've had those ones we haven't slept at all and you go on stage and just like fuck it but for the most part I like to be rested and yeah you want to be rested you want to be where your brains firing yeah where you're not even thinking when you're in that like sweet zone to just it's almost like a natural reaction to the moment isn't it weird how dumb you can get sometimes like for me like I know me and everybody all of us we all have to admit that there's a range that we operate in we're on fire like we're brains fire in everything makes sense everything's going good get have a great conversation you understand what people are saying you're stimulated and where's my keys what's that guy's name we were saying what the fuck did I just say how do words work yeah sometimes my brain is like and sometimes it's like ah sometimes it's like a racecar and sometimes it's like a car with some shitty spark plugs it can barely make it out of the driveway have you found aspects of your life that contribute to you feeling like you're oh yeah what do you what do you attribute it to exhaustion it's a big one exhaustion is a big one I was doing podcast earlier in the day but I would do them straight from working out it's just too hard especially running Hills yeah you're out there with Marshall yeah or yoga yoga kick your ass too before a podcast I had to give myself an extra hour after the class before I try to do a podcast what's your routine after you work out hard like what do you do right after you work out I was replenish I always get finish yeah eat some food your body wants a protein and some if you're eating carbs your body wants some glucose and your body definitely wants some electrolyte so I always take electrolytes and you know I just are you a person who naps don't I can't imagine you napping like a napping bear I don't sleep at night I sleep good I sleep I'm a solid seven eight hours sleeper every night I need a nap what's the first thing you do in the morning give us what is regular morning routine are you the FBI yeah I've got people recording this I'm sure we can find out where you are I usually do some kind of workout either I'll do something with the dog will do the hills or I'll work out here kick the bag that kind of shit yeah lift weights depending on what day it is I just decide like today I'm gonna do this I just have a series of workouts too that I've been doing forever that I can sort of plug in a whiteboard or write shit down the whiteboard and you've been consistent through quarantine as well you've been taking it easy on exercising you've been doing that amping it up because I don't want to be I don't want to be edgy you know I want to be relaxed and you also don't want to be like the people from Wally what what's up with fat people Oh people just get lazy everything's done for there's no excuses if you're home all day there's no excuse to go to the gym for one hour and by the way you don't even need a gym yeah don't you need like a kettlebell you don't even need that you can do bodyweight shit there's a shit ton of things you could burn yourself out on just with body weights especially if you have a chin-up bar body weights you know dude I can do four do you have the one that go can you really yes that's very good is it yes it's very good I feel good I thought it was terrible I thought why is it with people who where's your mouth and so a shit you would never say like do you say bitch a lot but not in like a derogatory yeah I say bitch - is it the kind of hang over the door or is it one that's screwed and screwed into the wall good is that good yes better the ones that hang over the door freaked me out yeah in the bitches who don't look we have to like before you decide your Instagram Fitness Instructor let's read the instructions of how to put those bands in your door because there's so many people out there that are putting them on the door and slapping themselves in the back I'm noticing a lot of not all not all you ladies not all but a lot of these ladies that have the Fitness accounts also have like an only fans accounts oh yeah they're showing titties and clitty cats they're showing and you know what in today's economic climate it might be right behind I'll dress my butthole up for you we painted our dazzling nose I'll get it I'll get a really good artist to paint my butthole like a famous person and then you have to guess who it is that's a good idea yeah have you seen that one lady we've talked about it before on the podcast that makes that visual art the with painting paints eyeballs and shit on people's faces well remember that one particularly ever there's a lot of girls know the body paint stuff and do a bunch of crazy stuff probably 3d stuff yeah is that what you're looking at you're getting really artistic with a face and body paint that's interesting weird stuff so yeah you could you could do that to your but although yeah I think I might name thing I might do that I did make a butthole candle it smells like my butthole I bet you didn't I did how much you wanna bet wrong how much you wanna bet bet you're wrong I bet it doesn't smell like your butthole oh well we can't how would we even cash in on this test I'll blindfold off so I can't see anything just back it up oh okay we need to do a companion episode what do you think it smells like like an asshole smells like a field not a wallow smells like vanilla and leather Oh like leather what's her name grant Paltrow scandal yeah I was like everybody knows what vaginas smell like we need a BA okay did you come up with this idea after her this is like some next-level shit I came up with that idea I got really stoned really really stoned and I was like here's Gwyneth Paltrow pussy candle what other body parts could I meet all creeps the creepiest guys at your show just looking at you it's do do they do there's a lot of foot fucks out there I'm on Wikipedia somehow congratulations thank you it's I'm stating all my alkaloids Wikipedia yeah it's another area of a woman's life you have to be worried about but yeah my feet right comment like if you if there's even a toe and a fucking photo some dude comes out from the earth like some little slithering worm and he's like I see Joe doesn't my Annie Lederman so funny she blares pictures she has her feet in them and they're all pixelated yeah now she could have an only fans account where that bitch can retire if you're if you're a woman in this climate and you don't have anything to do retire on your butthole retire on your feet the world is like I mean depends on how much money they're giving you every month but you don't need like a lot of people to sustain you know and it's it's much smarter for a smaller price to attract you know a certain number of people I think the legitimate Fitness girls get mad at the naked Fitness girl absolutely I mean right well people there's always people worried about it diluting their own industry but these motherfuckers they they define the industry they also define the standards because if they're if there's gonna be a high standard there has to be a low standard don't you think with every industry I mean how it's a J becomes a different thing right this is because for one like the fitness thing for sure it's inspiring girls to want to look like her and like do this and ten lunges and this isn't that not for sure but also a bunch of guys who want to fuck her absolutely but when you dip into the world of here's my naked pictures for X amount a month then you're in a different realm because then the other girls that are just like the fitness girls who are just they're really expressly trying to motivate women to get fit and they're showing all these exercises and every day they're doing crunches and telling you to push it and keep going and don't quit one time I thought about quitting but I didn't Here I am but also here's my pussy I think oh gosh can you have a girl who's like a really motivating Fitness girls got like the abs and like the midriff showing wearing the yoga pants and look like a badass I think you can have it be honest about it and see your pussy you have to be she's got to be honest she's got to be like hey I am a I am a I'm here for Pilates and pussy that's you've got like don't here's the thing about drives me nuts those girls acting like they aren't also pussy girls you're also a pussy girl what does that mean a pussy girl you know what it means he knows what it means he's googling it he's out there he knows the girls but there's a girl shows her pussy's a pussy there's enough space for everybody it should be but a lot of bitches ain't well hatin bitches should focus their hate into something that can benefit them Cindy's over here just working on their lunges and try and put together a good program for you and Debbie's showing her whole asshole $5 whore she's ruining my sweat business with her butthole one butthole took my whole business down and he's all about those squats but there's there's enough people for both areas don't you think no you don't stand off a Mexican stand like a goddamn western movie of Clint Eastwood they should have to do they should have to actually do a physical test they should have to like to squat each other out whoever can do them whoever dies first is done well it's weird because they're in like a new category like oh let's stop it no new category like the female fitness influencer that didn't exist it never existed I just googled only fans and there's actually a story that's not heard about this this lady is a mechanic and apparently a very talented mechanic and the boys at work found out she also has an only fans account where she shows ly cooter and they fired her hypocrite so they were they were the guys were harassing her at work and talking about it could because she had created all this problem only if it might encourage her co-workers to approach you with an unwanted sexual conduct or comments so that's why they fired please give me a break you know the wives choice of all let's cut the shit she should be happy this is gonna make her way famous way more people are paying attention to her only fans account than ever would have forever before congratulations you hit the lottery you worked with creeps and you played it well and you got paid and they did me a favor by firing you also favor also my car is making a weird squeaky noise could she seriously hit me up girl I could use a little work under the hood if you know what I'm saying what were we just saying we were talking about only fans accounts just before that what hulls influences like right before like who was the first one I did it might have been fucking Jane Fonda oh she's the old John no shoot song it was way before the Jane Fonda didn't she do after movies she got into videos why do you think she looks that good she's like a hundred and seventy two she's not the no I know she's like 82 exaggerating I am exaggerating but you're right she she was like the first fitness influence she was due making videos back in like the 70s and 80s but if you can you name one other one from that era Suzanne Somers much he's the fat one though she just wanted that but that's her thing was about losing fat the losing fat one that was a thing stop the insanity Susan summer stop powder you're right Suzanne Somers ThighMaster Three's Company Susan powder was right the other one Suzanne powers want to the shaved head potato potatoes right wasn't that if you just eat potatoes you will lose weight it does work because you're so bored you don't need that much and so your body just naturally starts eating itself and you get thinner and weaker yes congratulations fucking terrible congratulations you tried to survive on potatoes yes Suzanne Somers another one right she did the ThighMaster videos and the dishes that that thing of squeezing your pussy together is that like the most sexually suggestive of all athletic devices like how many people are really concentrating on firming up the center of their thigh a lot of bitches come on there was like also the first only fans account she's out there just doing kegels yeah that's a cool it's like an outside Kegel yeah it's like you can you're tightening up all the muscles it's like are you working your neck muscles no I'm just doing traps you're working in there you got to do your kegels soon and especially in quarantine there's plenty of time to be doing a squeeze you got to squeeze that pussy make it tight look at her make it tight making right body good lord who was your like lady of the Horde of your like youth that you liked everyone liked like Farrah Fawcett liked her Suzanne Somers was hot she was like the rare combination of hot and funny what about like she was on Three's Company oh yeah she was you're right she was talented you ever watch the like the whole story of that it's like one of those behind the scenes stories like there's a contract dispute were they all Boni John Ritter no I think she wanted more money I think yes that's right yeah John Ritter was making the lion's share of the loop and she was like you know what we need to have favorite nations here there was one season where they she was like on vacation and she would like call into the show like she was never no I'm not kidding she was like on the phone like talking them like that was all she was in because the contract was the negotiation it was well there I think they were punishing her or because of the contract negotiations they didn't want her to be a major part of the show where she could hold the show up say look you got one scene and we could delete it if we want she's like fuck you you're strong my pussy is I will break out I think she I think she developed her strong pussy has a response to this she probably did do kegels guys can do kegels to pelvic floor exercise you can you can't dudes can do it too it's a good dude exercise so you don't you know I don't know if you guys have a pant pissing issue like women do when they get a little older oh Jesus women with kids they laugh too hard the pistol which is what I'm going for it my show because I want bitches the pistol pick I bet you've done it already yeah it should be an app where every time you pissed yourself at a comedy show you can click it I'd like to see which which person makes it's no longer laughter it's all about the piss factor I mean that's piss for certain it's not like an indicator for everybody but for some people it's an undeniable indicator yes like if someone in the middle of like we have a look you say you didn't laugh at the show that's interesting Tammy because it shows here when Jesse may hit that punchline you pissed your pants we read the song factor here and they're fucking haters there's some saturation in that little slice of cotton yeah you're you're already as soon as as soon as it's that's piss obviously piss what um what do you think's gonna happen all this are we gonna be back on the road no for a while yeah I think people are gonna be weirded out despite all these studies that have come out and people keep sending me more and more articles that are being written saying that this is not as dangerous as the flu but that's not really true because they're basing it on how much people died how many people died from the flu every year when we don't quarantine right so this is this is quarantine and the amount of people is equal to or greater than most seasonal flus and it's faster it's a little more aggressive it's very aggressive but it's also weird because some people get it in nothing so it's confusing because it's a new thing it is very confusing to new does it look we're very lucky it's not targeting babies and children we're very very lucky yeah you know we're very lucky yeah and it sucks it is targeting old people and it sucks is targeting obesity seems to be the number one thing they said in New York City there was a number one thing that the patients had the roughest time so that it had in common I mean obesity that's like one umber to killer it's like it's way up there I mean diabetes it's such a if you're obese you're susceptible to most of the diseases and issues that arise with I think that's also what scares people about opioids as opposed to cigarettes like cigarettes kill you but they kill you slow yeah it is a slow burn no pun intended they play it nice obesity yeah that's painful yeah it's an expensive many joints go it's it's it's brutal I mean it looks painful for people remember like the Maury Povich Show or they would have to like no fee when Ralph he was alive and was he I'm not trying to be disrespectful to him at all but his point of passing was he had his heaviest I don't think so I wonder if he had fluctuated throughout he fluctuated he even had some operations but talk about somebody stapled who obviously experienced a lot of you know a lot of pain a lot of pain yeah but the nicest guy very nice guy just a ball of joy five balls probably a bad term [Laughter] it's like you know it's not anyone's hope that your baby boy grows up to be morbidly obese it's not anybody's hope no and this is the difference between the way I look at people now as opposed to twenty years ago pre-k pre-k BK before just before kids the whole thing seems like a different enterprise to me the whole thing in terms of who you are and what what is life and so much of it is based on like if you wanted to look at it like this big old problem like what's causing the majority of the issues and this big problem this complex thing that you're trying to solve well the biggest issue seems to be the childhood think the biggest issue seems to be the love the experience in the house how you raise the lack thereof those are the motivating factors it's positive and negative like it's not a it's not a simple equations no it's not cuz like look we're just talking about joey wick everyone loves Joey we love Joey you don't make a Joey if everything's great no if you are there for your kids and the kid never does drugs never hold someone hostage with a machine gun and a coke deal gone bad all those things that you always done if everything goes great your kid never does those no you're not breastfeeding on time all the time with that kid Joey got through that he became this rare thing that everybody loves and it's precisely because of all that struggle so it's a real conundrum it is a conundrum because struggle can either define you in a beneficial way or it defines everything that's bad about you and all the negativity is just pot is just reinforced because you're still connected to that pain and trauma you're you're behaving ways to you know go back revert back to that time in your life where you were experiencing pain because it's a connection it's a connection that was the only love that you had oh sure and everybody has things in their life they have to process things that have been done to them things that they do and you need some sort of purging yes past absent who you are as a person and that way to put it one of the reasons why I like jiu-jitsu it's one of the reasons why I like anything that's really hard to do what do you think in your life has been the thing that you've associated the most pain with like what is something that you experience that has caused you the most pain or maybe you know trauma or something that you experience at the store that it's fucking painful to your core I'm still hurting from going on after Martin Lawrence and the nine what's he so funny oh dude when I first came to the comic strip by the way I sucked okay I was like 26 or 27 and Martin Lawrence was on top of the world he was wearing leather jumpsuits onstage and murdering and the place funny the place would be packed with people to see Martin Lawrence and he would destroy in the main would it feel like a rock show would it have that energy like eclectic energy it would be it was nerve-wracking first of all because I had been a Martin Lawrence fan like when I was an open mic er right so I had been a fan like from early on when I had first seen him on television and he's doing movies then I've seen his television specials and then I'm at the store and here I'm going on right after Martin Lawrence and not just once like MIT's he put me on after Mars it's like fucking every time I had a spot that's most of the audience would just get up and leave like Martin Lawrence is done the fuck it shows oh they want to follow it they they want to go after the rock star you don't you know you produce all that like electric energy in the room and then they want to go after that well they want that's when you're on stage they want to go homes what they want they've seen Martin Lawrence that's what they came to see but I've seen people do that to you at the store where you get off and they're like we gotta go talk to Joe we got to get some of that like they want to get you know get some of that energy from your clothes don't ya normal sized balls Joey's got something preposterous no Joey's are like gorillas you're probably no gorillas have little chips that's right no because they take care of the hair I'm they don't have any competition yeah there's no competition what so what's Joey's deal do you eat just growing I'm sure he had a lot of complications he's nuts or traumatic not so traumatized that's um my friend dr. Chris Ryan he talks about that all the time that competitive like if you look at the size of the testicles of chimpanzees you could there's a direct correlation between the size of their nuts and then how promiscuous the females are yes so the females are hoes they've all just keep their fucking everybody and I'm gonna fuck them better and they're just building up bigger and bigger loads it's wild like just that whole process like the load that a guy releases and all of that all of those sperm are competing every single one it's a whole army and they're all competing to get to the fucking remember when the orcs attached attacked the elves and Game of Thrones yes that's the loads do you think they're screaming for sure - screaming - do you think there's like the chariots of fires playing as well it's like an unintelligent noise that you expect like a demon to be screaming if it was coming over a hill chasing you demonic that's all come all come screams that's what I think screams hello special titles be that it's projecting it's coming flying out of you it's screaming in so much yeah I think what else comes shooting out of you like that it literally shoots out tears I mean it's like it's trying to get up in there yeah yeah of course they're screaming yeah you could hear him I wonder if it would change how often people fucker the way guys shoot like if you could hear the sperm screaming I wonder if they'd be that as many like I wonder if you plants money shot here you fuck your plants yeah around you and your fucking absolutely is if you think with music music helps what if what if we could find out that if you fuck while you listen to the Prince you get 75 percent more biomass but 75% less he was so little no it was so big I listen to Purple Rain while you're talking and you the trunks just keep getting thicker that's interesting though I wonder if music does persuade the the successfulness of the you know the pregnancy and someone getting pregnant that's a good question right maybe if having Mozart play for your growing baby makes them a little bit more able to be intelligent and make smarter choices maybe it can sort of help people get pregnant quicker when I was a kid I was one of the first generations of people that had a Walkman okay so when I was working out I was going to the gym back in like the fucking 80s alright when I was in high school and I was wrestling I have a cassette player I was like sit on my hip I had like this fucking neoprene belt or some shit I forget how it strapped in but this cassette player and headphone and I would go to the gym and there's you could listen to your own music at the gym this shit was unheard of you understand this unheard of and I remember doing leg presses - welcome to the jungle and I remember thinking how strong I felt because of this music your daughters are gonna be fine and so I got off the leg press and I was like that's crazy because like I literally felt like I had more energy like something happened I wanted to fucking go harder because of the music and I was like okay that is like it's doing something I know it's exciting me and that's making but what else is going on this is what stimulate musics the only thing that stimulates all areas of your brain simultaneously it's one of the only thing have you done Studies on this is this way that's why I've read off of your off of your Twitter feed music stimulates everything including nail growth and including your sperm all of it it's not it's kind of true look there's a book on audible so I I listen to this book you ready you're a doctor called music in the brain I honestly even think makes sense a person who is doing most of the talking as was someone that's been on the podcast I can't remember off the top my head who it was but they were talking about like when you're running so like if you're listening to music got a loud that takes an amount of brain power just to be processing that add that on top of the physical activity you're doing that takes brainpower to do plus endorphins plus all the chemical process there is something that happens there it has been studied I cannot regurgitate it obviously but I only know it but that would imply that it's actually it hinders performance because it requires resources resources to listen to music and then resources to run but not necessarily if it's engaging if the entire brain is being engaged I would think it would enhance the ability for you to exercise and maybe some of the maybe get out of your own way yeah yeah yeah and the only reason I know about it is because with research with Alzheimer's they say when the Alzheimer's patients reach a certain level or even just early on in their diagnosis that music can help alleviate some of the stresses and anxieties that are associated with a disease and because it activates the parts of the brain most of the parts of the brain that is thought to be a therapy for people who have Alzheimer's that makes sense yeah because it's doing something to juice up your brain like so almost like a sauna for your brain exactly like during the last two weeks of my dad's life he could not communicate couldn't eat his motor function functions and everything had just stopped we played Sinatra then motherfucker didn't talk for two weeks we played Sinatra he started to sing Wow in which song fly me to the moon ironically that's good yeah he started seeing and he also the last thing he laughed at was a fart so yeah let's fire up the black ash is that what it's Carl this is Darnell's I love personal Matt my man smells candles I love Darnell for Sanjay I mixed up two things I listened to not that same time though so there's a book called music in your brain which is by I believe his name is so I just had it Leviton this last name oh yeah even Levin thought I think I have that look yes and then I also listened to a separate thing which is by someone who has been here Steven novella your deceptive mind he has a he hasn't no oh I thought he has no I'm sorry deceptive mind there's so many guess it's hard yeah I mean there's we're at like 1500 Sean Carroll interviewed someone that did a podcast on the music in the brain and I think that's where I was confused okay I mean it's interesting Daniel's candle does not want us to look well it's the the key to candles is you have to burn them until you have to cut them first of all you need to cut the wick and then you have to let them burn until the whole area is melted so that it burns you equally all the way down mmm that looks like a disaster but this is a mess yeah it's a mess it's no surprise I mean somebody sent me one it's like Bernie Sanders as Jesus who's I'm gonna guess you got that from like oh did that come from Vermont to do surgery on this candle thing yeah you gotta gotta cut out some of that goo see this is but this is a guy that's industrial he's figuring out what to do industrious figure out what to do candles yeah that's you know he seems to be working that's why I made a bot whole candle congratulations on that but so did you are you openly admitting that you were inspired by going up outros of a jar oh yeah I was like where's the Baha candle girl how many of these but held candles have you sold weed we haven't even opened yet I don't think the shops gonna be open soon website what does it really smell like like how do you create about a whole smell it's sweet with a little bit of weather like swamp fog well yeah thank you Swamp fog which they won't be at Coachella this year they're opening fog but the girls just queef out a cloud yeah I just I do get inspired by Gweneth Gwyneth is Gweneth whatever her fucking name is sugar goop yeah oops candle oops hold so yeah did you try one of them jade eggs in your twat she wanted people to put Jade eggs inside your vajayjay yes they did I've been putting bleach tampons up there for too long like and we got to let go easy on the on the couch we have to go gentle here's the thing that men are never fuckin aware of toxic shock since it's real hild a lot of women Oh from fucking Tampa Oh and imagine like you lose limbs too if you're lucky you catch it early enough you lose a limb oh it's it's so but because think about it is this little piece of cotton I mean it's happened to me a couple of times or you're like I I think there might be there might be a stowaway up there I'm not sure there might be somebody hopping the Train I need to check and see if there's any past tampons I'm just remembering it's like that tampon was actually invented by men yeah but it seems like a male invention a male invention to a female problem that we don't have it's like hit it like you guys to mix things you smack him around why are you still stuffing things up there I agree I mean that is a temple you need to be gentle with your coochie and we're just jamming it I know girls will throw up a leg on the on the bathtub on the wall the bathtub and just jam it up there with one finger just recklessly you got to go easy it seems like also it can't be good for it like that blood supposed to come out it's not supposed to get stuck no it's it's I definitely take take it easy with with the you know the clitty cat down there I go gentle with it but do you think that's Nature's Way like before tampons were invented trying to gross out the male monkeys like what would flush it out justjust have it all come out I think there's probably something to at least keeping discouraging discouraging people to stay away from the girl so she can recover and recuperate some of those nutrients lost in that blood I'm sure there's something to that you know there's like something with like gypsies where when women bleed I think it's called like God Josh something like that where when they bleed traditionally people leave them alone and they stay in there like cabin or wherever they're living and everyone just leaves them alone during that week if someone brings up gypsies I think of two things Oh God Tyson Fury and werewolves that's I think of like the gypsy lady reading your palm jewel with the mark of the rules where else would be cool like if you could pick one creature to be real I feel like I know the answer to this because I'm your friend if you could pick one mystical creature to be real and exist now what would it be where it would be pretty cool I think Squatch would be great Squatch would be very cool that probably the coolest and the most like reasonable for sure some Russian guy would hunt them and kill them yeah for sure Putin sure he'd have them on the wall Putin would have it stuffed in his office people be real mad I love that you're saying this meanwhile there's like a fucking caribou I don't know what that is and this thing an elk water buffalo I just imagine a Sasquatch head over no those are primates yeah that's a when you get into the primate like nobody gives a fuck about rats like literally nobody gives a fuck about rats no I mean you're taking over New York City they they they fight they kill each other they if somebody comes they take over territories because there's no more food there's no more restaurants opening those little rats are out in the street same amount of rats but no fish so smart they're so smart like that desperado too we talked about that like you know the thing when the test they did with the rats yes and it becomes like this global consciousness that they have and they get smarter from a test that's done way far away we'll explain what I mean what they did was on one side of the point make sure this is true too they taught him a mouse how to go through a maze on one side of the plant mint might be a rat might be your mouse on one side of the planet and then the mice and the other side of the planet went through the maze quicker because of that so true there would be in the morphic resonance area Rupert Sheldrake yeah yeah he was on the podcast way back in the days eh yeah it's a very controversial idea well it's because there's how do you gauge that it's very difficult to go this is the result of that the cause and effect is a little it's a little cloudy there you know what I think and this is just one of the time I think this some time I'm not married to this but I think that you have the possibility to occasionally get these glimpses of maybe senses that are evolving in human beings and you can call it intuition you can call it some connection you have with someone especially with someone you really love like your family or of duan Zoar someone you really care about and you think about them and then they call it's almost like man this there was some sort of a connection between people that just comes in and out it goes in a like sometimes you're thinking about someone they text you like is that just total coincidence it might be but it also might be that there's some weird hard to define impossible to measure connection that we all share with each other I think it's a beautiful way to look at it I thought about that one day when I was just you know thinking about my dad I was traveling and it made me think about thoughts and how thoughts are almost like messages we send out into the universe to just let somebody else know they're not alone and maybe they grab them through some ways through some realm or portal and it's it's important to like conversation is so important because of that because it makes you it reminds you of things and you draw associations I was talking about my father one day and you know John Heffron yeah sure he sent me a message and it was well my dad was sick and I was just you know very upset about it and John was just like you know I went through the same thing that you did I want to let you know that like hearing is one of the last senses to go when people are sick so just so you know that your dad can still hear you and I had been afraid to call my dad during this whole process because I didn't want to know what he had forgotten and so I beat John sent me that message on a Sunday and because he sent me that message it made me think about my dad and I was like you know what I haven't called him and so long I'm just gonna call him tonight it was like four o'clock in the morning East Coast time he was in his um you know the the what is it like Hospice is what's the last place that people go is it like the nursing home is usually like right before people are passing I think it's like a nursing home well nursing home certainly our place were a lot of people yeah I think that's he went from memory care facility to the nursing home and I called the night nurse and my dad couldn't talk at that point but because I said something and John thought about it and sent me this DM I never met him before and that DM made me want to call my dad and I and I called the night nurse it was like four o'clock in the morning and in Syracuse New York and I go I know my dad can't hear me right now but can you just tell him that I love him and I'm thinking about him and and I've Karen I think her name was she said sure I can go in and I'll tell him I'll whisper into his ear and that's about 4 o'clock and you know about what was at 1 o'clock here whatever the time difference is and so I fell asleep my sister calls me about 20 minutes later my dad passed away right after the nurse went in to tell him that and I can consider that a coincidence sure we can chalk it up to a coincidence or it could be what you're speaking about where there is some sort of deep connection that we have that we can't express or articulate with words even though these words that were sent to me are the thing that motivated me to talk to my dad there's something to the effect that there maybe there's something mystical going on maybe there's something that we're not meant to explain the problem is the word mystical the problem is that we're looking at it like it's some sort of a magic thing we're calling bullshit because so many people pretend to have it and don't and there's no real science to sort of back it up just zero yeah and there's also been like the amazing Randi has put out a reward where James Randi I think it's a million dollars if you can prove any psychic ability no one's been able to win it well how do you prove I don't think things of the brain you'd have to do it through well here's the thing if it is let's just let's just go wild here we nourishing he would never allow this he would cut this off he would entertain it and with a scientific perspective but if you're looking at something like an emerging characteristic of human beings like for instance like we know that we used to be single-celled organisms it's very unlikely that during time we were single-celled organisms like Enoch or we could feel or we could do interpretive dance okay no one was writing books on your single-celled organism so as these single-celled organism come multi-celled organisms become human beings like things are getting more and more complex and more and more skills and more and more senses and more and more of an ability to manipulate their environment and I think that it's only it only makes sense that it there there could be some non-local connection that we have to each other some way without just touching or talking or through visual there's some sort of a connection that we have with each other that we just haven't evolved yet it's on the way it coming it's coming and that's why we long for it that's why we're really interested in psychics we're really interested in pom people that know the fee not just because we want to know what the future is we want some sort of a feeling of hope and interconnectivity but it's not it's not just that it's also that I think we know there's something to it one thing we know there's something there's something grander beyond just this physical existence that we have and then it brings up the whole conversation about the creation or existence an introduction of consciousness consciousness when does that come into the picture when did it come into the picture when was the first thing conscious and what is consciousness is it just sentient is just being aware and looking out for yourself because then dear conscious are rats conscious because it seems they're pretty conscious too it seems like they're I think there's a spectrum to consciousness and I think that one that we're talking about is the beyond you know that like consciousness that next level where it's got to go somewhere right it's got to go somewhere I mean look at our brains our brains are these our brains are like a universe and of itself and it's there in the darkness until death I mean you can't even there's no way to really besides like graphs and everything to really understand the workings of the brain I mean it's firing all this electricity's going off and these little teeny molecules are doing jobs and there's like we said earlier sometimes it works great sometimes it's dogs yeah it's really why a person it's really it's it's so it's so crazy and then there's like this thing that happens in the brain and in the body this like immune response where they send out this molecule it's almost like a Paul Revere of molecules where it lets all the other molecules in the body know that some shits about to go down it's like you know it's like a it's like you know a warning right like adrenaline response yeah but like little teeny if there's actually little microscopic things that are doing these jobs yeah whoo what the fuck how do they start their day right are they waking up like Joe Rogan and going working out for now you don't even know they're there no you don't even know that's why I fucking talked to him bro dude I get it I think it's a good idea I was joking around but also being serious like what you were saying you could do for plants why not why wouldn't you do it for yourself why wouldn't you I mean y'all felt everything is made up of things we can't see self-love right self-love is the most important thing you can express and I think if you don't love yourself the breakdown in the chain is you know we're talking about this whole podcast we've been talking about like trauma and pain and along that life time what determines one person becoming a Joe Rogan or Joey Diaz or even you know somebody who goes on to become a politician or doctor whatever it is what determines them going from that direction to people who are committing crimes and yeah sure there's something on a on a microscopic multi cellular level that is determining these things and in self-love is is a tool to use to sort of I think help help you put yourself on the trajectory of a positive life yeah not green but think it's just it's hard for people to just change gears right it's hard for people who aren't healthy to be healthy it's hard for people don't eat well eat well it's hard for people who are kind of lazy to get their shit together and be disciplined you're gonna get tired you know and if you're that person that automatically seeks comfort and Nothingness all the time anyway it's gonna be hard for you yeah it's gonna be really hard yeah what are your what are your reinforcements and what are you reinforcing this is where I think events are very there's amazing opportunity in events and this is a big event what do you mean events like this pandemic okay I was thinking of my guru terrible I miss like you know events and going out oh I see what you're saying this pandemic this moment in time where everything stops and there's like okay like have you watched any television since then and see people without masks and see people hugging and shaking hands you go ah ah right otter already we've only been on lockdown for a month or so and already we freaked out and we see people hold hands movies we see people kiss people they barely know it's changing behavior yeah it's it is scary because this is what I've been telling people forever when it comes to places like China though people I can't believe that China is military dictatorship in 2020 yeah and if you're not careful that could happen here oh absolutely I can happen anywhere if you're lazy enough but it's here's we have to understand this if it exists anywhere it can exist here and we get all complacent in this idea that that could never happen to us and we're too fucking smart do you know how many people are rethinking their thoughts on safety on security on guns on the food chain the food supply chain people are rethinking just basic survival well that's scary yeah and it becomes that sort of desperation factor and the isn't this like we were talking about you know us being so comfortable we're due for some shit well this is it I mean this is due for some destruction there's a trial run because this ain't shit compared to a big earthquake or if an asteroid hits like there's a big-ass where that's flying by it's a mile wide and it's gonna fly by earth soon a mile wide do you know what a mile wide piece of rock from space would do if it hit us it's it's a planet and I would think it would it would leave a dent or two it's a planet Endor it's aligning maybe the silver lining is that we're getting a little bit of a taste of what a real you know more devastating global pandemic looks like and that's gonna be the deciding factor on our preparations for something in the future occurring yeah they didn't know but now they do so now that they do there better be plans in place for all those other possibilities like those supervolcano like yeah we better destroy it impacts we better re reintroduce the pandemic Department and get those fuckers their job back well we don't even know if they really went away I mean it is very accurate I'm a fuckin moron you're a more and we're all we're all more I love you you're great moron I love you too but this this is now we understand that the way things have been is not necessarily the way things always will be and definitely not things can get a whole lot weirder so we should be fucking careful we should be careful but we should also be grateful I think this is a silver the silver lining hopefully will be us learning how to prepare a little bit more in in you know not argue and debate over these stupid things that don't fucking matter right but I think the reason why we're going on and on about stupid shit was because we didn't have something like this because life was too easy yeah well shit it's never a good complacency breeds contempt right and that's on a global scale scale from oh oh yeah yeah that as well Lisa C was it breed complacency is it I just make up a cliche complacency makes fat asses not the pH kind complacency is a dangerous thing does anybody say pH fat anymore that's not real anymore right that's fat that was like the 90s early googling it says contempt is the first thing failure family operty complacency breeds mediocrity or contempt Oh interesting so familiarity breeds contempt and complete see everything is breathing good we're familiar with our complacency yeah well we need to know what's important and I think now we do have a better sense of it so the real question is whether or not we can learn because people are good at justments when they have to make adjustments then when things slide back they get this sort of the thing we were talking about earlier where you don't want to look at all the possibilities because you will freak out especially if you're doing that apples hell yeah I've been staring away steering away from the edibles I mean I have been doing the blunts but I think people will change when their livelihood and survival threatened yes but will they change to protect themselves or will they change to adapt a new way of life to protect the greater good because I want to be on an earth of people who are protecting human race not Bob Johnson you know what I mean not an individual right because it's then we're just back at square one well though if you look at the history of people we're doing way better now than we were before right we keep doing there's obviously been some peaks and valleys and some mistakes and we're also also aware that you can kind of navigate the future intelligently and if you navigate the future intelligently you make less and less mistakes I think we just now have to reassess the nature of our momentum the nature of the society that we're creating and what what we're trying to do and also the impact that we're having I know this is not sustainable for people to not work and stay home for months it's not sustainable I'm well aware but it's also amazing for the earth off you you look at this the pictures they've taken about the sky above la I mean I went on a hike early on I could see all the way to like Pasadena it smells different it does it doesn't smell it but in in gasoline doesn't smell it doesn't smell like you're being poisoned up by a little bitch a little bit and you are it's not the same as smoking isn't the same as smoking but it's right right next door and that environmental stress that constant exposure to environment environmental stress I mean that affects your mood that affects your health we've got to all move out into the rural area doing that go where are we going to go we got to go on another planet with biden and l ron hubbard people in south dakota right now go and stay out of here I know Arizona's gonna be the new la I mean we're all gonna have to move there Arizona you can have a gun it's easy to get a gun cheap house yeah cheap house the cactus that shoot needles at you literally living inside a Satan's dick for three months out of the year though yeah three months of the year it's a hundred and forty five thousand degrees it's a brutal existence people aren't meant to live in the desert everything's dry crispy and trying to kill you you hear the noises at night yeah what was that creature hoodies and rattlesnakes and occasion they have Jaguars you know that's one of the rare places in North America outside of Mexico that we occasionally see jag Wow yeah they have Jaguars that have been spotted on trail cams and the biologists these wildlife biologists watch it very carefully because there's never been a really strong at least there's no real history of a really strong supply of Jaguars in this country it's primarily a Central and South American animal as well as a Mexican animals it's something that got loose from Joe exotics no it's a real real fuckin Jaguar that made its way from Mexico I mean its habitat is like just deteriorating and it's cruising around Arizona that's wild it's a fuck - it spot like the fucking a Jaguar you dealing with the drug trade like you think you're the number-one problem and then the these cartels that are sneaking coke and just fucking shooting at you like shit I thought I was running things out here and then you got a cousin who's like a cousin Jaguar lives up in Oregon he's like bro you gotta come up here there's so many trees it's nice you can breathe look at this motherfucker Wong wandering around I have that tattooed on me so see the skin down there in the middle side where they're they're looking at that's yeah they found out that this one Jaguar that they had been spotting on trail cameras have been killed in Mexico and what turned into a fucking rug they turn them into a rug yeah how do you feel about that as somebody who hunts all these like that's what women see right before men go down on them that's what it looks like beautiful you should frame that shit I need that picture the colors my office right Jaime we need it oh that's beautiful get that please take a screenshot right now find that that needs to be in the studio don't lose it that is probably a Republican website look Jaguars return to Southern Arizona you see exciting yeah sighs that fucker encampment yeah that's in a zoo that's but just still look at the size of that fucker okay lady they're like 200 pounds those fucking cats they're big they're big they're solo hunters right well when you trip balls apparently in the in the Amazon when the guys do ayahuasca and the Amazon they see Jaguars I think Jaguar entity comes to you yeah you see like Jaguar spirits you need to get away out of your own show I just think I don't know why it was I don't know why but I think it was a really interesting theory about why that is and the the theory is that the more people take a psychedelic drug the more their experience and who they are becomes a part of the psychedelic experience for the next person whoa and does back to that consciousness right so when these people are tripping on ayahuasca in a place where they've been tripping on ayahuasca for 10,000 years they see things that these people who've trip before them were terrified of like snakes Jaguars and fucking dragons that come from the sky have you done ayahuasca only done DMT which is the the chemical version of ayahuasca I haven't done so it's like a synthetic you don't throw up and you don't shit your pants and it only lasts 20 minutes that's not fun I want to shart and not have to explain myself I'm very interested in doing it I just had I would have to carve away the time to get ready for it and also make sure I'm doing it with someone who's a reputable person and then the problem is that it's it's not legal so it should be legal I have a friend who's really working on what I mean it's not legal so you don't you never know what you're getting you have to get through word of mouth you know you have to trust people sketchy it's always sketchy when whenever you're dealing with anything whether it's mushrooms or any LSD if anything somebody's green yeah well if someone's offering you some incredibly potent thing and you don't have a chain of command you don't you have a lab this came from you don't know and like when you get into the world of psychedelic drugs it becomes very fucking weird you have to tread lightly you don't have to tread very very slowly there's no there's no FDA there's no DEA for it and so you're right you're dependent upon these people who are doing these journeys and trips in their homes my friend Jackie staying has a really cool psychedelic platform it's I think it's called meet Delic and and she promotes healthy ways to have a journey in her the one thing she says cuz I've talked her about it I'm like I want to do it but I'm scared she always says safety first like it's so good to be new this need a sitter and the environment needs like you said the environment needs to be right I've never done it but I would only go off of someone like that who is like you know knows the steps well you know we were talking earlier about people that try to get away from the trauma of childhood and one of the better ways that people have found is through psychedelic therapy and psychedelic therapy through MDMA has helped a lot of soldiers and maps is currently working on some studies doing that but also people that have taken psychedelic mushrooms have had great relief from some of the pain that they've had when they were younger because it kind of can rewire the way your brain works now what's fucked up about it is this book is chaos Greg Fitzsimmons buddy wrote it Tom O'Neill he came in and then he worked on this book for 20 years I've talked about it too many times so I'll give you the cliff notes but it's basically a Charles Manson it's all it's all about the 60s and the CIA doing LSD studies and running Elliott and giving honesty to hippies giving LSD to people to try to change their memory giving LSD to people to try to make them do things and have no memory of it after they did it there's connection between the CIA's LSD study and Jack Ruby the guy who killed Lee Harvey Oswald has shot him in that iconic photograph sirhan sirhan the guy who killed Robert F Kennedy all these guys are connected to the psychedelic study including Charles Manson there's someone who's doing drugs they ran a clinic in the 1960s and all till this book came out they went CIA ran a fucking free clinic in haight-ashbury and it closed down three months after this book came out it was they were running it for decades shady shit well he's controlling them but they were they were giving people some sort of psychedelic therapy or they were studying them and giving them psychedelics or they were doing something or using them to motivate they were doing something to people yeah LSD and they were they were letting Manson out of jail over and over again he would get arrested he would violate his parole they'd let him out again he was a part of their program they wanted him to do fucked up shit they wanted him like they're researching him like a guinea pig they wanted to use him most likely to disrupt the anti-war movement so he represented hippies now so everybody was terrified okay so they were trying to put a bad face on hippies and make them crazy so that they appeared crazy but meanwhile they're the ones crazy were making him yeah they were creating the crazy well he was in the he was in jail for most of his life like literally half of his fucking oh I'm doing a terrible job of it but if you listen to the audiobook or you read the book and the book has like 60 pages of citations and references explaining all the stuff that is absolutely provable about what he's saying who funded it Henry a Sullinger well no but it's a great book but it's it's about that it's about rewiring someone's brain with LSD and that Manson learned how to do this while he's in prison through this CIA study and then when he gets out within two years he got out in 67 by the time 69 comes along Sharon Tate's dead they're all living in the mansion he's gotten people murder people and right Pig on the wall all this while he's given them acid he's given him a sin and pretend to take it not taking it or taking just a little and change to the way see both effects no no he wasn't taking it so he was pretending he was taking so he could fuck with them so that they're taking acid and he's programming them getting them to have orgies getting them to do crazy shit murdering people like he was literally was a part of this program and you can prove it by all the times he's been released from jail all of his connections with those guys who worked for the CIA at the time and we're doing those LSD studies all stuff because the Freedom of Information Act it's all been proven they did this thing called MKULTRA where they did mind-control experiments on people in the 60s it ended like 1973 when the guy was running the program died safety kids safety they had whorehouses that the CIA ran and dosed the johns up with acid they thought they were going in to get laid and they had a two-way mirror and these guys would be like fucking sipping tea watching these people take acid and have sex with prostitutes that's it's a fucking nightmare like men sounds like a nightmare this is what happens they came inside when people get power in control you you can justify almost anything one of the things you can justifies you can justify taking the guy was just looking to get his dick sucked and you put him in a situation where you're dosing him up with acid and you're studying him like a rat and he has no idea you're studying him he has no idea what happened you're breaking this poor guy's brain what happened well Harry came home one day and he just saw it demons he started yelling he was in the bed IATI starts shooting his gun next thing you know no more Harry meanwhile she doesn't know Harry got dosed up with LSD because on the way home he'd scraped together a little money let just keep a little rub-and-tug real quick and he goes into this place they like have a drink sit down he drinks all Sun do-do-do-do do-do-do-do-do 12 hours later Harry comes out he has no idea what happened there's no memory of it but he's a different person now and they broke his brain is that like what happens when people think they're being abducted maybe they just were on the CIA program and they were all fucked up at night that's an abuse of power and in in really an invasion of Rights it's just well if you give people power and you don't have anybody standing over them tells them what to do and especially if you're doing something in secret right if you're doing things in secret you ever hear that famous Kennedy speech about secret societies it's really interesting I don't think I have what's really interesting because he was who's struggling with the CIA and a bunch of other secret sort of institutions and government back then and secret societies and he was talking about how a poor and it is to withhold information how dangerous it is but this is sort of one of the reasons why it makes sense like if you give people the power just experiment on these young kids just dose them up with acid just lets experiment on prisoners let's just go to these prisoners look at this guy he's been in jail for 12 years he's a fucking loser let's just give him acid let's talk him into believing he's Jesus with no recovery program no no regard for their person it's so destructive it's it's it's that's really just yeah this is one of one of things in the book that Jaime was freaked out about he claimed to have achieved the impossible he knew how to replace true memories with false ones and human beings without their knowledge well I mean most memories are false but now without denying without detailed in specific incidents he put it in layman's terms has been found to be feasible to take the memory of a definite event in the life of an individual and through hypnotic suggestion bring about subsequent conscious recall to the effect that this event never actually took place but that a different fictional event actually did occur he had done it he claimed by administering new drugs effective in speeding the induction of the hypnotic state in deepening the trance that can be produced in given subjects it sounds like whoever did hypnosis on you did the opposite of that that's that's really so so evil that was his job his name was jolly West and he did this for decades this is a government program he's a really friendly guy sure if you want to go to those conspiracies they were they were real I mean they are provable I mean that is just so it's demonic oh it sounds like it sounds like we're reading us like a movie plot look at this the national security archives in washington DC i found the version of the psycho v psychophysiological studies of hypnosis and suggestibility that the CIA turned over to the senators canada senators kennedy and anyway in 1977 West's name and affiliation were redacted as expected but the CIA's version was also shorter and watered down in comparison this is because he found two different documents about one in the CIA's warehouse and then he found another one that was the one that had been redacted West documents was 14 pages this one was five including a cover page most glaringly there was no mention of West's triumphant accomplishment the replacement of the memory of a definite event in the life of an individual with a fictional event so the CIA's papers had a different account that showed that he could change people's memories and then the one that was all redacted and edited didn't have that in it and these are people who are still there are still people who are like that who are running government and or who are in politics or who are in charge of passing laws like that well here's the question so it does go deep but here's the question should all that stuff is horrendous right all that stuff's horrendous experimenting on American civilians and and fucking with OCP my well breaking people you're like causing schizophrenia oh hundred percent if you're inclined towards it those events absolutely do contribute to schizophrenic breaks that's been proven and it's not just it's like they've actually talked about that that's that Alex Berenson stuff that he talked about with marijuana which is 100% true in people especially with high doses of edibles they have psychotic breaks it happens to people to get schizophrenic they blow fuses it does happen no rarely and I know if people I know of people multiple people that have had real problems I think there's some people that have a sort of a slippery grasp on reality in the first place and then they start smoking a little weed and getting a little too crazy and reckless with it yeah hmm and go deep go deep wake-and-bake every day you're hanging out with the wrong people too and it's the wrong environment in or even worse you're hanging out with no people because you're on quarantine just kidding you don't have any community like it but that's that's why it's so important to have like good people in your life that can get you out of those zones because it's all it is is like a deep dark mental zone and if you don't have a lifeguard on hand yeah you're gonna you're gonna drown in your own mental ocean dude that's what that shit is horrendous and then all those bad ideas are mental ocean sharks and yeah and I doubt they're replacing bad memories with good ones I doubt they're like hey remember that time your uncle touched you at the Reunion here's you winning an Olympic gold I wonder what the memories were that they implanted in the po2 to create Manson hmm I mean well they I know they definitely have taken prisoners and convinced the president they committed a crime that they couldn't possibly have committed you know done that way through a horrendous interrogation and torture they've actually convinced people that they did something they didn't do it well that's how they persuade people to you know to confess and they lead people yeah you know what this reminds me of what we're talking about West world yes it's exactly what it sounds like well what were you creating memories and yeah yeah I mean we're get we're going towards that way world we're going to be if we're not yet me Yvonne thinks we're there right now Yvonne thinks we're alone must thinks we're in some sort of a simulation he wants to know what's beyond the simulation wasn't there percent I mean even Neil deGrasse says there's a percent yeah need to grow I love him I have such a crush on him I'm a CBO sexual congratulations thank you thank you very much I remember there was a lady who got elected to something they're like she's the first pansexual politician openly pansexual politician what's pansexual oh you love everybody having a party but fun yeah hey listen I'm not knocking being a ho that sounds like fun maybe I should I think she basically is allowed to be attracted to everything that's all joking aside I think all must be exhausting maybe maybe it's not sounds kind of great maybe she can go back and forth from men to women but she doesn't consider herself a lesbian she's just she's just alive what is that what does pansexual mean no I think you're right I think they love everyone let's Google I want to know what the urban dictionary says cuz it's the only way you're gonna get a definition that's a true that's a true definite definition please you guys pansexual real thing established I'm gonna say you love you love all walks of identity you like straight people you like gay people you like lesbians you like post-surgery transsexuals not limited in sexual choice with regard to biological sex gender or gender identity exactly well that just means you can be sexual with a trans person straight person or a gay person that sounds so basically a very open person she's a hippie a lover yeah she's out there doing acid ever just opportunity blowjob or the Manson did that's what they did they were all that pansexual I don't know if that's pansexual or more of a control I don't know if they were all pansexual I think you're born that way I think it'd be unless you had the CIA replacing your memories why would you think people are born that way cuz Lady Gaga told me those my sister only she's such a Lady Gaga fan I love my sister she's got two kids a husband she has Lady Gaga's or screensaver on her phone why not why not yeah I mean I must be great just to love everybody I joke around about it and I'll mock it but I'm gonna mock everything this thing's are out there they're gonna get mocked but it doesn't mean it's not great we should be able to mock everything yes or no hundred percent in because the people want to be mocked anything that you can't make fun of it's bullshit it's bullshit and it doesn't want to be made fun of because it's afraid of its truth being revealed okay that creepy dude who says you can pray away the co vid oh yeah oh yeah nigga from my life every book you when the lady confronts him the lady reporter confronts him and asked him if he thinks the poor people are demons I did not say that his eyes they got crazy she asked him if four people were demons and he looked the most demonic I've ever seen a human look the most say and knowing there's a camera there oh look at him he looks like he looks like a he looks like that thing from saw he looks like you would have to fight him to the death if you saw him in your house fuck that guy that guy is the devil that's the irony of people like this he uses people's need and want to belong and be understood for his own gain look at that suit you think it's a fucking polyester suit do you on edge you'd be if that guy was like that in your living room and he was screaming and yelling pointing at you and you're living like oh my god were fighting to the death can you imagine that's you would think you're dating his daughter and you're going to meet him and he's you walk in the house right wait I like it when he's in my house cuz I have to kill him but you go to the upper left when he's pointing at her right there look at that oh don't say that he looks like if Disney instead of making like the presidents like those puppets at the Epcot Center they made a demon look at those white knuckles look how tight he squeezing this fist his hand looks like a old degraded version of an AI they just soar like we're fuck it we're not gonna fix it let's just put this hand on him and just send him back out into the world no the hands is a real age that's where everything else doctored up you're right the doctored up his mug he forgot to get a 50 years old there's no hand jobs other than the regular con he needs to get go to his dermatologist and get a peel on that to show his that's the demon coming out that's how old the demon is it's all hairy and shit but what would you do seriously if he walked in his back was to you and he just turned around he's like shaking a martini and he looked at you you did - yeah depends on who's house if it's in his house Levi get the fuck out of there do you think he get out do you think he makes love you sir does he make love or hate fuck his wife it probably gets fucked only by dudes and they probably come in buses they probably come out out with like execution of Mass on they just run trains on what face and if Copeland I mean it sounds like a have you seen the video of him yelling I come in poser yes you say oh you play it play it I haven't seen it so we will get pulled off of youtube if we actually play it and people can hear it yeah it's their content but oh my god that's when he's rebuking poet Ovid who's the other dude that's this guy who's giving him it in the bunghole on Sunday mornings giving him the Lord I'm picturing large Samoan characters Jason Momoa but like worse bigger just savages ready to lay pipe on so he's about you're calling them a bottom okay does anything wrong with that choice absolutely live your life do you girl I just think that anybody who's doing that look I don't necessarily think it should be illegal to rip people off and demand money and for a jet from poor people I don't think it should be illegal but be honest yeah if you think that you can't be mocked for doing that someone can't ask you a question because you did say that you didn't want to be on playing with all those demons you know like that's why you has a private plane because the regular people are demons yeah did you really say that come on man like you actually said it it's like the same thing with Joel Osteen you know they're just way way less crazy but they have a similar like gloss about them but Joel Olsteen is happy that guys out there is he fuck yes same fucking face no no it should be he's because they're like Joel Olsteen is not like him Joel Olsteen is legit that guy he's crazy he thinks poor people are demons no I think if your your gauging them if there's a graph of like worst ever preacher to best ever preacher somewhere along the line there's got to be a really good person it's a preacher that it really is following the word of Christ and is doing it the right way and is if they do get money they are giving it away to charity there's got to be so you think Joel's on the better end of that he's closer to that sides to this the fucking there's he sells tickets where you can only look at his ass they probably cost a thousand bucks look there's there's tickets behind him Oh God sells sex and God sells like if comedies done I'm going to God and look at the people that sit behind their ass there's like so many people that they stuffed people on the stage with them that is so wild and this is this is another example of people needing and going towards love and I'm sure there's obviously a benefit to this it's just it's another level of religion that I don't quite understand in my mind can't grasp it because it feels like it's it's teetering a little bit further away from religion and going into something else another realm that is the opposite of what religions meant to be well it's finance it's a business that's that's what I mean if you have you're selling out that big of a place and that you're getting donations from those people to look how many of those people are tithing how many people are giving ten percent thirty thousand people giving you ten percent oh my goodness so you're like paying you're paying God essentially so it makes God appear like a like a like a mafia like a member of the Mafia you treat me good I'm gonna give you some money just protect me it's basically like a mafia member I think the idea is that these guys the more baller these guys are the more they represent God's Word and God's Word has allowed him to get a jet in the Rolls Royce and look at this mansion that's paid for by God's Word God is good god is gonna have it and then people see that and it's like sort of they get they get pumped up but like god is good look what God's done to brother Joel Joseph falling out of control joella's Royces and private jets he's just so I don't know why his face is so taut it is Jesus hanging on to his ears and riding Joel like it like Seabiscuit and directing him because his face is very intense he's just on point focused that's how you sell a fucking arena woman he's running towards God girls are always worrying about what the guy looks like the guys selling out arenas with Jesus's worth he's reading a book that was written 2,000 years ago he didn't write it he's reading out there given these sermons and he's bawling look how it happiest he's like I'm not even gonna get my teeth bleached fuck he's laughing fifty thousand people a week it says he has great how much money is that that's a lot that's a lot of millions I mean he's like the Chappelle of sermon dwarfs the saw dwarfs climbing hard wharfs everybody attendance hopefully people are getting what they need from that good but he looks fucking crazy what is uh his sermons like have you ever listened to no no no but I mean he must he's filling up the sixteen thousand seat arena about three times to 50,000 people a week are getting in there good lord quite a few well after the UFC was at t-mobile I think I think the UFC seats twenty-two thousand at t-mobile somewhere on that range and he was there he was there looking after us he does twenty two thousand people in Vegas that's a strange shift of energy like you know from a UFC to g.od it's a strange shift have you ever had a show where it felt religious a show yeah for you or it was like it was so good and you were so tuned in that you got offstage and was like man that felt like I feel like God right now no I've had shows it feels surreal but life feels surreal yeah yeah my life feels very surreal but um no never like they felt religious because you're humble well I mean and still do it I did what I do like you have to have a certain amount of belief in yourself yeah to be able to do things either on camera or on stage or you know in the moment you gotta have a certain amount of belief in yourself it's like all comedians are insecure narcissists but you Teeter on this line of I don't have you're the only friend I have is a male who you're really well-balanced in that area like your ego I've never seen you lose your shit and you risk you treat everybody the same but you also respect your that's very nice of you but I definitely lost my shit I'm sure I can tell I mean your your tattooed from your knuckle to your clavicle I'm sure there's some shit going on where you've lost yeah for sure but you you also you respect your boundaries and you you aren't afraid to be like this is my space I don't need you in it but with a smile well you gotta be careful in this town especially there's so many people that weasel in the try to weasel into your circle and be your friend and then start asking for things and like it's not subtle at all yeah they're like sycophants it happened so quick it's like all of a sudden someone's hanging around its friends this guy and sees you places and then they want to get your phone number and then wants to talk to you about a project it's like there's so many of them out here that are like trying to hustle their way into people's lives but they're don't you think like I don't know about you but I see him coming a mile away yeah we do but they're still around like it's it's in this town especially when I was doing television stuff oh my god television stuff is littered with these people because it's all about like making these connections with each other and in the relationships you have with Studios and producers like everybody's sort of like working right so it's like everybody's like can you introduce me to Tom Tom at MGM you know Tom do you just send him an email just an email Tom this is a great script I'd really like to introduce many of those there's so many people like that it's exhausting it is exhausting if you don't change your number every now and again you'll get stuck with them I love that you do that again two months ago I've two numbers and I change them both now it's smart yeah and it also you then you you realize who you want to keep in your life you at least want to communicate with and send your energy to I can't imagine being like Tom Cruise I can imagine like someone is that sounds like you can impossible to imagine how you manage that I know it's why the guys jumping off buildings he's hoping he falls you know yeah Scientology oh yeah yeah that's how he manages it would you start a new cult he's me it's so is it excuse my knight naiveness in this situation is the head man and Scientology still got or is it l ron Hubbard is there is the entity that thinks he's I mean they say things like to LRH and their fucking salute him and shit but I think they think of a Muslim like a guy who just sort of like brought them the word and then the word is the true origin story of human beings with the thetans and they were frozen they threw him into the volcano and the necessarily the Word of God it's just the word of the aliens he created as well that's it's an alien thing it's like I think to paraphrase it and butcher it I think the idea is that you are like using this shell and then you have this thing that's inside of you that really has come from like other galaxies and it was released here and now it's trapped inside your body or some fucking wacky shit but the writing do the writing so bad movie please get high and do a simulcast pool you have to tell me you have to give me I'm gonna ask you some pointers after make sure I nail it just do it where it's just you and a bong and Battlefield Earth that's what it should be called yeah you sitting there on the couch crisscross applesauce bar and every now and then you're like oh my god he just hold on just like this is so crazy movie is so wacky but that movie's probably a million times better than the book the book itself like I'm telling his writing was so awful that it's confusing it's like how did he do this and he even wrote the orissa was quoted as saying if you really want to make money start a religion really quoted saying that he was take pictures of him with hit captain's jag on a bunch of metals he gave himself I mean it's like it sounds like mentally old you have to read going clear it's great I didn't really listen to it listen to it it's amazing I actually going clear I read at least one or two of the chapters I actually sat down and read it but most of it I listened to it's amazing it's amazing like can you realize like what he was he was like this guy was mentally ill who was trying to self-diagnosed and then self heal and then came up with this whole system of like Dianetics this whole system of how to like manage your mind and and that and again for some people it actually is effective because it gives them a structure well yes you know the silver lining to his mania is that he managed his mania and then made fucking cash he's dead either way yeah yeah I mean that's that's what it says who knows there's so much money there like one of the number one real estate holders in all of Los Angeles it's creepy when you drive by there the main building and psychiatry kills we've seen that yes yeah they do people that go into there they don't even know they're going into a Scientology building they think they're going in for some anti-psychiatry think it is it is a little you know the whole thing is misleading the whole origin of it is misleading what is maslany the guy probably believed everything he said he's probably out of his fucking mind if you really pay attention to what l ron Hubbard was he seems like he was lying constantly he's probably a maniac was he a result of the CIA chaos no he's pre this but have you ever seen the interview where Tom Cruise is on with Matt Lauer on The Today Show and Tom Cruise is mad at Brooke Shields on psychiatric juggs yes and he's like reaching out to her like he's saying how he can like what she needs to heal yeah yeah yeah and he's he's so intense dude he looks suited on something look at his face it's so intense I just think he's very adamant about this particular aspect of the Scientology belief system and one of the things is they don't believe in psychiatric drugs there's - or I'm pretty sure that I believe in any of those right is that but but the conversation is so interesting I wonder if you did like a personality trait test of the people who are followers of the Scientology religion what the common denominator is amongst them dude you really want to see something amazing they see Tom Cruise's graduation speech what was that that one way stood on the podium and they gave him like the most amazing man of all time metal they gave him a medal like a gold medal it's of a fucking hubcap and it's hanging around his neck like Flavor Flav and he's somebody who leaked this it is fucking amazing so the head guy of Scientology that guy gets it from they salute each other because they're in the fucking army they hug like in a crazy like they both probably came there and then Tom Cruise goes up they give him this gigantic dinner plate of a metal and this this is like a speech it's like a pump up speech that was like a Scientology thing look at his medal he won most awesome human of all time and so he's standing there in front of this huge globe behind him this issued image of the earth behind him this huge seal freedom Medal of Valor Medal of Valor it's amazing most amazing person of all time medal based off of what what the fuck ever you hater imagine how crazy you have to be to stand there in front of these people with this goddamn dinner plate hanging off of your neck and then at the end they salute to l ron Hubbard they look they look at the picture when they go tell our secret society there's the photo of our age decor it looks like the inside everyone gets up and salutes to LRH dude he looks like the thing from Ghostbusters the painting I would like to join just for fun Hugo remember that see how much they can convince you what is it there you go Vigo you know what I'm talking about how much could they convince you if you had to live like a Scientologist like if you just said like a look I am going to do a thought experiment and I'm going to study all their work and I'm going to be non-critical about all this and I'm gonna live my life but and I'm gonna do it for three years people have tried to do that probably just like for fun on their own because they're so bored like what would happen if they didn't like yeah happens if they get caught yeah but you'd have fun yeah you'd have to be in the system what if they just want that was like their last hope and they just were hoping it would help whatever issue they had I'm sure that's happened both ways how many people have looked at the success of Scientology though and going I need to do something like this but they never did probably everything can you it's like a comedian looking at you being like I fucking I should I wish I thought of that but being mentally ill well just be well no I mean you downplay yourself but you know your your topics and your jokes I'm it's the same shit no I got lucky and that there's an actual job for something that I just I'm now it just fits in with my rambling curiosity yeah some a Rambler and I'm curious so it's like oh look a this is a job right here it wasn't even a job before it's just a a recent job but but if you see Waco the Netflix I had no idea I knew about the story I was young when it when it went live during the actual time but watching that that again like there's a certain type of personality that is attracted to having a leader and it goes back to like what did you experience in your childhood where you needed that but again the guy always fucks all the wives look small small guy he's helping him fucking help you out I'm not fucking your wife I'm your best friend I would never fuck your wife my dick was inside of her but that's different I was fucking her jesus is fasting you and he strengthening your resolve can you can you heal from this are you gonna be able to find what you need from within and then he would sing terrible songs and then just walk in then he'd just disappear through the doorway did anything like green die please don't I think he did I think there's a video of him singing Green Day branch davidian branch davidian go Texas dude that was such a that was so tragic you know yeah Ted Nugent lives near there of course he does he probably helped out he probably goes in which is is near the location you know I almost bought his car what do you mean his car was for sale Ian in 1968 Camaro it was for sale oh it's a big year for Camaro it is a good year I love and it was for sale online and I saw it was like oh I'm fucking buying this and I picked up my phone and I went like then I looked and I'm like do I really want that fucking bad juju in my life you knew it was his car yes it was a hundred percent his car yes certify that it was Carmike did look is that bad voodoo yeah it has to be I mean if we're talking about there being some sort of bright realm of consciousness and things existing outside of the physical world there's some bad juju I was killed by the feds and they burned his family alive oh why I'm told and they lied about it they shot fire out of the fucking nozzle shooting women and children and drove over the walls knew the women and children were inside drove over the fucking walls and lit that place on fire and barbecue those people well that was a real I think a lots going on there I think it also was like a breakdown in protocol and gonna handle a high tense situation I think that's how they've always done it I just think this time it got caught on tape that's what I think I think if there's ever been some sort of situation where people are armed up look at Ruby Ridge there's a bunch of situations in history where they decided to put their fucking boots on the back of someone's neck because they wanted to let that person know they're they're not going to resist and that's one of the things that people do when they're in a position of power that's why power so dangerous it is every single time people get this sort of ultimate power it winds up being abusive it was with with with a certain person and it becomes like the difference between like you know somebody who does good for the world and in community and somebody who does yeah evil shit it's such a hard job to be a leader of anything whether it's a leader of California or a leader of the country or a leader of anything like being a leader of something like Jesus well every decision you make is scrutinized and your whole platform is built off of lobbyists and people who have invested interest and it's it how do you make a decision and how do you commit to your own decision have faith in it where you must lose yourself you must have to lose yourself in order to be able to make those decisions but then how are you able to make decisions without yourself being connected to it you must deal with criticism because you have to be able to address people's concerns so you have to take some criticism and that's probably nonsensical and angry and ridiculous and then some of it that actually is constructive and makes sense what do you think was the president who handled that the best that you've seen in your lifetime to handle Obama I think he's the best speaker of all the presidents because there's something about Clinton I didn't like his little fake smile he's smirky you just knew he blew a load on the dress he still was an amazing speaker he's still an amazing speaker he was charismatic yeah and sometimes he would knock her out of the park but it's just like you don't too much about him afterwards to judge him in the most objective way it's maybe if I just looked at his ability to speak versus Obama's ability to speak they're both pretty amazing they were definitely both amazing I think Obama had had a calming factor mm-hmm I feel like when other presidents have spoke for just from my I don't really know you know a lot about politics are claimed to be an expert but like when Donald speaks or other presidents before Obama it cause like an anxiety there was like a tense yeah behavior around it like the way they spoke was very I don't know stress inducing but Obama was kind of velvety he had a way of delivering things and you felt like you was a guy you could actually hang out with like I remember seeing him on board a and show they were in Vietnam eating and drinking beer and I'm watching azomite what motherfucker can just hang out yeah like you can walk into any room and and make it his room but he can hang out in a way like that I don't think Trump can hang out like Trump's got to be the center of attention it's got to be a big deal that trumps there it's got to be you know you know I'm saying like Trump would have to be he's not gonna hang out with you in some weird fucking restaurant in Vietnam after he's out he's not talking about like the flavor notes of the sauce on the on the pork he's not gonna be able to make foods and different different cultures that cook in a different way it seems like when Trump but when Obama spoke he was able he felt like he was in the moment in present yeah like he was aware of what he had to deliver but was also aware of his the way he was delivering it Trump seems like he's always someplace else yeah and Obama's I mean there's been a lot of there was a lot of bad policies or a pastor and the Obama administration particularly when it comes to whistleblowers they were or the worst on whistleblowers ever and there's there's also some real erosions of freedom of speech and of surveillance real erosions of that a lot of drone attacks Jesus Christ there was a lot of drone and a lot of fucking innocent people died during those Toronto attacks so it's like there's no president that gets out and just nails it no there's no immaculate presidency it's a dirty job and it's I don't ever know I don't know if it ever wasn't a dirty job I mean look at the the the nature of what it is you're ruling over people and a lot of different through the types of people and in so many different laws and States it's a lot to keep under control and then you have to worry about the types of people who are you know on the lower levels of politics and how they're making decisions it's gonna worry about the type of people that want to be President to the right mind why do a babe and he's still a babe but total dome it is in a little juicy no not juicy a squirty little squirting Timmy's a lil squirt for Obama that's my new bumper sticker no he clearly he clearly you know why because I think you read the briefings and I think he cared and I think he probably worked some fucking ungodly amount of hours and I think you probably freaked him out once he got in there and realized how dangerous the world really is if you like that's people have wondered like why did he not do what he said he was gonna do during his campaign and why did he change a lot of that once he got into office and one of the thoughts is well they say a lot of things cuz they don't really give a fuck they just want to get in there and once they get in there like trust me I'm a good guy once I get in there I'll be fine but I got a lot of you and say there's all this stuff that I'm gonna do that I know I can never do the other thing that people say is when you get in there and then they change your perspective and they show you the briefings they show you all the terrorist activities they show you all the danger in the world and you realize like oh my god and you're responsible for making the right calls to zig and zag and make sure you avoid all the fucking trees on the way down the hill you're probably right that's a very smart way to look at that I think it affected him right down to his core yeah they become a different person he's almost like you hope they do if they're human they become a different person yeah but I mean you you not who you said you were going to be when you were running for president and it's I think it's I bet a big factor is the access to information and then they're talking to the top intelligence agencies and then the top talking about all the people that are lifetime in in White House in in you know in Washington and they can let you know how everything really works in the in fuck and then all you're really doing because it's if you look at the span of a lifetime and then a span of a president being an office if he gets re-elected there's so many things for you to address that how do you even get to to doing all of the things on your on your daily to deuce you end up spending more time talking about the policies as opposed to actually putting them into play it's so hard to check all those boxes that's the case with I think all kinds of government and that's one of the we're the reasons why I'm very patient about this whole reopening the government thing not that I don't think we should do it eventually but I look at it like a battleship and I think I don't think this battleship can make quick turns I mean I think it's shut off real quick and you know freaked everybody out and there's been a lot of crazy adjustment but I think the battleship is still turning really slowly and to get it to a point where you're gonna maneuver it into the harbor because you're back to work again whoo like how's that gonna look is that just gonna be wide open back to work again right and what do we do if the virus flares up again are we gonna be able to accept the fact that the data shows that it's not as dangerous or or we're gonna look at and say yeah it's not as dangerous but is it not as dangerous because we quarantined everybody right which is probably true yeah which probably the truth is it's probably not as bad as they thought it could be or would be or we're worried that it would be but maybe maybe it still needs to be something that we need to stay away from I don't know I think if it's if it doesn't turn out to be as bad as everyone thought then we're learning that something worse is going to come and we need to we're learning if if something yes if and when something worse comes that we need to improve our equipment supplies in our you know our standard mode of protocol and in how we're reacting to these things honest honest like in a system level but now we know you know what makes me happy honestly legitimately makes me happy is that most people complied most people shut down their businesses most people stayed the fuck home it's not like people were rebelling aisle but no but but they still have done it for over a month which is a crazy thing yeah to tell people to go anywhere and not go to work for a month and most people comply that's pretty fucking amazing this is the first thing I've done in quarantine that was outside of just walking my dogs and maybe go in the grocery store with my man once in a while you when you guys shop do you stock up kind of but it's hard to stock up when you eat like I eat perishables so it's hard to stock up on perishables part you got eat bullshit food that preserves and that stuff that stuff affects my mood rice and beans gross mac and cheese is in big old dumpsters they go garbage cans full of rice and beans if you had a garbage can full rice how many years a long I mean you ate rice every day probably a long long time how much could you live on rice and butter if you just have rice and butter I think that some kids that's all kids eat when they're like up until they like 10 years old dogs chopped up in there if you're over 12 and you eat hot dogs with ketchup fuck off it's crow supposed to be mustard you weirdo but it should be mustard should be mustard and the bun should be toasted just a little bit sauerkraut every time some relish I'm like that's candy rude you stay on your side of the table Stan my Andy so sweet and everything fucking up is that your like junk food like what is your ultimate junk food I love in New York City Oh what Joey Diaz calls it dirty water hotdogs yeah it's dirty water dog snap when you bite into him I prefer the kosher dogs those are the best if you get large they just prayed over yeah well they slaughter them differently but the the if you have like there's a couple of different companies I don't know they were slaughtered differently yeah yeah that's the whole thing of something being kosher a rabbi has to be there and it's actually a really bad way for the town of die cuz he knows he's like awful because guys here hang them upside down cut their throats ah man see look I I try and like my wife's dog though it does it does some really juicy I try and live my life in a you know where I'm being as good of a person as I can but I got it burgers are so good or so they're so good so I'm not a bad person because I like a burger do you want some wild of me will you curse fuck yeah oh my god my man was like you got to get some elk all right I got it for you my god far we've dude we've done almost three hours and a half oh wow has it been like three and a half hours we've covered a lot what do we got right now 322 Wow dude dude that blunt really kicked us off I was a little scared at first I got a little to hell I'm going down this hill I can't stop no you're natural well it's not even an interview it's a conversation that's why this podcast is so good well it can only be good if I have friends like you you're sweet no you are no I really appreciate that but I'll show you I really do you're one of my favorite people always loved hanging out with you we have a lot of fun at the store it's always fun to do these with you and your real that's what I like you know I think real recognized as real as cheesy as that is but are we rappers now no we're just humans expressing our heart real recognizes real but the one thing I realized in this quarantine because I've become I've sat more in the fan seat because I'm not performing as much so I'm like experiencing it from the other side and how important your show and your podcast is to the fabric of society like your comedians always talk about there's a preposterous things no it's not Joe it is you are important because of the very subject matters that you have on this show well sometimes I can get lucky and get a guy like Michael osterholm on and tell Pete that was the guy that alerted everybody to how bad this was really gonna be right we see this CD I see guy know he's the guy that's an infectious disease expert that wrote this book deadliest enemy oh yeah he was on and everybody went holy shit cuz everybody's like should we take this seriously is this anything and then he did this podcast and then like four hours later I got a call from Dana White's like dude what the that podcast is freaked everybody out Syd wrap right the center of infectious disease research oh you're right you're right Syd wrap that's exactly what you'll do you smartypants oh I'm like you I am looking for me no but I like maybe it scares you to hear that or not you're just fucking around but like there's a few there's a gap in in availability with information and like fake news and all that shit your show is important because you you have an unbiased approach to who you have on and it's all it's just a wide spectrum of information and it's a great place for people to have an area where they can come and learn from things they may not really agree with well here's what I'm really lucky we're really lucky is that there's something that I'm doing that reaches this insane number of people but also has no one telling me how to do it fuck yeah so is no one telling me that I can't get this guy on or don't get this author on nobody gives a fuck about this book we've got Rob Lowe's coming in or you know whoever the side there's no network dude saying no to Alex Jones yes because of what it would do to your fans and your ratings exactly and and also fighters like what are gonna talk to them about who do the fighters I mean what about these authors you have friends who are doing their podcasts with a professional production group and they're having these kind of conversations fuck that and they're saying there they go dude I feel like I'm working on a TV show this is crazy like I'm like just let me do the thing and I'll do if this episodes not so good I'll do better and then the next time be better but let me have on the people that I can a get people that are willing to do it and then P B I'm actually interested in that's what's gonna create the good content I need to be interested in this shit the only way I'm gonna be interested in what you're talking about is if you're actually interested in it if you're talking about some shit I mean you could be talking about playing the piano I don't know jack shit about playing the piano but if you're really into it and I hear people talk about it I get fascinated I when I wasn't listening this conversation about go about playing that game go and how complex that game is and about oh this is one of the reasons why that deep blue computer beating go beating like a really top level world champion go player is so extraordinary because this is an incredibly creative game that's really complicated and I don't know shit about go but I was riveted well I was just riveted and you explain my mouth is open I was like well I think passion definitely is an alluring yes it's it's it's a defining factor for creativity and that's where you know you know we got to just take control of what we want to do and just put it out there and fuck fuck censorship and fuck what people think if you're passionate about it then that's all it matters Jesse may tell everybody about your show oh it's called sharp tongue pod and I talk about a lot of shits things I like to listen to and like to talk about subjects that that matter to me will you consider my offer to do that simulcast while a bong please do free thing yes with a bong you Battlefield Earth and a couch absolutely I will as long as you get me that oak me Jesse may provoke you thank you my friend laughing I love you too always good to see you bye everybody [Music]
