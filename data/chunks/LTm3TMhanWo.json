when you see thousands of people that are innocents that got killed by drones a million innocents killed in Iraq if that's not a crime against humanity what is it crime against a lot of comes up that people would want to vote on like the bailouts the war or other thing things of this nature there's a lot of things that people would like it's gonna affect us we would like to vote on this but you don't get to vote on you get to vote on a representative these people gonna represent you once they get into office and think about some of the laws that are in place that protect corporations think about some of the laws that are in place that people over every day they wouldn't be there people were voting for them we all have this this desire to have someone lead us we all have this this feeling where we need someone who's smarter and wiser who represents us you know and when you're really dumb the problem is really dumb people they get a say in everything - and there's it they're subject to a lot of tricks they're subjects to the they're subject to nationalism they're subject to these kind of ridiculous rah rah rah America speeches that don't say jack they say nothing it's all just this cheerleading event and then they're subjective they can't help it they're dumb they don't know they're being bullshitter D they grew up around dumb people they go to work with dumb people there's no one in their family that's interesting or asks any questions at all and they just get sucked right into it man as a society is so greedy we're willing to go to war we're willing to go places and send these big metal machines that kill people and people up just so we can make more money and the way our society is set up I mean I've heard it argued and argued successfully that our society runs on war you know it runs on the domination of the other parts of the world and literally that's the only way you can control a gigantic chunk of the globe you have to keep everybody down you know and that's what our society is based on we can't be fighting over each other because you know this guys are like a million people died in Iraq I never goes hey long as it doesn't happen over here but it is that is over here it's just over here over there it's the same thing and some people you don't know that were born somewhere else who got jacked you get trapped in that whole idea of you know this is my team these are my people and you know someone  plays a country music song and throws up a flag and I man it it feels good feels good to be in right feels good god Bless America feels good singing around with a bunch of other people and you're all drinking what a  badass on the planet whoa and that's how people get recruited it's a clusterfuck man these poor  kids man she imagine being 18 19 being talked into doing a for a bunch of bloodthirsty who just are trying to get whatever they're trying to get over there whatever the  it is whether it's lithium you know minerals in the mountains that they used to make cellphone whether it's ninety percent plus of the world's opium supply ninety percent that is a multi multi-billion dollar business and if you think these industrialist  that are running the world are gonna leave that money behind you're  crazy dude they've got United States Army troops guarding poppy field there's so much heroin there I mean it's incredible brother of the President of Afghanistan his brother was selling heroin and getting paid by the CIA I mean god dammit heroin is absolutely addictive okay people who try heroin get hooked heroin is everywhere okay so you need to sell it someone's selling it who's selling it I don't know but 90% of it comes from this one place where we have to be to save our freedom you you can't criticize it because if you criticize it you're a shithead you don't appreciate the troops and what they're doing for you and that's not the case at all I just don't like the idea of these people leading us in any direction where you need to sacrifice your life well I don't believe it I don't believe them and there's been so many lies I mean the more you look it up the more they may go go into any of the stories on the weapons of mass destruction before we invaded and compare them to what we actually know that they really knew when they said that it's like they did it on purpose they wanted to get in there for whatever reason and if it's some crazy the world is gonna end if we don't stop this but we can't tell you like I would love to believe you I would love to believe that the reason why you're you're not telling us exactly what the is going on is because you're really protecting us from some insanely evil thing that if we knew about it it would society would collapse but our strong brave powerful leaders are going to guide us without our knowledge I would love to believe you if you weren't all full  we're gonna have to step back and look at it all in a different way and I don't think you're gonna get that from just voting for president dealing with all this nonsense that we have right now with the with the two-party system it's we're spinning our wheels we're not getting any traction it's all nonsense the same nonsense with Obama that we dealt with with Bush special interest groups controlling what people say and do what direction the country goes in and save us from the bad guys shut the up man it's the same nonsense Operation Northwoods was something that was plotted out during the 1960's signed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff where they were going to fake terrorist attacks on American civilians and blame it on the Cuban so we could go to war with Cuba and involved a bunch of  like blowing up a jetliner they were gonna have a drone jetliner blow it up and say that people died on it and this is gonna get everybody fired up but going to war with Cuba they were gonna attack want Onam obey they were gonna armed cubed friendlies to attack Guantanamo Bay so that we would have to go to war with Cuba this is like our own government they plotted this out this is like real I remember when I was I saw JFK the Oliver Stone movie and that was like part of the premise that JFK that Oliver Stone was was pushing in his film is that they killed JFK because they want to stay in Vietnam they were making a lot of money in Vietnam and I remember the time seen that movie going that is absolutely ridiculous who the  believes that is they gonna start Wars and keep Wars going just so they can make money even though it's not a real war thought of just war nobody wants to go to war that stupid hippie  well as I got older and I started investigating history you know from way back to Vietnam to the Gulf of Tonkin to all the that happened when Kennedy and Nixon were in office all the that happened with Reagan in the Contras in Nicaragua no sentient Easterners and all the different various things that have happened in human history where it's clear that the United States is you know we're around with all kinds of things all the time to make money and if there's a bunch of people that are profiting off a war and then they're not just popping like a little bit of money here and there you know you look at like what so I was like what how much money Halliburton made for the war we're talking like billions and billions of dollars that's like real money Eisenhower leaving office and he's giving a speech warning the American people about the power of the military-industrial complex you know when you watch that you're like well here is a sitting president who's leaving office and but was the most important thing that he wants to tell people is that you have to be careful because there's a machine here that wants to go to war there's a business behind going to other countries and locking people up and taking their and they come up with reasons to do this and they sacrifice American lives to do this and they do it for profit and it sounds absolutely ridiculous it sounds absolutely outrageous that the greatest country on earth could be involved in something like that from the get-go but yet that's what history says that's how it points it points in that direction it points in that direction that it's going in and the council's of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military-industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes tower seven disturbs me the most that tower seven just went whoosh just like a controlled demolition and everybody's like yeah but it had holes in the building you see the hole in the building yes I see the hole in the building but wouldn't it fall towards that hole why is it falling like that that doesn't make sense to me with Tower seven the way Tower 7 fell it just kinked in the middle and fell down freefall speed almost I mean everybody like they'll nitpick at you always one tenth of a second slower than freefall even if it was just close to freefall that's crazy there was no resistance it just gave up why we didn't like wiggle and collapse towards where Jack got jacked it does it just seems like a controlled demolition that that bothers me
