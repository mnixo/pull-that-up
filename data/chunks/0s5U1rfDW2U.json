the girag and experience nothing destroys bullshit like marijuana and when someone's bullshit in your high like oh come on man don't even say that right just stop like it's so obvious this is not true this is not a true things la man is not a god it's everywhere there's a people walking out here Mary miss and tell me the two plus two is 18 I'm like what the fuck away stop making all this noise Scientology talking about or just people to people in la that aren't used to being told no you're wrong what you're saying is just absolutely for shit hold on it right you know or how about this you're lying stop walking it's a little bit that going on oh my god it's unbelievable you know one of the things I was saying to a friend we're talking about one thing that I don't like about people that are struggling especially struggling as actors it's the arena that they're forced to compete in the arena they're forced to compete is an arena where they're constantly going to auditions where there's this weird social thing going on where there's one person who's in control the casting director and there's a director who's observing you and your whole thing is about getting these people to like you quickly in a brief amount of time and so they adopt like really obvious Democratic left-wing sort of tendencies and things to say and they adopt you know a very left-wing mindset because that's the majority of the people in Hollywood really left wing and they start spewing out shit that they think people want to hear as opposed to having a real thoughtful opinion on something that's that's a very good point very few people have the luxury of having a real thoughtful opinion it's all about getting someone to like you it's all about getting into the door that is so that's a little true man terrible way to think that's the other day that is so true that becomes this this way of do you have to see you half you're bullied into speaking a certain ways if you don't you're gonna be yeah I'm sidered a shithead or you know not on the team man you don't know team and and you see it all the time well the left-wing aspect of it is very strong mike hill's ideas you know Jimmy schubert ever get what he goes love you told yourself you know a liberal conservative or whatever because he wants to work in jovah's like you know he's human because ever go to an audition with a mitt romney shirt on do it not a sacrifice would ever hire you that's something that would they were really it would prejudge you for sure go get this guy out of here that is a hard game to acting man i know there was a what I lived in that building in Koreatown there was a actor guy that lived in my building uh you know it's starting to get up there an age for an actor or whatever and I guess his was work kind of dried up and for some reason when I would see this guy he would tell me everything about his life for some reason he thought we were you know whatever great friends I've told the guy very little about me right he just would always just spill all this information about himself and I remember him telling me because it was a bar downstairs in that building and him tell me one night the I'm getting out of show business story I love the like you and I were talking about never even considered stopping doing this well I so I it kills me when somebody gives the I'm getting out of show business speech you know Kevin my all I've done what I can do yeah yeah a kiss and then all the phone is he so the guy you know because nothing that gone on for him he hadn't worked in a couple years and then he got this little role on Deadwood likes I don't maybe one line or you know he was on a horse or something and then like and that you know that rejuvenated his spirit but I remember the guy telling me sometime after that that this girl had dumped him and he's just he's just incredulous he can't believe it happened and he just keeps saying to me but I was on Deadwood and whoa I want to dump you who could dump me yeah but I was on this town allows you to reinvent yourself and reinvent your own you invent your own reality man it's a girl also we not want to be involved in life with someone new you know what a mutt people do that a mutt thing to say yeah yeah dumb it was another time where there was a little cafe on the corner and he was I was like a sunny Sunday or something he was sitting in front of their reading the big Sunday newspaper and he had the homes section he's looking through and I'm just being a smartass tonight I'm you know I walk up to him I God your career must be doing really well now if you're looking at the at the home section and he looks up in this paper and he just goes now just day dreaming and you know what I'm gonna do one day when I can afford a house I'm gonna build walls so high to keep the shit in this city away from me oh there's like it was just like the most venomous angry guy that angry like it's a sunny Sunday loosen up you talk you know what you so hard no I got a great story this is so a wall to separate all this come from I knew a guy my acting class you know how long I was in acting class years I loved it by the way for a lot of reasons mainly because it was just fun to be in a just there was a lot of craziness and joe would always make fun of me but there was a guy really good guy normal guy so I thought and he was and I hired him to shoot me to shoot this audition so I go to his house and he's got this great camera and on his wall is a dream board and on his wall is his no no no he's put his face he's put pictures of his face yeah I the cover of Vanity Fair and those magazines he's got slogans saying you're the guy you're the one and it's a dream board Wow and it was big was good cover this whole wall man and he's a good guy and he's a normal guy in a lot of ways he's just been told the wrong things as Jay Davis know what is not she loved that's almost like you know go to a girls house and she's got too many stuffed animals on the bed that's like the male equivalent yeah he thought it shows his man so much down even though he was trying to visualize his future and it never I've never gone always never gonna happen bro oh I shouldn't say Jay Davis jaidev's very nice he's a great guy this is a good galaxy through no yeah the reason it is Jay so enthusiastic like Jesus levels aboard yeah Jays just an enthusiastic guy who's just you know loves everybody but but uh this guy handsome tall you know suave and Justin dolls like you're a dork bro I gotta help you take that down right now his picture his face from over celebrities faces on Vanity Fair and People magazine not kidding well without negative visualized himself doing that that's all dane cook up big well I don't know Cho stop bringing him say you're gonna run into that guy and he's not gonna have made it and he's gonna go you're the reason I'm not meeting somebody he's a good guy you wanna see her the best for my love the guy actually he's a great guy it's just that's the he was told what happens sometimes as people are told something enough times and they forget to stop and think it's exactly we're talking about what the Fox thing is like who says you can't swear and why are you doing with somebody why's it why are you doing with a corp you forgot the idea of a podcast you have to keep thinking because you'll make choices sometimes because you're told that this works yeah who said it works I can't visualize running pumps back in the NFL or fighting in the Octagon don't have it no matter what I do ain't gonna happen I'm getting fucking knocked out because my bone structure or for a thousand reasons I don't have it ok tried didn't work so you know you've got it you yes you should dream big but you should also be realistic with who you are so what you're saying is if someone told him that all you have to do is use the power of positive thinker echt use the idealized thinking yeah the law of attraction all that shit and what happens when you read enough books about it it's written enough you you see enough books written you start to go this must be this this is a truth you
