four three two one yes and we're live you know he's always wonder when I see a dude with an Android people get who gets so into teams right yes so into like groups you belong to like always an Android guy yeah what does that mean about it uses a Windows Phone this contrary yeah yeah yeah I'm trying to be outside the box yeah he's got a Henry Rollins for president sure down what's he trying to do this Henry Rollins really run from how do you know if Henry Rollins gets a part of this merchandise mostly yeah yeah I feel a little bad about that foot yeah I don't think he gives a shit no I don't think you live shit but I did buy it sort of excitedly and then had a motive like wait a minute so yeah yeah I don't even think he probably knows no I would I would imagine he may maybe you'll find out now but uh how much have you paid attention that guy I was a big fan of Henry Rollins I'm a bit like Henry Rollins is one of the episodes before one of the really gave me the curse starting to stand up really absolutely I was hauling I used to go to his spoken word shows I'm all in on here oh wow did you hear his podcast with Ari Shaffir no I haven't heard that do you gotta listen to it he um he and Ari met at Edinburgh at the Fringe Festival yeah and they were talking about travel Henry just picked spot on the map yeah he just like he goes okay Myanmar it's let's do this and he has his travel agent organize it he doesn't go with anybody he goes by himself yeah brings a laptop and a camera and some clothes when I was I've actually met him I better come back when I really met him finally he came to my book tour in LA with his assistant Heidi and he was going on a trip don't say that can't say assistant she gets pissed oh she's his manager his manager called me the assistant I mean as a person who has an assistant it's not really good word it makes it sound like you're saying like you know it doesn't sound with what the person does yeah they keep your shit organized she's a manager yeah yes his manager Heidi was there and he was leaving the next day and he didn't know where he was going she she told him you need to get out of town I'm tired of you booked him a trip and he had no ID Wayne's like yeah I don't know where I'm going I don't know going he does it all the time yeah and he just writes it was there any rights I mean he's living that the life that as an artist I would like to live if I wasn't married with two kids so yeah I've always lived even before I had was wearing two kids like I can't live that life but yeah yeah I can't do that either but he does it well Ari Shaffir said all right motherfucker you think that's strong I'm gonna go for four months so Ari went for four months all throughout Asia it brought no phone no laptop no nothing completely lost contact with everybody didn't tell anybody he knew no agent no manager told them all I'm gone for like three months and he wound up being four was he lost for the last month I did not to come back yet and it just did whatever he has his Comedy Central show and then he just decided look I'm gonna take some time off and I'm just gonna go I mean yeah that sounds great it does right yes it sounds amazing but you know I there's a lot of negotiating I have to do to get away for a weekend you know I got a plan out like to watch my worth of McGregor I to tell my wife weeks in advance that night yeah it's like I was like you could watch it with me which he did but we I can't be responsible putting the kids to bed I am yeah I did like you know spread that out make sure and then remind and like put it do not book and all those things yeah yeah for three hours getting time away when you have responsibilities it's like the more things get complicated around you like the Betty it's like biggie more money more problems yeah you know I mean it really hits and you get a lot of money then it's all a lot less problems I don't know about that man I think you still have tons of problems a few but you could I I don't I believe at that point you can sort of create your own problems if you want to have tons of problems but there are people who have a lot of money I got Zack Taylor up there's somebody else I'm a big fan of Rage Against the Machine right that dude like made his rage against machine money and it's just peaced out like you know here's a different cat that's what me but I like he's sort of like I mean I'm not saying their problems but Tom Morello Pratt has more problems he's trying to like I'm starting a band with Chuck D and the guy from Cypress Hill and I'm also intern with the E Street Band like that's a lot of problems yeah where's acts like every if you every night again I'll go out great against machine and pick up that big check other than that I'm going back to LA I mean you know so for me there's a level of money you can get where you can sort of just turn the volume way the guy from Calvin and Hobbes is another dude like you know the converse of Calvin and Hobbes was my biggest comic strip in it like at that time people loved it people worshipped it and it was some point after ten years like I'm done and hasn't been seen since that's a good move if you could pull it off that's my that's my goal my goal my goal is to get to that place of like there's something I don't know what the number is but I feel like if there's some number where you go okay that's the number where I can put it in the thing and and the in the index things and they sits there just and I yeah I'll be going stockpile and then disconnect good luck everybody yeah and maybe still like the thing is every doubt again you sort of pop up to go ahead but but I don't I don't have the need for the attention part of it it's like you know I like the work I do it I want to do the work I like to do but I don't have any need for the star part of it yeah yeah that's that becomes real probably you way better off with the resources but no star yeah you just go to the mall nobody fucks it's like the like the guy next to Oprah who nobody knows there's also another guy some white guy who's like yeah maybe he's the assistant or the manager I don't know if the name is but yeah there's these people who are like you go do the thing I'll be here yeah well that's a good move if you're like if it's Oprah because Oprah is such a huge figure that nobody's paying attention to you they're so focused on her if you're two steps behind you're good yeah yeah no it's it's real I'm project ever can actually met Oprah for this thing and if there's a whole team of people who are like it's like like 40 year old white women who feel like they're in like the the Israeli army like like we will take you down if we need to yeah oh yeah and then Oprah floats of the room like this happy beam of light and they're like the ones who are like no we'll take care of it that's the problem but you got to be intense if you're around a person like that imagine how many people are trying to grab at Oprah I mean I'm sure you get crazy like requests yeah bullshit all day imagine what it is to the Oprah I can't ya see and that's the way I see if I got to Oprah's level and she's like I mean she's doing great work she's the own there's like she's helping bring other people he's starting how would you after that if I'd done that show I'd be like good luck everybody yeah yeah I mean I yeah I don't you know I'm I don't have that level of like trying to be in the thing she's got so much power she kept dr. oz on TV after they brought him in the Congress weight loss yeah dr. Phil still has a show that she's making money off of but dr. Phil never had like a scandal no no I just feel like he's quietly like yeah it's like it's not like it's he was a big deal at one Riley right now he's like he's still like eternally still on yeah and she's any synergic you know yeah yeah if you're like a housewife and you're sitting at home and you know you want to find out what's wrong with a teenage kid yeah Oprah got sued by meat United mean like you and she was on her show and she said I'm not gonna eat meat anymore because of red meat and it was a whole thing the other day it was a there was some sort of like hey I was a court case yeah did she say something about show she basically must have been about a particular company but she said something about not eating red meat anymore this is back in the 90s and then I think that's how she met dr. Phil because he was like a jury consultant that's all I know too much huh yeah interesting Oprah Winfrey versus the beef people in 98 President George Bush Wow I do not like broccoli I have not liked it since um well this is all different people things say yeah this is an audio story that you can listen to but there's everything interesting yeah so she got sued about beat who fucks her some meat corporation in Texas because she had chicks had to move her show to Texas oh because she was like testifying yes yeah what it was that she sang something on the show about like I don't think I'll eat meat anymore or something how come you can't say that like I'm not quoting her directly but it was something about it was the Mad Cow blah Oh was that it mmm veggie libel laws I was at least some weird shit they only have in Texas probably either part of Texas only yes move our whole show to Texas oh shit about late meanwhile have you watched I posted a YouTube video on Twitter earlier today that shows the contrast between what Houston used to look like versus what it looks like now holy shit it's still raining there too it's still raining there that's the thing people to understand my family's from Alabama so I know how hurricanes work the hurricane hits that's bad because it knocks things down and knocks buildings over but then the water rises so that's when it gets that's the most the damage done it's done from the flood that happens after the hurricane yeah flood and then mold and fungus like a lot of times you have to destroy houses just because they get ate up with black mold like look at the beginning if you go bring it to the beginning Jamie and it'll show what Houston used to look like like look at this so you can see the river and now look at this and then it keeps going this is fucking insane it's insane and just remember Houston is the city that many Hurricane Katrina survivors from New Orleans went to yeah so if you're and some of them couldn't go back because New Orlean Orleans never got rebuilt in a lot of ways and so there's people in Houston right now who moved there because of Hurricane Katrina and this happens why I remember I went to Houston like six months after Hurricane Katrina and there was a ton of like people that were that had to move that we stuck there that were like piled up together in houses like many families in small houses yeah do you hear that Joel Osteen thing he lives in a basketball arena like it he doesn't live in there but his church is the old Houston Rockets basketball yeah and it's elevated yeah and yeah it's got 16,000 room for like 16 to 18,000 people in there won't bring people and now he has got Internet shame yeah sometimes it works who are these the people that are in there now that's just how big it is he bought the place where the Houston Rockets used to I mean the church is in a basketball arena that and it's all about the prosperity gospel but he put up a link to donate money for the flood that went to him it wasn't the Red Cross yeah he was like after he got internation the first time he put up a link donate money for the flood relief here and it was just a link on his website it was just a donate to the way to his church oh he's so sketchy yeah so sketchy man when you're making billions of I mean how much she's making so you're making that much money for the Lord and also tax-free tax-free that's the thing that's right oh that's horrific yeah so he's making twice the money but people have that level of come on that's so scary yeah well that's like when you found out the Scientology doesn't have to pay taxes she's like wait what well it's all I mean you know it's all that like it you should air you know yeah they're not taking paying taxes me any sense no it's it's completely sketchy there it is that is uh his his page yeah that's on his website yeah yeah give now to him yeah and you know I'm gonna take a little piece yeah well I got a overhead I can't man I got website handle him I got a manager and in this electricity internet connections to get this page built I'd have somebody do this page yeah look to me that was so like just I mean just so tone deaf to send out thoughts and prayers dude you have money you got a fuckload of money and it all comes from preaching the word so yeah so you first send out that link and then people said no and then he said it and now the doors are open and now they're taking that yeah like what's doors are open we are receiving anyone who needs shelter and let's be clear there was apparently somebody tweeted out that there was like all the mosques in Houston had opened their doors already and we're talking yeah so you know America oh those guys just too much money involved when you say like does Joe owns teams you must drive like some crazy car too right yeah Frank skrah has many crazy find out what Joel Olsteen drives I want to know what he drives I kind of guarantee you it's not even a Cadillac right it's probably like some ridiculous Bentley something stupid with like a a golden cross okay well that's the prosperity gospel if the preachers rich then we're all rich that's the is that what he's preaching that it's called the prosperity gospel and it's not just him there's several southern evangelical preachers called the prosperity ministry where you preach that if I do well then you're doing well through me oh yeah and you'll eventually eventually you'll do well eventually it'll come to you but it's about it but why would you want the preacher to look bad if because the preacher is the representative of God yeah I saw one where this guy was talking about people that have no money that if you have no money if you donate whatever you can even if you have no money the Lord will pay you back ten yeah that's that's exactly the thing that's exactly so yeah it's totally ruthless in it and those you know of course those people end up falling for scared their scandal GTI or the Tammy Faye Bakker yeah Jim Baker yeah it's just so ruthless to go after people flow dollar creepy love dollars awesome it's got like hot dogs in the back of his neck rolls my favorite is Robert Tilden the guy who talks in tongues oh yeah really said this once he goes every time you write a check to me Satan gets a black eye did you find a car for Joel Osteen he must have some half attic bomber vehicles that I can try to find a better like official but these Ferraris are coming up no they officially his it doesn't like he's not in it yeah there you go he lives in River Oaks in Houston yeah that's his house down on the left the way these know if that's really him or not it's too small and it doesn't oh yeah don't worry about it forget it crack the history nitpicky yeah no II Joel was doing fine if he doesn't own a car if he's still doing fine yeah he's managed to rake up ungodly sums of money and do so without too much scandal no no yeah no he's there but the money should be the scandal you know like I think that's the the fact that you know and it's because you know the whole god thing is caught up in our government so all there's people in our government who feel like yeah he's doing that this helps me out you know I can't I can't be mad at him because I'm trying to be like him I think I had happened during the Reagan administration that's when they first started bringing in those right-wing evangelical people and and making them a part of the Republican Party and a part of the campaigns those people all claim to have like a people who follow them so you want them you want them to support you and so yeah and they will ya they and they will like loyally it's a very creepy situation because it's if you can tap into that market know it is a market it really really clearly is I mean it's nothing more than that because if they had real integrity they would leave it out yeah and they you know they wouldn't go after those people and try to use those people to win I don't know these people are doing God's work let's just help them and prop them up and leave them alone no no no yeah they're a pawn they're a pawn in this whole little silly game yeah this game that's got ridiculous like where do we where are we right now like what now the e of your show your CNN show I mean you're on CNN so you're like do you get on fake news yeah do you get that do you get people claiming that you're part of fake news yeah I mean yes but not any I mean just like I've I'm caught up in the storm like you know it's not like it doesn't always come to me but somebody was like yeah I did something I was like another CNN fake news journalist and I was like hold on I'm not a journalist I'm taking fake news part but I'm not actually a journalist and I'm comedian stupid yeah yeah so I mean I get caught up in it but I think yeah I mean but it's not I don't it's not coming mean the way it's come to other people but I did I mean the bigger thing for me is that when I took the job at CNN is that a lot of cuz I live in the Bay Area so a lot I was like what are my friends gonna think you know CNN is not as much as the right ones to say they're the liberal news media to my friends they're not the liberal news media you know so what is it to your friends I'm very middle-of-the-road probably leaning to the right CNN leans to the right yeah yes yeah fuck are you hanging out with the bay area man I was out there on Sunday in the rally what's the point of that I went out there with my face look at that look at this celebrity star who showed up at the rally yeah yeah yeah no yeah so because I you know I know the people who started black lives matter I know the people who yes they don't look at CNN go this is the liberal news media you know isn't that funny mmm it's all perspective right yeah and I'm not there are lots of perspectives at CNN and CNN doesn't tell me to make it they don't tell me to do anything either what I'm doing I'm to be clear about that but I'm saying the perception from people I think it's funny like some people see it as the liberal news media and then I have friends who see it as as maybe the center but definitely but also or leading to the left or anything to the right and I'm just like well you know I'm in there I'm not doing anything different because I'm there well you have a different perspective also because you have essentially an entertainment show yes same as Anthony Bourdain right essentially an entertainment did every Bourdain show made my show possible that I would be there without anything for day well really jeff zucker sucker is a brilliant guy and i was working under him when I was doing Fear Factor oh yeah yeah yeah I got to meet him is very very smart guy and that was a brilliant move to have things other than these shows that just continually show over and over again the collusion with Russia the collusion with Russia all right now the Russia see or like now it's just like the Houston over knows yes like you know exact look at this look at this rain over and over again yeah and any time do your show that's one thing though being on a news network anytime some shit goes down they will bump your show like if I record your show yeah and I'll go too we've been people think we've been but more than we have what Sunday nights is the best night to be on the news cuz they news things don't happen but we've been bumped for the Orlando shooter which our episode was in Florida that week I was like yeah let's take us off the air like what it's not a you know I don't want to be looking like look at how fun it is in Florida we did a Spring Break episode it's like that's not no and then we got bumped the last episode of the season got bump the camera hi Russia I don't know what it's for but yeah so we've been bumped twice but the people who really hit it like the history of comedy was on CNN on Thursdays don't be on Thursdays Thursday's been 30 yeah cuz Thursday's the world is happening Trump is tweeting you know right things are going on and there and people are more likely to pay attention to breaking news on the Thursday than the Sunday like it doesn't have to be you know there's people are still Keaton what's happening today whereas on Sunday we're all sort of like take a break I think a lot of people thought that when Trump got into office he would stop with all the insult tweets and stuff with all the stuff that made him a popular person yeah and then all of a sudden it went from being like something that like look at this guy he doesn't give a fuck look at him he's running for president man he's gonna win yeah I think he's good he's our guy yeah and then also know like hey you're still doing this I mean even right now mixed all of his like sort of somewhat oak dick you know presidential style tweets about Houston right there are tweets about his enemies you know he can't even like take that let me just not enemy tweet right now you know he's still in the middle of like talking about these things meanwhile Obama did send out a tweet like hey everybody support the Red Cross yeah you know it's like that where's that tweet you know so bright well he doesn't you know Obama obviously doesn't have to do anything you know everything he does could be completely from his own thoughts and he doesn't he doesn't have an agenda yeah but I think that I mean again I get I know people who are like maybe it's time to have some thoughts in agenda as we're sort of in a you know Obama yeah yeah yeah like there's a I read an article that said I didn't read the article with the headline said some be honest about this Obama the the thought is that he's gonna come back in the fall to help rebuild the Democratic Party and I feel like we don't know we're gonna be here in the fall you know why are you waiting what's gonna why aren't you here that you why why put that off like things are happening now you know yeah now I get he's playing like that Star Trek chest where's three levels and things are happening and he's seeing things I can't see and he sees the matrix but I feel like I'd like to see you before the fall even though the fall is only like two weeks away what could he do other than you know got a lot of money alright something has access to a lot of money for sure which means you have a lot of it he still has a lot of influence you know so I don't know what I don't know what he could do what he could do there's he could do something you know I think that you know even if you just responded to every Donald Trump tweeted be like yeah like I think there's there's there's he's a massing power for something and maybe he's got some plan that I'll be like oh my god you know but it's like he certainly is you know he's still one of the most influential people on the planet yeah when you talk about like that three level chess thing or multi-level testing you got a wonder like at what point in time does a some sort of a candidate from the Democratic Party arrive like like where are they and who are they and are they think you mean is it Gavin Newsom is it you know who is it I mean I hope it's I mean here's I I guess I'm a I always say this I if I think my party affiliation is Democrat but I'm not somebody who's like reppin the Democratic Party I don't is people sometimes think I am just because I'm against Donald Trump but uh uh so I would say this that I hope that that person is somebody whose name we don't even know yet because I feel like the thing that happened with Obama is he came out of nowhere and I think if you go to the usual suspects with the way the current series current setup you do if the electoral college is still in place in four years then then we're doomed if we go the usual suspects well Obama might have come out of nowhere but a lot of people were looking at him like this guy here you got this guy Harvard educated very articulate good-looking smoothly mom Lina's Joe Biden said it was he was calm like that was the most when you look at the way Trump has been responding to all these things how he freaks out when he gets a small crowd in Arizona at a press conference I mean the the thing about Obama that stands out more than anything was his composure yeah he fell like the adult in the room yeah whether you agreed with him or not necessarily didn't agree with everything he did he felt like a grown-up who's making thoughtful adult decisions that's something that disagreed with but I knew he had thought them through well and also one of the most important things about being a president is the president sort of sets the tone for the rest of the country like he represents the country now when the president represents the country and he's talking shit about people bleeding from plastic surgery and you know fake news and yelling about this and then saying things that are just absolutely not true yeah it turn out to not be true and it's like and you have to like look at it and you vet it out and you go always fucking lying like what and all the associated and with people with known conspiracy theorists and you know and white supremacist and you know I came to me it's like the you're again you're saying you're setting the tone for the country and all those people feel certainly emboldened by him and empowered by him in a way that like is not healthy for the country well even if he doesn't support them that whole wink and a nod I'm saying that's very sketchy you most of you know we know communication is nonverbal yeah so the fact that he doesn't even if it sounds like he's saying the right thing if it's not landing with the people he's talking about the right way like if he says you know I support the blacks or whatever it is it's like if he doesn't feel like that to the blacks then it's not that doesn't mean anything well people know when you're saying something from the heart versus when you're saying something for damage control like charlottesville like when he came out of to Charlottesville and said that people were behaving badly on all sides on all sides did you got out not see that ran over a crowd of protesters he hit the gas and ran over other white people you dumb fuck this this is so crazy so to say on all sides this is so crazy yeah and he improvised that part that was not in the speech he that was his riff all signed because that was I think it had been written for him and he was like you know I can't I got I got to put some magic in here well I am of the belief that non-violence is always the answer and that running around with masks on hitting people with by clocks when showing up with sticks and bats and the the shit that people are trying to do I think although their heart and their mind might be in the right place when you show up with with bulletproof vests on and helmets and sticks people see that and that is an act of aggression and the opposition is going to show up in turn with something similar or worse it escalates well I think the problem is is that I was in Berkeley I said in the weekend at the no hate in the bay rally that was supposed to that you know that whoever said they were gonna show up all right people I don't they're also renamed white supremacist right they were going to show up like 4,000 people showed up by you know somewhere between three three and four thousand people on which side mostly on the side of not that not the old right so four thousand all told yeah yeah yeah but it was like the the the side he was like not in our streets this is Berkeley we don't play this shit right was way over was way bigger than the than aside from the white supremacy all right side it was not even close as it was in Boston right yeah yeah yeah so and the and overwhelmingly there was like 13 arrests and as many people pointed out there's more arrests of the Raiders game you know like it's not that's not a lot of rest and sometimes you get arrested because they're like Lissa's get you the fuck out of here or this is this is a safety issue or you know so it's like 13 arrests some people were injured no deaths thankfully but if you look at the all the mainstream news reports it's like it focuses on those people who the ante for the people who were the black bloc anarchists who were there to like fight with people well and and for P I was there there was old people there there was young people there there was I had a friend who was like yeah I got an alert on my phone that said that uh that there was a tear gas and I was in the rally like there's tear gas like he's in the middle of the rally CNN or the SAMS to chronicles like there's two guys in Berkeley and he's like there is and all that stuff got played over played and I was there my wife was there and it was a it was a very beautiful day despite the despite the reason why the day come together well there's a real problem and that the media needs something to bleed they need some tear gas yes they need a riot in order to get clicks it's just like that New York Times article that I talked about with the Conor McGregor's face being completely bloodied and fallen oh that's yeah doing that because you're trying to sell newspapers not because that's what happened and you haven't hired anybody they're on staff who actually knows the UFC or knows boxing or knows combat sport it's like that's to me it's like we need an article about this well and also having someone with a perspective that would go to that rally and say look how many people were here that believe in equality that believe in unity that believe in peace that just want to support this idea that the community is filled with way more of those people yeah and the people with the bike locks and the face masks and it so you're talking about a few scrambled individual people you know and here's the thing about those people they don't show up when it's just a beautiful day at the park right like you know nobody I live in Berkeley nobody's like walking through Berkeley oh god is antifa about to show up to the farmers market like they don't show up unless the shit hits unless they feel like the shit is hitting the fan well I what concerns me is that those people when they're wearing the bike masks or the the masks and the fucking vests and the kneepads and all the shit that's where you get those assholes in Charlotte that showed up with guns mm-hmm like those guys that were open carrying and Charlotte with bulletproof vests on walking on the street showing trigger discipline with their finger on the outside of the gun was like how the fuck is this allowed and dressed in many of them just in military garb so they looked like they were part of the military or like they were part of law enforcement so you know like that was the real problem too is people thought they were poor some people were confused and thought they were on there like they were part of law enforcement yeah I think the thing the thing about NP fo I would say this too is that the reason why NT fit even has a room to exist is because people in those communities don't think they can count on the police you know it's cuz there were two other like you know protests in Berkeley that's that it erupted in violence cuz the police were standing by watching it happen right they didn't go in and break it up and that it certainly happened in Charlottesville too that's what's been said in know if this is true but it's been said that the police were instructed in Berkeley to engage with the anarchists yeah I don't know how that works I know the mayor Berkley I don't but I know and then I heard found that recently that the mayor of Berkeley isn't actually in charge of the police which I'm like didn't what's the point of being the mayor was in charge the Chiefs I guess the chief was inter I don't I had never heard of that before Nadeau Greene told me that like they he talked to the mayor he's like I'm not actually in charge the police and I'm like did well then why are we listening to you the boss because how the fuck could the mayor have enough time to be paying attention to every single issue that the police have to deal with when he's dealing with every single issue the mayor has to deal with the president is in charge of the military sort of but he sorts one of the things that the president has done is sort of given the power to the generals and that's one of the things that the military really enjoys about Trump yeah as opposed to any other presidents they feel like the handcuffs are off yeah but I think that at the end of the day the president can you know can consult with if he tells the generals go do this thing they have right you know so I feel like that's that's the kind of I don't I don't I don't I mean I think the president has too much power the president is you know many people have reported can launch nukes if he wants to right now it would have somebody would have to like violate his order to not launch the nukes so I think there's too much power there but I do think it's weird that the person you elect to lead the city isn't in charge of the law of law enforcement well as soon as he pardoned Joe Arpaio yeah that's when everybody went wait there's no I mean there's no serious debate the problem is now we have debate about things that is like we're these aren't two equal sides there's not many sides there's nobody who seriously knows the law or knows or knows what jurors history who believes he did was not guilty of those things he bragged about the things in profiling people and bragged about abusing people so there's nobody to about people dying in his prison yeah because they they had heat stroke yes I mean they couldn't get cold water these people were out in tents at 120 degrees yeah there's an article that somebody wrote in the this kid was born in Tijuana lived in Arizona and got arrested for drunk driving and spent a year in those those camps you know look he was raised in America it was essentially an American even though that he was born the wrong patch of dirt for some people yes he's an American he just got arrested for drunk driving and did a year in this tent and was talking about how people died around him yeah and talking about the food that they ate and how ruthless that can and you know some people have this this opinion of like hey well then don't break the law but that that is a goddamn convenient way to look at it and not it's just not very humane and not very and not what we're supposed to be in this country I mean we're not supposed to be a country that is that is that punitive with the law we often are and also we know the one thing we know about America is that the law is not equally applied to everybody so you know over a rich guy rich white guy drunk drives he's not going to prison for a year you know which rich white guys in jail unfortunately was through everybody was it in that prison was he going to the outside hot prison he threw a lot of people in that hot prison and he's a cunt I was talking nationally yeah yeah but all right yeah that the law is not applied equally to everyone you know that we know that if you have money and privilege you can get out of situations but that other people don't have all the money and privilege can't get out of well sure I know comedians that have been arrested in LA for a drunk driver and they never did a day in jail yeah you know in this one kid who is born in Tijuana does a year in a tent yeah you know it's I mean look you shouldn't drunk drive no yeah that's clever yeah you should be you should if you break the law there should be repercussions especially because you don't have control of your body and you're driving a deadly vehicle and you could crash into a family look there's a lot of real real issues we have the law like I mean like I did we did an episode United States in the first season about saying Clinton about lifers in prison and same Clinton and I talked to a lot of guys first of all none of the guys I talked to said they didn't do it everybody I was like yeah I did it you'll see the thing I did but when you heard what they did a lot of times you're like is that life in prison what I get like what there's a guy who was convicted of robbing two banks now he he that's bad let's say that's bad definitely minute nobody died nobody got hurt certainly people were traumatized by the fact you robbed the bank he didn't even have a gun he did the things you can rob a bank but you're saying give me the money I have a bomb you know whatever right so but didn't have any weapons anything like that now that's bad but he's like he's probably in 60s now and I met him and he's one of the coolest people I've met he's a leader in prison he's one of the guys who like runs the newspaper and he invited me he's like he talked to my agent like you're coming back in September to speak to the guys like he's he's a total leader and he's in prison for life for the rest of his life not joe arpaio yeah directly responsible for people being dead yes yeah there's a ton of people that have mysteriously died inside that guy's prisons yeah and and that's that's the part about me it's like there's these this is not the same scales of justice we're talking about and you know there's a guy who got a third strike in California he's no California third strike law that happened for firing a gun in the air that's bad but that ended up with him getting life in prison and you're just like it's bad it's bad it's not I feel like I have to say that enough I'm not saying let every every inmate out but I'm saying it's bad but life in prison well the idea that you can never reform people yeah that's that seems insane and yeah well I guess there's the other perspective is where the resources going to come from to actually reform some and how much effort does it take and individual cases are different and some people really are just habitual criminals and there's nothing you could do about it and if you do release them and they continue to do in a crime or they hurt somebody that they didn't have to like where does the burden lie there but I you know I think Norway I believe is the country Jamie let's look it up that the longest prison prison census you can get is 20 years prisoners live in like one-bedroom apartments like they you know they have TV they have and the whole thing is like and this is San Quentin as this - there's rehab programs I talk to inmates who said the and then after 20 years in Norway they talk to you and go are you ready to go back outside like they don't let you out automatically but they sort of check back in with you and so if you're not like the guy who shot up the those people in Norway he's probably gonna get out again right but the whole idea is that yeah small percentage of prisoners served more than 14 years Wow yeah but but the thing is they're in there like like in San Quentin I talked to inmates who said in most California prisons the rehab programs are AAA and Jesus like that's all they have is Jesus just the pathway to Jesus but in San Quentin there's a newspaper there's there's uh there's there's a restorative justice programs there's a like a you know there's just a plate that you can learn how to code like there's a prisoners who learn how to code right now so that when you come out there's a sense of like I have there's lots of other programs I can't even think of it but there's also there's yoga in San Quentin because the Bay and so there's all these things in the so that when you come out you are a more fully formed human being so that you have you have job skills you've done restorative justice programs you've helped other inmates who came in to do restorative justice programs so when you come out it's not that it's easy to get pretty to be paroled from prison you know but when you come out you were more prepared for the world as opposed to guys in other prisons in California who get out who have just been like doing rehab in Jesus and have no way to interact with the world yeah and just feel like they've just been punished like being isolated and locked in caged and as a lot of those guys say they go in there for one crime that's not a big deal and they learn how to be better and better criminals in prison but you have to sort of like California has like levels of prison I think level 4 is the worst and like maybe level 5 but anyway so everybody sort of starts out at level 4 so if you like are in prison in California for something you know that you know shooting a gun in the air you're at a level you're there with murderers yeah and then you have to survive that and hopefully graduate the san quintin but if you're in there with murderers you have to survive that and so a lot of guys become bigger badder criminals because they're surrounded by bigger badder criminals just to put on armor yeah just just to get through the day and so to me like the whole I mean you know the the you know and there's a lot of money that's already in prisons that's not being usable the prison you know private prison system like we are selling private companies are selling like they have to keep the prisons full because they're running a prison for profit so it becomes less about like it's like we need to keep the man full you know it's not about like rehab and rehabilitation it's about we need to keep the beds full because we are running we are a corporation running for profit that's where it gets dark the fuck did anybody ever approve that it's basically they're using humans as like cells and a battery yeah like a giant battery that generates income yeah exactly and that the prisoner if the goal is not to turn these guys into better citizen the citizens the goal is to keep the men and women the goal is to keep the prisons filled well it's absolutely been proven by prison guard unions trying to they mean they lobby against marijuana legalization yeah marijuana which is probably the one thing that's gonna stop people from committing crimes yeah I mean you're talking about violent crimes if there is a drug that's gonna stop you from doing a violent crime that might be it or at least it may be like lessen the chance yes maybe I should sit down and just chill out for a second before I go do that thing yeah there's no other reason to lobby against it you want to keep your job you want to make sure that you have plenty of jobs the people in your Union yeah and their and those and as many of those people who are in prison for nonviolent drug offenses like marijuana other things who are there next to next to murderers yeah you know look you don't have to figure out how to navigate through that in there in if you're not insane Clinton you're not you're not in a place where you can learn other skills we I mean you know again guys isn't Clinton getting college diplomas getting like all sorts of certificates and things but the problem is is that nobody then wants to release them from prison right you take that chance nobody when nobody wants to go you know no politician goes I have released more inmates from takes is one Willie Horton right yeah which you know and that was like you know we're again we're demonizing like one case closed same thing with Berkeley there's a picture that was on the exams people chronicle of a never antifungals ante for black black areas I don't know like with like with like a like a gas bomb and surrounding that person is journalists taking pictures of him mm-hmm so that's yeah that becomes the face it's like they're not surrounded by other black bloc people right it's like all the journals ago that's where the picture is yeah you know not like the people who are like I was in a truck with clergy singing like spirituals nobody took pictures of that and put it on the news anyway I think that ended yeah local public radio station because I'm a celebrity I was in the back of the truck well anytime there's like some sort of a gathering you're always gonna have people in that gathering that act out try to get more attention than they deserve or that get caught up in the whole group movement like there's always this sort of like gigantic mass of people that will cause people to behave some people to behave in a way that's uncharacteristic or and I mean there's just that mob mentality yeah thing that happens it like you know rock concerts or anything yeah yeah mentality is 100% real you can feel it in the air which shit's going sideways I mean it happens every night but you've been in clubs where it's like you know something happens like a heckler or something that energy changes and there's that moment like what's about to happen it feels like any and you also been in that position I'm sure you have where you feel like I have a lot of power in this moment like I could if I if you said you certainly if you said get them people would get them you know I mean if I said Gaeta maybe like I will write my congressman right we should start a petition you know but that's and that's that's real that's a you know and I think the thing is that everybody responds differently the thing that happened I'll say specifically in Berkeley was that there's a sense that these people brought violence to Berkeley the last few times they came right and people respond differently to threats of violence some people respond with the nonviolent things some people respond to I won't go to the park that day and some people responded with fuck it bring it but don't you think there's also a real issue in you I mean you got to find out what is actual hate speech and what is like someone like Ben Shapiro who I think is just a conservative guy who's very articulate and doesn't promote hate at all and he's extremely reasonable but there's a lot of people that equate him even though he's an Orthodox Jew a lot of people equate him with being a Nazi and they try to silence him from speaking like when you do that I think it becomes a giant issue and I think you gotta let people talk and if you disagree with people I mean as long as they're not out there promoting violence or promoting negativity or promoting some sort of a you know anything that it's abhorrent but if you if you let someone talk and then if you have someone that disagrees with them have a debate well I think debate didn't have everybody like the peaceful and civil with each other I mean I think the the problem is is that the that line of what hate speeches and I just talked to someone from the ACLU my other podcast about about the hill hate speech thing what podcast politically reactive yeah it's a podcast my friend Hari Kondabolu it's a weekly talk about politics we were gonna do it we started it right before the election like will do this political podcast and Hillary will win they will go about our business that was a big year that was the deal we were off or do it up until the election and then it was like oh I guess we're doing this for them you may be forever yeah maybe through the end of time so it becomes like Putin yeah exact you know although then I guess I stay employed I don't know this rock was on stage right after the election he goes you know he's never getting out of there you know that right was gonna be there forever he scared the shit out of me because I've never thought about that I mean you know I bloomberg stayed in New York an extra term just cuz he wanted to you know New Yorkers just yeah New York Mayor supposed to be two terms and out and he was like it was I forgot it was but it was like he was like and they let him yeah I didn't live in yoga the time so I don't know how it all went down did they change the law I think he changed the law I don't know if you change permanently but yeah yeah so if there is a precedence for this as all I'm saying there's a presence for some sort of like the country needs me because it's so divided yeah motherfucker cuz you divide a bit this is how the game works so I would say the thing about Ben Shapiro and I don't I've only seen a little bit of his work but I certainly I know there are people on that side who it's an ideological argument and ideological arguments sometimes can't be filled with hate so I'm not I don't know ben shapiro so that's that sometimes it's like well yeah it's just you're just making an ideological argument but it ends with me having to move out of america you know so that's yeah but i'm saying so but you know that some people make these i yes I'm not saying him but the problem is is that now there's a whole movement associated with things that maybe been it looks to be a part of so that if he shows up people don't know and don't know that he's not that he shows up going I'm not bringing violence but they're not babe maybe violence traveling around with him it's not him but there are others like him or less less reasonable like all right like whatever the fuck all right is i right what the fuck it is what's that Tifa right and what is that I mean I mean there's some people that are on that that are violent and there's people that are that consider themselves anti-fascist that are extremely peaceful yes so like and they would say that they're an T for the real antiva and then what is black bloc is that that's Monica so that's what I think it's probably area I don't know I but it's a thing that like whenever we would see I think now we're calling it a antifa but like there would be I mean this happened the there were some black lives matter protest in Berkeley and some black bloc Danica it's described the same way wearing black I'll cut all covered up and they were like and these people showed up so I don't know if they were in T food were like great now we can loot and people stood in front of going no no we're not we're not doing that we're not we're not doing that you don't sauces had nothing getting into the Verizon store to do with you ransacking this RadioShack I saw some of the ante for people trying to stop one of the other nt4 people from beating up a trump supporter they had this guy down and well that was a journalist a Letson that's a yeah he's a trip very journalist he has the podcast revealed and he's the guy that tried to stop him yeah yeah black guy black guy waded through the white people well there's white people that I saw doing it too so it must have been like some sort of a it must be certainly it had been more than yes certainly there are people who are like there's tot there's people who support on TV because they feel like well we need somebody who stands up to this but there's not people who support people beating people up randomly so yes there was Alexson and other people stepped in to like yeah we're not do thing about the Berkeley in the barriers that people don't get they think it's all one thing like that it's all some sort of like lefty like socialist blah blah blah and the thing about Berkeley is it's not that the barrier is not that it's a lot of different people who feel like who are on some version of the left but they don't honestly agree with each other and they let a lot of shit go like it's not like that you know so that can be the naked guy who walks through town like that does mean we all support people walk around naked or like right at me but it also means that like during Obama's reign in the ballot in San Francisco they were libertarian set up on corners with Obama big huge pictures of Obama and with Hitler mustaches painted on it and we're all like huh do your thing man and that's what people don't get who put this whole lefty sort of whatever Lib tard thing on Berkeley it's not one thing it's not right it's where it's a lot of things that the barriers is it's where all the freaks are to end up with like I don't feel in my life that I'm understood but we don't agree with each other right the thing that we sort of all agree on his eye you can so if the alt-right wanted to show up you know conservative people come speak at Berkeley all the time it's specifically around people who look like they're bringing violence or bringing targeting people that's the problem the birth at UC Berkeley and one of the professor's is I think of law there his name's John you why oh oh he wrote the Bush torture memos he's a professor at UC Berkeley nobody's like who you got I guess he's a good professor you know I mean what is he a professor in law he's a law professor he's been there for a long time and he's he wrote the bush torture memos that said you know if you do some waterboarding this is not a direct quote it looks like but he wrote the like memos it said like that it's sort of outlined how did you enhanced interrogation techniques he's been there for a long time you know my thinking about him you know jokes I've never met him I've never socialized with him but man he's there and also um the dude who was a like it deep in the Clinton White House a kid named his name but yeah there's also at Berkeley like there's not some sort of lefty version of Berkeley that is one thing it's a lot of different thing the free speech thing is true the thing that people are nervous about is violence yeah so I think that you know Ann Coulter can come speak at Berkeley anytime she wants to if the if if there's this thing about like there's not going I'm not going to encourage violence here's the issue with Ann Coulter I think Ann Coulter is an opportunist and you think that what she does is try to inflame people so that she can sell books and stay relevant it's a great so it's she's actually going after the market like we were talking about earlier she saw this market out there's like huh I'm a pretty blonde lady she's know what at some point I'm a black guy I can't see what are you seeing I feel like early in her career she was marketed that way I'm not trying to say there's a lot of those out there I don't think she's one of okay well that expert but please do yeah I'm a blonde lady yeah that is like that that this in this package this becomes with it's the same way that like it's comics you go oh you're the guy who does this you know yeah so she's doing it I mean there's people that do that online that you they're saying things that are inflammatory they're saying things they don't you don't know they don't necessarily if they're being completely objective and reasonable they wouldn't say that you're only saying it because they think it's gonna get a reaction which is why her and Bill Maher get along together because they're both doing the same thing I can't deal with that I just don't have enough time kind of time in the world you should get attention for what you deserve attention for and if you want attention by being provocative and in Chile unless you're funny yeah that's comments the nation of comedy hail if you're not funny fucker yeah yeah no it's absolutely true I think she thinks she's funny but I think these Berkeley has had conservative speakers speak their throughout the history of Berkeley it's not about that but history is different than the current the current the current thing is because when when Miley was gonna show up he there was a there was the fear and he'd seen it happened before where he was targeting students either undocumented students he like naming students during his stage thing who are undocumented or trans and there was fear like weak that's that's promoting violence that the undocumented thing is a huge issue yeah that's that's not that's specific specifically targeting individuals that and that thing is Berkeley's like we can't stand for that that's not about free speech that's about safety and I feel like that's where the where does hate speech began where does free speech begin where we're at the huge murky area that even the law can't tell you where it is and and so but those issues of what is free speech and what isn't free speech our freedom of expression you know and we get in the Bay Area I live right next to Oakland Black Panthers were in Oakland California used to be an open carry state until the Black Panthers like oh it is and they went to like Sacramento when Reagan was there and like openly caring and people like it's not really a debate right now in Charlottesville though is it yeah so it's about who's in power and what they want to let you get away with Charlottesville open-carry I mean yeah must be yeah there's no way there's no no that's definitely that mean they you know that they think they pick Charlottesville for a reason isn't that weird though it's like a liberal College what liberal art liberal arts college doesn't mean it's a liberal college but a liberal arts college a blue dot in the know this red state that is open carry so it like there's a reason they're targeting these places I think Berkeley up until recently sup felt like a soft target cuz they've been there twice and whooped our asses we're like alright we we just get to a third fight you know Mayweather I want to get McGregor you know in the Octagon Arturo my turn I get right yeah so this third time it was like we're like no well Charlottesville to me was so representative of the times that we're in because all these white guys with citronella candles they got from Home Depot it's like why in the fuck why don't you guys like carry Whole Foods back well walk around with Crocs on the tiki torches are not white inventions so it's like a whole like it's just the whole thing like you had that you couldn't even bring your own you couldn't just bring sticks you had to bring Polynesian tiki torches that's a whole torch thing like it what the fuck are we doing there why do you have torches they're invoking the images of white people carrying torches that have terrorized people of color in black but that's what it is it seems that there's no other reason for free speech thing is like it's you're purposely invoking an image because you know you could have just held your phone's up with the lights on if we were talking about those headlamps you get when you go camping those are way better than those stupid fucking torches yeah they want to look supreme that doesn't make you look supreme it's also what torches represent is fire and fire is very volatile you could use that fire you could light things on fire like we're at step one step two is we start lighting shit on fire with this fire yeah like right now we're carrying it around in a controlled manner but you're showing it's it's in a way like a step below open-carry you're walking around with something you can use to light things on fire and they know the history of white people carrying torches is the Klan so there's very purposefully doing the thing I love the idea that like there's probably Klan members like dudes that's where we were the hoods we don't want to be fired that's why we wore the hoods getting fired left and right no crying but yeah I think they know the recipe of that they know the history of the fact that like if we show up carrying torches it means something different than if we show up wearing head lamps or caring our phones you couldn't even get those fuckin Frankenstein style torches with a res burn to quickly replenish those every 15 minutes yeah those because as I learn with the Klan that would burn too quickly yeah well that's also the thing with flaming arrows like people to think that you could like light an arrow and they don't they go out wind and air works feet-per-second go out it's not gonna be able to light that boat on fire get the fuck out you know they're probably rehearsal for the torch thing where they actually didn't have regular torches and they're like oh this is it yes you know Home Depot is probably like wheat yeah what are you doing you know at Home Depot managers now like how many torches they want slow down a second backyard torches like what those things with like the bamboo stalks that they're using for the bottom or whatever the fuck the stick is it's just God it's so it's so the sign of the times it's such a poser move yep it is a poser moving yet they know that if you're a black person walking through this he's just three streets of Charlottesville and you see that coming your way and you you know your thing your invoked by manages images of America's past where that was like that equal death because they weren't back then the torches were for your house you know the torches were for you they were not for they were not just showing strength and so and they know that and that's why when people go it's just free speech it's like we have to stop acting like that's that just for speech if you walk around the torch it's definitely more than that you don't have to have a torch everyone can see you it's not it's not so dark out that we can't see you especially in those in that way my wife actually the other day it was like there's a guy welcome street with a blowtorch that she it's only now because we think like what's that mean but like in the baby's a welder yeah yeah exactly she wasn't she called the cops she was just like on the phone he got organized through the torch but the idea is that that that didn't alert her because it's like is just some guy walking on the torch but it's specifically the context of nighttime a group of hundreds of white guys carrying torches walking towards people is like that not that's not free speech that's not freedom of expression and the chance there's a chance that they were yelling out that the whole thing was just so fucking bizarre it's like how did they organize like where are these guys meeting up to figure this out I feel like it's the same thing is like live-action roleplay it's like they're meeting up online and then they probably meet for the first time when they get there you know and and and I think it's also just really you know it's really it's really indicative of like these are the times we live in that they think they can get away with this and then surprise when they get fired like they think that like oh we'll just do that and then we'll go to Applebee's dude we can see you it's addictive of them being fucking stupid which is why they're doing it in the first place which is why when the president goes on both sides yeah maybe there were people and a lot of people said this maybe there were some white people yeah I do feel like that my rights are being a little bit trampled on and I really want to show up the minute you hear people chanting like all whatever the end the somatic things they were saying you gotta go home yeah well what were they saying about take it back from the Jews or stop the Jews from taking over yeah yeah and then the president go yeah the president can't come out against that well you know well he's seeing people open carry with military outfits on walking with these folks he's seen these people walking on the street with torches and he doesn't have some sort of an articulate response to that where he's saying like look ladies and down this is not being inclusive this is not this is not like stepping up and saying that what we need to do is like come to some sort of an understanding and be a peace with each other which is what America should be but yeah but you started it wrong articulate response yeah like that's not that's not his thing I mean he used to be more articulate which is really weird I don't think men should do anything when they're 70 doesn't work anymore their fucking skin is falling off their face their back starts to hurt they're cranky I just think when you get to be that age you should just shut the fuck up yeah you should you should sit down you should go fishing or something yeah but you definitely shouldn't have the kind of insane high-pressure job that by the way nobody should have nobody should be the one guy that run or the one woman who runs the whole country it's an insane responsibility I was reading about Obama oh I put a tweet up yesterday about when the Republicans were freaking out because Obama wore a tan suit yeah they do there's always this day and Obama scan yeah like in the middle of a trumpet yeah or get you like oh my god there was they were trying to find something to get mad at he was gay okay there be days when he wouldn't wear a jacket like he would just wear like a button-down shirt and the time people like you need to work like Bush's thing was he always wore W Bush always wore a full suit and Obama was like I'm still the president in his room and people gazing the things that they nitpicked and this is the things so stupid there's many people on the Left who had big huge disagreements with Obama that we weren't able to express effectively because we were too busy defending his birth certificate you know was a Trump thing yeah yeah that was a Trump thing he was ahead of that shit was the head he was certainly he like saw that thing happened and sort of stepped into it like yeah I like this spot yeah did he hire people to go investigate Joe Arpaio was a part of this he sent people though there's all these tweets reads like I just sent a team to Hawaii the things they found are it's big it's sad it's amazing and then you you know here we sit like nobody ever held him and Trump never got held into account for anything and still doesn't really get held to account for anything that he said or done what bothered you about Obama he was in office a lot of the stuff he did was business as usual president stuff like you know you know I using the military and nations and killing innocent civilians that you know that didn't need to be caught up in war you know I mean like drone shit and like yeah you know I think you know we were supposed to get out of Afghanistan oh it's his regular president shit that we said that his first you know I drank all the Obama kool-aid the first time around you know hope and change a lot of the hope and change was about not being a president as usual also I don't think he really you know the thing that Trump does really effectively the thing that george w bush did really effectively republicans do a good job of that they really know how to use the bully pulpit to really push their things through now that trump has really done anything to push things through but he knows how to be a bully from the pulpit he hasn't really passed me major legislation but obama because he was a he wanted to be an adult and he really wanted to be a unifier and i think a lot of that comes really literally from the fact that he's half black and half white that he he has existed in more than one world he didn't I felt like there was time so it's like to just you get you are an effective speaker you could really push through like single-payer health care in a way like at least the debate on it you know so we don't settle for Obamacare you know I think that there's I think that he didn't and I you know I I've never talked to the man I've never met him if I can the only black person associate with Hollywood who's never met Obama but my dad has a picture with Obama I don't mean nice to be able tell my kids what was the first black president like I have no fucking idea that he didn't that he didn't use the full force of his of his presence because he was a rock star and I feel like that that could have pushed some things through or at least got us to debate things that you know even Obama going when they asked him about marriage gay marriage he was like I've evolved on that he had nothing to do with legalizing marriage equality but the president's saying that made a lot of people go huh maybe I'm ready to evolve you know I mean but I don't think he used the full force of his of his bully pulpit in the way that I always said I wanted him to drive the presidency the way the George W Bush did like there's no rules there's no laws you feel like when someone gets in the office they realize how complex the inner workings of the federal government really are and then they just kind of abandon a lot of the ideas that they wanted to push when they got in there like I remember when Obama had that hope and change website that had all the stuff about whistleblowers and now whistleblowers are going to be protected under the Obama administration and then as soon as you got an office he was worse on whistleblowers than anybody yeah and then he removed that section of the hope and change website they deleted it after the whole you know the Edward Snowden thing and the Bradley Manning thing Chelsea Manning thing they were like fuck this you can't do that yeah I do I think usually we're not saying that with this current president but I do think that's the thing where they get in there and suddenly people go you're because as part of this you are the most powerful individual in the world but also the Train is going this way like it's already it's already left the station so you I do think that there is you're not gonna get really an ultimate revolutionary mindset in that in the president's seat you know somebody who's who's reasonable you know I mean you're not gonna get somebody who's you know you know the Alicia Garza from black lives matter is not gonna be the president as much as I think she'd be great at it because this is not gonna end up with somebody who actually has a revolutionary mindset so I think that and then so then if you start out there then when you put those people in there then they you know I don't know what the pressures of the office are sure they're amazing but it automatically lead you to capitulate you know and if you have a revolutionary mindset you mean you might be able to use that for one aspect of being the leader of the entire free world but what about all the other shit that guy has to deal with all day long there's not enough time in the day no one has enough of that Trump apparently has enough time to do out the go golfing you know like that's not doing he's not doing the stuff you know how many people aren't even appointed in the Pentagon yeah shitload of jobs at date they haven't even filled yet rightly for Trump there's extra time in the day you know but I do thinking when I want to be clear cuz you know cuz I know people listening when I say revolutionary mindset I mean single-payer healthcare is a revolutionary mindset like every American has the right to to healthcare every American has every American has the right to send their kids to good public schools that are well funded you know these are things I think that are like when I say revolutionary mindset I don't mean like setting things on fire I mean like revolutionary ideas that every person in this country deserves you know so and I think that that's those people aren't gonna be in the driver's seat of the White House well utilizing the resources that we have because of the fact that we pay taxes a tremendous amount of money goes to the federal government with very little recourse there's no there's no audit you don't get like some showers when you don't get the pic right please send this to the schools yeah what would be important you know what would be more important to fund I mean yeah I think we should all have that conversation and I just think that the way it's structured right now the amount of power that corporations have the amount of power that special interest groups have influenced the president the amount of just the sheer money in politics with lobbyists and you know there's just one community outside of Washington DC it's one of the richest communities in the world and it's all lobbyists yes yeah I mean these are just people that are using and selling influence yeah I you know I'm not people sort of call me a communist but I think I'm not a communist at all but I certainly are you anything capitalists I'm trying to make money yeah I also believe I can help put a spread a better message and help you know and use my resources to help people but I'm yeah I mean I mean in it I'm in show business like yeah you know I'm not I know activists and I know how hard they work and then I sometimes use my resources to help those people out and donate money but I'm not like I'm not I'm in show business I'm trying to you know I'm I'm in Kevin Hart's career I'm not Kevin Hart than ever and I have a lot of respect for Kevin Hart I think he's amazing but it's like I have to sort of remind myself and other people like yeah I'm not some of the people with the word activist next to my name I'm like activist is actually a job I don't have that job I mean I do I do things that are engaged in activism but I might do tax forms comedian you know what you have interests yeah I'm interest and you also have thoughts about how things can be better yeah and you use your platform to spread those thoughts yeah and I also want a bigger house you know and I think that like it's OK to do to do all those things yeah you know as for my family not just because I want to like roll around my money I want a bigger house so much so I can move my momma to it you know I there are selfish interested interest in there but you know so yeah I'm not trying to I'm not try I but I do think that this country has the level of research like there's a website it's called DonorsChoose org and I'm not trying to a commercial but it just it's a website where schools in your area you go to the website and you put it in like your zip code and you will see the school the public schools in your area that need things and it's it's sad what they need we need paper right we need like we're trying to teach the kids how to like learn how to read and we don't have any books where the fuck did that happen where did it go wrong there's so little money for schools the teachers get paid like thirty thousand dollars a year it's supposed to survive off of that and every teacher even in public at private schools but certainly public schools put their paycheck back into the school because they go the kids need we're trying to teach a you know a learning thing and we don't have the stuff and they can't afford it so every teeth every public school teacher I've ever known so use some of their check to go back into the school yeah I mean it's just like he's one of the most important things that we have they're not being making yeah they're not making yeah they're making 30,000 some of our making thirty thousand dollars a year some of them are like teachers aides who's just out of college but they have to if they don't put money into the classroom their kids will not have things and that's even private school teachers do that but they may not put as much but yeah it's every every teacher every one has to do that and we don't and we don't think that's a problem like I feel like why isn't it that I feel like there would be some way like why is it Mark Zuckerberg public school teacher getting a percentage sort of like just there should be some tax on all of us that goes back to our public school teachers if we weren't the public school even if we did but I feel like it's weird to me that like we're acting like these people come out of nowhere cuz Joel Olsteen is got all that shit piled up a yeah basketball Stadium I do think there nobody talks about like that is like hoarding money that's that's holding that sword that's hoarding but doesn't have to pay taxes you don't have to pay taxes you're fucking straight-up hoarder yeah there's no there's no cat skeletons in there but that's Annie should be like billionaire hoarding I feel like that's that's a thing you know but I mean that is literally what made the guy who created Scientology get involved in it that's that was literally the idea behind l ron Hubbard making a shitload of money created a religion best way to make money yeah yes literally his quote yeah and then you know we talked we were talking with for we got on but there's all these like you know this like religion is a good way to be funny but there's all these like motivational speaker type yeah where it's like I'm like looking like what are you well now where were you before you were this yeah Oprah's a motivational speaker yeah motivate me out what did you do right but lies people I'm like there's some people like weren't you just a comic before yeah I know a guy was a hack yeah he's a motivational speaker yeah it's like and you listen to things like yeah that sounds right but yeah who are you I don't know you know you know what what's your resume that you get to does I mean all this stuff is sound right we can all read fortune cookie here we go actual cheese what's your yeah what what put you I mean if if you for example we're like this weekend and L Aaron in Berkeley I'm doing the Joe Rogan motivational speaking training seminar I was talking about because there's clearly a thing you've done and you have done a lot of and you could be like I want to know how this all happened you know how do I get my own podcasts to do but there's a lot of people out there who are sort of not they can't be a religious leader cuz that that that does require some work and you got to develop a new take on Jesus which is hard but but they are doing this thing where it's like they're just they just are motivating people based on the fact that they've read motivational books yeah the new take on Jesus is what Bieber's guys doing right is that I keep hearing wisps of Bieber's that what's happening is he Jesus has some Jesus guy who's also influencing athletes who was the athletes he's got I don't know look at her yeah but he's some up-and-coming Jesus new take on Jesus apparently just really knows how to sell it here's how to tickle those balls of Jesus lovers well because I think it you know you get to that deeper level he's been famous since he was about 12 and all the money and he's probably had all the sex with every different combination of humanity he went oh yeah that's with and they got stem-cell people working on me like a mermaid he's done all the substances he can do and all the combinations and he's he's had all he you know he's like he's had all the new houses all the cars and then you wake up and I'm like what does this mean and something you take on Jesus for you oh yeah yeah yeah yeah you got a wonder man like I get a pull out earlier that's why you gotta like as far as if you once you get to that let it be bird retired five years ago is this the guy oh Jesus oh oh that isn't you take one guy my podcast three hours but you can find out what the fuck that dudes all yeah that's that isn't he take one look at that what the haircut and everything yeah like the Jesus beard but Jesus with the hipster haircut yeah he looks like a band member yeah it looks like yeah like he's in like I could see him on the neck tattoo yeah see that's that this is like grungy Jesus because he's not with like a pastor's normally wear suits and stuff but yeah interesting hmm I don't think that anybody can get through what Bieber did and be any better than he is I think it's insane to think that you could take a child and not have them go through the normal developmental shit that we all go through not being liked and trying to get people to like you and dating a girl and being getting your heart broke and you know getting in a fight and get in arguments and not having any money like in your neighbor's houses and here getting a fucking yet neighbor's mansion oh this I mean he did a lot of fucked up shit but I mean he is essentially like living on his adolescent with a billion dollars in public yeah it's insane and I mean we already saw how that works out with Michael Jackson like it yes it doesn't it doesn't doesn't go well fuck has ever got through maybe Jodie Foster but I don't know her but yeah might be the once I think she got through but she also like turn the volume way down like disappeared she moved in Paris she lived her life she had a whole family of people like yeah so yeah she you know it's like Kurt Russell's another dude who like was a huge movie star as a kid and now it's just like you know not it but most people don't get through that yeah I mean the entire cast of Diff'rent Strokes is gone maybe that yeah it's like that you know that's not a that's not a you know I have my daughter I have two daughters but my oldest daughter is definitely a performer and wants to be in stuff and I told my agent yesterday if you ever see me bring her in here like I think I'm ready I'm like that means that means we're done yeah that means that I've lost all perspective because yeah I mean I don't think you're even a person until you're 25 you know work in progress so I don't let you rid of car do 25 yeah we need a person behind the wheel yeah I didn't by the way I didn't have that opinion until like maybe about five or six years ago I'm like slowly starting to develop that like realizing that when you see someone who's young and stupid and doing dumb shit like Oh their fucking brains not even ready yet yeah I mean it I think that well the older you get you might keep raising that level to end up being 30 anymore yeah that age bias you know and I think it's probably 60 yeah I think it's an age bias I think it's it's just understanding who you are now today is very different than who you were a decade ago or - yeah - dick and if you're not you fucked up yeah thank you that's I think that's amount I we caught a man who thinks the same way as 50 as he did at 30 his way through 20 years of his life you know you should be going through some new experiences you should be wiser yeah wiser getting you to be like man I can't believe I do that stump shit yeah that's why it's really sad when you talk to someone who's 50 who doesn't know anything about the world doesn't read doesn't pay attention isn't so awful about Trump is he seems completely uncurious individual he doesn't seem like to me that's the worst that's worse than dumb that's worse than racist feel like he's just completely uncurious about the outside world well also the way he like adorns his homes with gold like a 12 just got like a magic bottle yes he gets to rub this genie bottle and like what do I want I want everything gold the furniture the chandelier and if it's not total gold I want it gold color do you know like you know you know the people because the white house this people work at the white house forever I'm gonna who the presidents you know those people are they're like what is he doing is that what he's doing the White House there's a whole renovation that's happening like that's why part of the reason they said he went on his seventeen day break is that they were doing a bunch of renovations in the White House he allowed to just do whatever he wants you do whatever you want so what if you wanted to do like black like eggs Jimi Hendrix and Bruce Lee that's the problem with with the presidency heretofore we thought there was limits on stuff right and Trump doesn't believe in limits everybody was reserved we thought oh it naturally the natural selection of running for president only elevates the best people or the people most prepared for the job and I mean I'm not obviously there's lots of people your point to know that person but we generally people thought that like just the natural selection process like in the same way that like kind of like Connor just kind of McGregor just upset the whole thing usually we've thought up until then you had to be a professional boxer who had lots of fights before you got to Floyd Mayweather right and then Conor is like I don't think that's a way that works that's a completely different situation but I'm not this is not about me I think that I'm a big car fan so I'm not I'm not mad but you know you're right so in new ways a new way to be like I didn't know you could do that and then it makes other people get so I think Trump has done that to the presidency where it's like we thought there was a just the process of natural selection ended up with somebody who at least had a through-line of an idea right if you don't agree with bush george w bush or you don't agree with clinton you at least knew there was a through line of an idea and I think with Trump there's not the belief that there's a through line of an idea yeah and it's there's also this idea that he wings things yes like he gets and has these press conferences like that one that he had that was really set a lot of people back like just a couple of months into his presidency we went on this like 70 minute rant and just you know rallied about fake news and people came out of that going what in the fuck was that like was her no that was was that recent the recent one yeah no I'm talking like way okay one of the first ones that he did I remember I got texts from friends who Republicans were like this nine seems unstable yeah yeah no and I think that I mean I think the one in Phoenix felt a little bit like you know it's a little bit like Jeff Foxworthy doing the old you might be a redneck jokes like dude write some new stuff like he was still doing like the same stuff like yeah he's still going over the same he's still legislate he's like dude stop saying crooked Hillary we have moved as a nation even fans of Hillary like we got it move on yeah he's still doing the same electoral victory and all these things that he's been doing it doesn't seem like it to a new idea man well that was one of the really sad moments when he was confronted by a reporter and he was talking about how he won by the biggest margin ever and then the reporter said well actually sir that's not true because of this and that net and he goes why from Republicans as a Republican it's like no that's not true rattling off yeah the actual station he goes well you'll agree that I won by a large margin right it was you are the president thank you what who are you like what kind of crazy eco battles have to have on live television this is a guy who's way more related to be where the knees to any other president as far as like he's surrounded by people who have told him good good job good decision I mean the ins there's a the insanity of like first of all there's the fake Time magazine cover that was in one that was in his I mean that's that's insane that's not that's just I mean we've all taken the fun fake magazine cover it way we don't put it up and make people think it's real you know then there's another one that they decided found it recently at one of his golf courses there is a fake Confederate Monument there's like a plaque that says there was a battle here that was they call this the river of blood the da-da-da-da-da and can they talk to give historians like none of that none of that happened it said it's and it's got Donald it says Donald Trump under the bottom like he say Donald J Trump this is what I this is what happened here and if none of it none if not it's not like oh it's an exaggerated Tom comes golfcourse plaque honors fake civil war about holy shit the river of blood people like that's not this was never holy shit that is insane that's like yeah the Potomac River near the 15th green is shown during round three of the Senior PGA Championship at Trump national golf course on May 27 buh-buh-buh-buh-buh 2015 report about a factually inaccurate inaccurate plaque featured at Donald Trump's Northern Virginia trump National Golf Club has resurfaced this week in light of the president's controversial remarks about the violent weekend in Charlottesville fucking amen and they went to like three different historians and one day and they were like yeah that's there's no he's not even getting something wrong it's not like he just thought yeah it's just that didn't do you think he did that or someone did that when I wanted to him in the New York Times story they questioned him about it and he says no I talked to historians who said it was a very bubble bubble bubble he's he it's in the scene up no uh-uh no way nothing like that ever happened there we had him in about the accuracy of the plaque however and told the publication that he was certain that the area was a prime site for river crossing so if people are crossing the river and you happen to be in a civil war I would say that people were shot a lot of them you're in war is the battles not everywhere people are the Trump a self-professed big history fan was unable to name the historians he claimed it told him the site was known as the river of blood Wow this is it so Wow to me wow that's crazy yeah that's been there for a while so to me it's like this is again this is where the press forget the fake news media the fake the fake news this is where the press really fucked up is by entertaining him through the election season without really making it a hard effort to go right at the truth of the matter like people thought again I think people were seduced by did well its he's not gonna win so we're gonna drain the swamp we're getting good and well I mean even people who didn't agree with him people on the Left who were like he's not gonna win I had friends who are like I didn't waste time thinking about it yeah probably no way sometime that they that they didn't people didn't go after him hard about all these little things meanwhile let's again Barack Obama had to pull out several copies of his birth certificate and yet people want to go I don't know if he's racist Trump I don't know here's my take on I don't give a fuck if he was born in Kenya yeah I don't care I don't remember where I was born they told me I was born in New Jersey but I wasn't there yeah you were there but you are you're barely out I didn't understand words like I didn't understand cities yes it's not your choice where to be born the idea that you're better off because your choice would be you sum up by divine birthright you were shit out in Michigan yeah so you you could run this country that's why the whole immigration thing in the refugee thing is ridiculous is insane but that's but it's it's it doesn't it shouldn't matter but it does matter and also they were using he was born in Kenya as a way to promote a lot of conspiracy theories that were connected to him that were none of that if you start to buy the he was it was a fake birth certificate cuz his parents when he was born knew he was gonna be the first black president so they got him a fake Hawaii burn ticket and that then you attach a lot of things then that illegitimate his presidency cuz it seen if trumpet said I don't agree with Obama's policy on this and this and this and left all this stuff behind didn't yet let's let's see the run for president well the craziest one was that he was some sort of a Manchurian Candidate some sort of a undercover Muslim that was sent yeah destroy America he's trying to destroy America can't he just be a disappointing President must we take it to that that's the part about this disturbing is that Obama who was just they were questioning the legitimacy of his presidency like just the fact that he shouldn't be President cuz he's not he wasn't born here in this country and he's a and then with Trump all these things should be coachable should question should is he fit enough to run for president right is he meant is he is he a serious enough person cuz I don't know you know he can you question people's mental facility but he's he a serious enough person to run for president it's clearly no he's not serious enough to be President you have fake Time magazine or fake Time magazine one is almost inexcusable I mean it absolutely an excuse babies almost it on the cover of Time more than anybody else which is again it's like this is not true but had he been on the cover before actually be yeah but there was like but yeah but he had been he I think I think it was up he had been on the cover but not that that picture it wasn't that picture it wasn't that there was whatever we do that then why would he just frame the real one this is you to ask your but that's what's crazy right I mean the guy is actually been on Time magazine so he has I don't know that but he's already been on the cover of magazines I mean sure yeah yeah if I get another one you know yeah get one it's not like you're not famous yeah that's the weird part yeah he needs to feel like the most famous he needs to feel like this but what do you think what's the thought process behind that did someone bring that to him did he say I need to be on Time magazine's they don't want put me on get make me a fake one that's a real one no that's that's the fake look remember say Trump is hitting on all fronts even TV it's not Entertainment Weekly Obama's next move Kenny curb health care cost how stressed in Japan that's weird The Apprentice is a television smash Wow it would it I feel like somebody made it for him as a joke and then he you know is this real this one's real okay what does it say there screw this man may turn you green within me or just turn you off flaunting it is the game and Trump is the name that seems like a real one yeah yeah but it's also not complimentary enough exactly yeah yeah he's not hitting on all fronts yeah many people have looked at the originals like it's clearly not the right like the font is it laid out as also do things a bit yeah well it looks like yeah it looks it looks like you go to like the like a carnival and they give you like you know put you in the cover Sports Illustrated I don't like his lips there's something about it like people like when they make faces with their lips Lincoln can tell if they're kind yes it's that it seems so weird to say that but it seems to be true well yeah it's like he that he doesn't again he does not angry yeah he looks he looks like he's perpetually either he looks he looks disappointed when he sits there it's the massive amount of money and power yeah and then deciding no I think he yeah I don't think he could have anticipated that he was running against 16 people were the 15 people who just couldn't who who should have all been leaked cleared like you know any of them should be like oh my Jeb Bush but they none of them had enough personality tests to top him Jeb Bush seemed like you didn't really want to do it either he seems like he was kind of like half-ass in it well I don't think George W really wanted to either that's the reasoning about America you can become the president and even really wanted if you're a rich white dude like you I guess I'll be the president well who the fuck is gonna do it next that's what's gonna be interesting I just hope it's not the people that whose names I already know I hope it's not people talk about baby Biden can it not be someone yeah baby I just like the thing about that was deciding about Obama the black thing was exciting for me personally but the fact that he was under the age like he was in his 40s that was exciting like he's like a president who it actually who you know and life had life and also was still had a lot of life ahead of him yeah like that did he now that he's done he's still like a young guy a young old man you know that he was that he had done things you had probably done easily yeah fry played video games he used a you know he with you know the the reason why he became such a pop culture president cuz it was like he would say I listened to jay-z and you're like I believe me Riley does you know I mean like I just felt like he felt like somebody who was connected to us in a way that like Trump is now he's not one of them but the whole you don't part one of the people no and he's never tried to be one of the people no it's all it's so strange it's a I've never felt like more disconnected than right now from politics and from like I've never felt like the president is more disconnected from the people the United States either and the people that support him boy there so this is I've never seen that before either the type of people that are like really into Donald Trump being president yeah you know it's just everything that he says they hang on every word they turn everything into a positive they they spin everything the hashtag Magga yes it's it's really uh and it feels to me like it's a very much a you got Obama we get him like it feels like it's very like like they were sick of how of the love that Obama got even though by the end I mean Obama got a lot of love but it wasn't his fervent by the end you know but I mean you until the end then he got fervent right before he left but it's a real sort of like a lot of that love of Trump comes from it's real like it's like wanting to spite liberals like you know hahaha like you don't care if Trump does something that's bad for you if it hurts of liberals feelings you know like you you you just you just want somebody who is hurting Hillary you know they are hurting the Liberals you're not it's not about what's good for you because if you're looking at what's good for you this is not good for you yeah well it's also like getting some sort of a read in a book conservative that would somewhat someone would step up right now would be very interesting it would be very interesting like if you could find someone who's a reasonable conservative who knows how to debate and can form a sentence and can respond under pressure to like what Trump also brings to the table is he's like this ominous sort of character yeah you know it's it's like a Mardi Gras float that walked into that there's a lot to deal with it's a lot it's a lot to deal with yeah and I think that other problem is is that you know there's all these people who are trying to position themselves as they're as the Trump alternative but then if you dig too deep into their records it's like well they really support all the things from supports but they're just not outloud racists so it's like it's not it's not it's not really like an it's not an alternative it's like I think all I think both parties it's gotta be you gotta be looking for new people like I feel like I said like in the 80s it's like the NBA just went to Africa and grabbed tall people just like there's like we need to find some new people and they got Dikembe Mutombo and Hakeem Olajuwon and just like there's like we need to go and I feel like if I'm the different party I'm scouring the United States of America for people who nobody's Expedia or somewhere who's got a good speaking voice yeah let's go get that dude I feel like that's you can't be looking at the regular halls of power do you watch house of cards I do yeah do you wonder if that's how it really goes down I was killed to feel like that that probably no no senator has pushed or Representatives push somebody into a subway train I have to sort of spoiler season one well season two yeah I have to believe that that it's but I do believe all that yeah I think some of it is true some of it's got some yeah yeah someone's got to be Basinger but the thing is I didn't watch this season of house of cards cuz I was like I can't I have to be focused on the real house with car like I couldn't I was watching it like this it's didn't land in the same it's so good okay I'll go back here back and I could I just was like I was watching it thinking they're like watching Trump tweets like I couldn't focus on that I'm like it's really bad over here guys I wonder how it's gonna play out do you think he's gonna make it through four years in the White House I think we have to those of us who don't think he should make it through four years in the White House or hope that he resigns or gets impeached can't take it for granted that's gonna happen no I don't think we can so is he gonna make it through four years the history says yes most of them do you know there's no you know there's there's not a point at which you know it's very the the impeach thing and also the impeach thing doesn't necessary get you out of office just you know so I think that Clinton was impeached yeah yeah forget ya know it's like it doesn't impeach doesn't mean you're fired we'd like to believe it does so I think it's way if I'm in Vegas it's way more likely it's like the Floyd Mayweather MacGregor odds it's like it's way more bet the bet that he makes it through yeah yeah I don't think that there's things are already off the rails so I don't think we can go well clearly he's a bookie thing as a second term I think it's I think the reality is that after four years I this is the if he does lastly four years that he gets the end of four years like this is really hurting it's also it's cuz it's hurting his business brands you know like he's like you know people are canceling hotel reservations and like I think if he sees his bottom line going down instead of going up it is it I mean I've this would have heard that like a bunch of people have pulled our reservations from like Mar Lago and things like that so when they take the name off of one of his buildings in downtown New York that makes I mean I can you do that yeah I think they decided to take the name people weren't buying condos yeah yeah find out sorry Madoff business management right yeah but I do think they're like if it's affect you really because like you know it certainly has there's a report sort of like oh Ivanka's brands are down you know like the things you learn us they thought this is gonna help that stuff right if it's not helping that stuff and at the end of four years and it's could leave cuz he's annoyed by it all but he'll have some big speech about I've done what I came to do and I think I've really drained this whale just say he did and his people be like yeah you know yeah talk about how unemployment was the lowest rate in fifteen years even though the the arc that unemployment is on is the same like arc that it's been on like it economy arcs it's all going on the same path that it was always there it's always been on I think there was some initial speculation that he was going to be good for business and then there was some sort of a rise yes is that all it's important it's good for business Trump name to be removed from three Manhattan apartment buildings he doesn't own oh he doesn't own them well I think he sells I'd know he sells his name a lot he did people think he owns more than you know okay they have been owned by a Chicago based real estate equity firm firm residential equity residential since 2005 now Trump place will remain on the condominium buildings 200 220 and 240 Riverside Boulevard which neither equity residential nor Trump own how weird for now yeah they're gonna remove it though huh well a lot of that was he was selling his name to stuff for license of his name des stuffs it was it people thought he had more than he had which is why it doesn't tax returns because it's like it's not as a it you know how weird is that cuz he doesn't show his tax return the rules are different I mean I you know how is that the rules are different for for for you know that's for rich white men the rules are different but is that but is that like a mandatory thing because no it's obviously it is not it's not a legal thing it's just what has been done and yeah the problem is is again there may they may make it after Trump that it's a legal thing all these things were sort of like that the president which is what had been done and what people assumed would always be done and then Trump the good the one shining grace of Trump is that it proved it that it exposes how that stuff isn't that's we think there's more that it's more complicated to become the president and more complicated to be the president and that there's more restraints on the president than there actually are you know now that we know that maybe but when Trump leaves eventually I think it's forget Republicans Democrats it's on the benefit of humid the benefit for the entire world that the president doesn't have the they can't launch nukes right that's just I'm not making this a republic in the Democrat it's just it should be a couple more people than just one guy but what about a pardoning people that are criminals okay how how again is that the case like you have laws yeah but then you have a president who apparently can't be charged with laws or can't be charged with crimes right which is why these women that were trying to sue him they can't do anything about it now that he's the president I know what happened cuz I was like no way get away the unemployment line is going up we can't really deal with the women who say you were harassed yeah yeah I think that's what when these women were trying to sue him when he was running for president I think he got rid of all that shit Wow I would did was I did I was like I should cool that but yeah that would happen okay I mean can he pardon himself how does that work that's the thing people don't there's like this weird there's all this stuff that happens in the law where they're like we've never actually asked that question cuz nobody thought that was a question that should be asked like nobody ever thought that a president would think to do that you know so there's all these sort of things were it's like there's no you know there's that he would he could sign a thing and then the Supreme Court have to be like is this okay you know is this okay you know get a number of pardons - right don't think you're like 20 or something like that no I don't think yeah I think that yeah yeah we have a limited number though I think there's 50 left playing the game all right pardon and now after you did Arpaio it's like the you know it's it's even McCain freaked out about our planes from Arizona yeah you know I love criminal you know now the question is why didn't you do something on it before McCain again you don't have any jurisdiction in that way but you could have been it used your bully pulpit more effectively if you thought he was a criminal before this you know McCain's defense he had a brain tumor I don't mean now I mean like no years ago I'm just scrolling down it goes forever hundreds yeah and Obama didn't do the most I want to be clear but yeah I think there is this there's there a limit does it say how many confer limit this gov website that's crazy yeah pardons are so weird yeah yeah I know you're a criminal but magic there is I mean the part of it that should be good is there are many people who are in prison again like we talked about earlier yeah for things were you like the rest of your life you know I mean like so I there is a good side to this but we thought that they would only be you but a lot of times it's like friends and colleagues and you know the way I would pardon people like Bradley Manning Chelsea Manning things mom important her that wasn't yeah that was example of like you have served Obama was like you have served more than enough time yeah 212 people but that's not the most I think that's the oh my god and and commuted the convictions of a further 1715 people heavily she had the thing where he went he actually went to federal prison and talked to inmates and it was all nonviolent people it again the same thing bright blue have been convicted of nonviolent crimes who were just languishing in prison for no you know you know yeah he smoked a lot of weed and sold a lot of weed but you've been here for thirty years you know wow yeah most of most granted clemency by Obama had been convicted on drug charges and have received lengthy and sometimes mandatory sentences at the height of the war on drugs that's the scariest thing about that Jeff Sessions asshole he will bring that stuff back and bring back just say no and start arresting people for pot like come on man it's 2017 yeah we got a catch out yeah we got and we were about to catch up yeah we were we were getting close to that well man we were getting we were getting close by because I feel like even if you had a forty five-year-old Republican president they would be they would be more open to things than the seventy one-year-old Trump you know are there any seventy one-year-old Republican or a seven-year-old Democrat just by the nature of the fact that like for the most part forty five-year-old Republicans don't care about where people go to the bathroom is long and old people shouldn't be running shit I used to I did this joke briefly but it didn't I didn't stick but it was anything like you can be too young to vote and you can also be too old to vote yeah there's a point at which there's there's a meaty part of life where you're in the world doing things and you're in the mix and there's a part where you're sort of like you know we're you know I think well at least we should we should do some checks first we should like yeah sure can you do a cartwheel yeah well does your Gosling or doesn't it doesn't make sense that it would be the oldest person to be the frit doesn't make no it doesn't make any sense what does if it's an incredibly wise old person who's like learned a bunch of things and has control of their ego and there's a person who really wants to make the world a better place but is also on some HGH so they can actually do this live up to the rigors of the job you know they mean like well that was what did you read about Obama like not Obama about people thinking that trumps on stimulant remember where I saw it from because when I looked back up like it said there's no real history of him using drugs yeah people have had rumors that maybe he was doing like fen-phen and whatnot in 80s or something like mmm stimuli system I don't know I wonder where the guy gets the energy like when he was when he was doing that whole thing with Hillary and then it was revealed that uh Hillary when they were running for president was on new vigil or provigil which is a narcolepsy drug say give it to fighter pilots to keep them awake I've taken him before it's interesting she actually was actually actually on it yeah for sure and a lot of people take that stuff yeah and what it does is it kind of keeps you awake and it keeps you alert even if you start getting tired it keeps you from falling asleep okay but not not at a press conference yeah it doesn't speed you up which is interesting because it doesn't like it's not like tweaking yeah exactly it's not like a an amphetamine it's some weird thing yeah it was essentially originally created as a performance-enhancing drug but they needed some sort of a reason to medically prescribed it to people so they went yeah what do you got here but is it legitimate no if it's actual truth but it's uh MSNBC fun fact in 1982 Trump's started taking amphetamine derivatives abused them only supposed to take two for 25 days stayed on for eight years really how the fuck does you know when you're saying something like that man you gotta you gotta have something other than it's a fun fact it's a tweet storm is there something at the end where he's good like a tweet storm I love that fucking I just texted it to somebody like what is happened in my life check out this tweet storm tweet storm I'm doctor Joseph what does it say up there it said the doctor wrote the prescriptions doctor Joseph greenberg diagnosed him with metabolic imbalance which we have never heard about again Greenberg was later publicly shamed sham Oh slammed rather sorry as someone who provides uppers to rich people in Manhattan and medical metabolic imbalance if true could be a electrolyte insufficiencies and aerobic imbalances acid imbalances an assortment of related disorders that could have serious health consequences yet his other doc dr. harold bernstein Hornstein said he had been Trump's doctor since 1980 and never mentioned the metabolic imbalance found by Greenberg house he noticed though like you have to kind of like he's writing a book and doing research you gotta have I mean I mean he's a he's a he's a I mean I he's a you know legit journalist but I yes you do have to you know but he also certainly opened himself up being sued if it's not true so you know he's gonna be sued if it is true but that would make sense because if you if you see like how much energy he had when he was running doing the campaign against Hillary goddamn the guy never got tired yeah and he would go up there to talk and talk the White House admitted it to me said only for a short time for diet when he was not overweight I countered with med records they cut me off people miss reading drug was ooh diethyl he's got the Duane Reade in Manhattan where it was filled at seven milligrams a day prescription filled at Duane Reade on 57th Street in Manhattan so he thought those things 75 milligrams a day hmm yeah I don't know what that is though but he certainly is writing a book he's apparently yeah yeah he's interesting he's certainly well that would make sense that would make sense why use this kind of energy I know so many journalists that are on adderall mm-hmm and I have a friend who told me that they're all on it I mean I don't know what that means yeah but yeah 60 what does it mean but he's like listen man they're all on adderall and that was one of the things that when I what does it was his name that uh that guy that crashed his car and there's a specific suspicious michael hastings remember that crashed his car under suspicious circumstances and they said oh well this guy had meth in his died he had amphetamines in his blood he was probably fucked up on pills no he's probably a fucking journalist yeah they're all means yeah yeah and that's what adderall is it's it's a prescription amphetamine that you can get if he's like man I've been kind of dragging ass lately wink wink [Laughter] I've never had that doctor I've had that I've been dragging ass lately you should probably exercise and get more rest [Laughter] there are other things you could do what are we to ask about these things hey bro I got back pain I'm always tired stressed with my back pain and give me I want to float through life with not a care in the world so I can take care of my family business yeah yeah I'm really stressed out you need to organize your day better talk to a therapist yeah yeah yeah we got to get someone like Elon Musk we got to get like some super genius who seems to be able to do everything well that's the thing that the other sort of good side of this is that it is so it certainly opened up the possibilities of who could be the president yeah like it is completely blown now will some person who's not a Republican you know like step through think will a liberal step through that well the Democratic Party support that person is that you know you're like the rocket might run for president you know I gotta probably he'll probably do it while he's working out talking he live streaming his run for president yeah I mean but but the Democratic Party might be like you know are they gonna get behind that kind of person you know they don't have a fucking choice this is rock if the rock decides to run for president I'll fucking help him although the funniest people like we don't even know that the rock is a Democrat you don't know what he's not a guy who has declared his political affiliation that's true and he's a you know he's a he's a rich guy yeah but he's so rich he probably doesn't even notice his taxes hit that elite stratosphere well I feel you know it's like three million more for taxes like my pump on over here yeah let's move on less depressing shit cuz I want to talk about it some I want to talk about your show okay and what has this been like for you because you know your show is a very unique show on CNN and it seems like and correct me if I'm wrong but it seems like you have a lot of creative leeway absolutely yeah sure I mean it seems like yes that's the thing about the show that has been such a it's been so cool because you know I've had a career where I was like sort of in the trenches you know for a long time just trying to figure it out and didn't think I'd ever get this opportunity and the way that I got there was not some way that made any sense but now I sit in the room I just had a kickoff meeting yesterday and it's a room full of people like what do you want to do come out and you know it's like that feel super hashtag blessed to be in that position it was not something that five years ago I wasn't like you probably independent see and also to be at CNN that wasn't where none of these things were on my like how did it happen so after my show totally biased that Chris Rock had the executive reduced I was didn't have a job didn't know what I was gonna do here in New York and that was on FX and FX and then FXX and then get the FX out of here so yeah it was on it was on it was on FX now FX is legit Channel but we my show helped launch FX and didn't do a good jobs that's why they shoulda got cancelled but so I started to take meetings like general meetings and I ended up it and it was all with sort of news organizations like little online like I thought it wasn't like entertainment channels it was all these news things that thought like you could do something here with your thing and nobody had a real idea and I went to CNN I met Jeff Zucker had the like a 15 minute meeting with Jeff Zucker where he was like had 18,000 TVs on and gave me a news quiz he's like you pay attention to the news I go yeah and he gave me a news quiz to see if I paid attention to the news really yeah like he's like let's see I'm give you a quiz like what did he ask you it was all the kind of shit that if you have and like a CNN app on your phone you would know all of it it's like it was really like he was just the big news stories of the day like it was like you know uh do you know what what's app is what's app it just been Facebook I liked it so I would have to bought by Facebook like it was like a game show me yeah it was just like I mean it was funny but he just wanted to see I don't you know people have don't have much respect for community I don't mean Jeff right as as people who were paying attention all the time you know thinking what to see if I was for real yeah so and then so they want to see your mindset well you know are you concentrating on being the next Kevin Hart yeah do you have any actual interest are you gonna can you come into this new space and be well can you because the I'm saying you can't you have to sort of be paying it into the news okay pay attention to what's going on here the Bridgegate thing in happening is like what do you think Christie should you and I sort of ripped some things out he's like alright it's the same shit Trump's on so he so then they had been pitched the show by this company all three media now main event media called black man white America where a black man travels around to all two white spaces in America that was the premise and they told me that and I was like dad don't only do like you know like I wouldn't want to do that I'd want to do it if I could travel through more than just white spaces and they liked that idea and then the guy Jimmy Fox he hates when I tell the story cuz he's like it was such dated he's like he realizes now it was not the best idea but it was like so then we changed it to you he changed it to United shades of America and then we pitched the Klan episode that was my idea to tell the pilot episode was me with the Klan what the fuck was that like I mean it was funny people asked me that I feel like it's exactly what you think it was is I mean you know it was a I like because it was different version of the Klan the big one was where they were to where I went to the cross burning what they call a cross lighting be politically correct so it I mean I I drove into this place I had the camera crew there was one security guy there we go that was the first day of my first day at work on the United States of America that was the last thing we did that did get the trailer ya know it was off in the woods in Kentucky and that was the my first day on the job this was the last thing we did was watch across burn and we and also when we got there we got there during daylight so we had to be there for several like two or three hours while like they like did all their rites where I talk to them and interview then they did rites and rituals and then it ended with them setting the cross one friend they were more than willing to do all this on television which is even more shot yeah they mostly there you can see up there they mostly kept their hoods on but one guy and kept his hood off so you could see his face but yeah they were all they I mean people ask me like why would they want to be on TV cuz everybody wants to be on TV like we talk to a bunch of different Klan groups and are they the producers did most of them didn't want to be on TV but there was like three or four that did cuz they were they thought they were spreading the word maybe they were you know you know what was their message like when you were talk with them like what what was the reason for them doing this they believe America is a white country ordained by God that way they believe the Bible says that's true they believe the Bible America it's like I'm not telling you what I believe but they believe that the Bible doesn't think the races should mix the Bible doesn't you know all these things that people quit out of the Bible the Bible talking about donkeys and they were like they you know so the data and they believe that America is a white country founded by white people and that that the people who like the black people and the Mexican people and eventually the Catholics and the Jews own against a cooler with Catholics now that you stay at the Catholics should get to leave go back home and because of America is they in it then though and the whole America is for white people is the whole white is there just a different way of saying the white ed no state thing that a lot of the people other than alright in the National the white national movement say then so you know who they they think that this is that the you know this is they they think of America they think this the whole idea of America is that it's for whites only and that the rest of us need to go home how did that feel for you I mean I be standing there with these people in the woods in Kentucky looking into the eyes of madness yeah whether we're in satin sheets over their head with holes poked out for eyes well it's sort of it was a lot of it that was funny I mean it was it was like we got there I got out of the car and there's a line in the in the show where you can hear me before you see that I'm going like and that was really me saying this was not a good idea that was not me making a joke because I see a phalanx of them and they're all standing there at attention and right when we got there the guy who wasn't all blue was like immediately goes into a rant about Ferguson it was in 2014 it was all about Ferguson and how black people are police themselves and the white man is gonna doubt it well at the same time they don't advocate violence because it's clear that at some point they were told if you talk about violence the FBI will be here every weekend you know so they're like we don't advocate violence we have Kate self-defense we don't hate black people we just love our people but also black people can't look what they're doing in Ferguson that shows the black people aren't whatever blah blah aren't the equivalent of the white man and and so I had so we first started shooting I there was just like this guy was just going off and I just thought it was like having to take it and wondering is this gonna be the next three hours this kind of like yelling and the producer stepped in and said all right everybody let's just oh we got to check the camera for a second and we slowed it down and then we set up chairs and we sat down and started talking and from that point forward they were so excited to talk about their clan thing because they don't get asked that a lot that they sort of like eventually you would if you weren't thinking that it was the Klan you'd be like yeah there's just people talking about their lives I don't agree with them but they're not they didn't stay angry by the end they were like oh brother this means it was a good man yeah they certainly hug it out no do not take any pictures of me hanging out like wow because I'm doing it this way like yeah thanks man yeah yeah you know but you know trying to reason with them ya know I talked to like cuz you know cuz you go well you know you know like there was one point they said the Bible says that uh that you know man should not deny today but the Bible also say you shouldn't eat lobster you know what do you think well I just went to Red Lobster last night brother and you know so they recognize the hypocrisy but they can't see why it doesn't make sense like you know they they don't see why like well if you you're just saying these things these aren't the the Bible should not be the reason this is happening you know and so it's just a convenient way to justify their and their goofy clothes yeah and so they I mean they're they say they don't this is the called the week the the new Klan they don't hate black people they just really love white people but I feel like you can really love white people but it didn't come with at the expense of black people feeling safe or anybody feeling safe it's the same thing with you all right you can think what you want to think but nobody should feel like their safety to be violated in that process so you know the funny thing was is that so we would film any we'd have to stop down cuz we're changing cameras whenever we'd stop down they pull off the hoods off and they'd be like man it's hot under here and I was like yeah maybe you guys should have designed the hoods or breathable fabric maybe get Under Armour in here but they didn't we be news on camera because we get into their faces but yeah so it's like they were like but there were some there was like two different groups there was one group who like was okay talking to me and then there was another group who every time we stopped down they would go away they would walk away and one of them was this blonde what there was the one who was in red when she took her hood off she was like I mean she looked like the you know Britney Spears at 18 like this blonde you know I as we found earlier we don't know what pretty white woman looks like but she was a bronze but she had red fingernails but and she was wearing a red red sugg thing because she's fourth-generation clan so her thing is all red and she looked like because she's fourth generation she was red you get to where yeah Ballu I don't I didn't get the whole generation so she but she's like so she like every time she took her hood off she look like he's like how like she was like she wanted to kill me you know never fuck you well yeah or that they never never and I was like couple drinks in there you guys start dancing like la they would there's a whole life for you out away from Kentucky where that you would have you know I can make a lot of money off your head it's not so funny though that it's just what you're exposed to you're a young child and you just don't understand you're going to then you're born to the clan and your pet and there's not black people there's not enough black people in a community for you to go well that's weird cause he's black people are fine cuz yeah in this part of Kentucky there's not a lot of black people there are there are some because that's black people everywhere but there's not enough to like sort of for these people interact with and you're told to avoid that black guy who works at the Home Depot then you end up you know and you just see that it's like it's about circumstance it's not necessarily about you know if we could get the if you get people out of these circumstances I think they would change but I but the momentum of the input of the environment that you're in it's just kids so people get so wrapped up and then caught up in it and it becomes how they think and it's you don't want to stand out from the group you don't want to be ostracized to me and there's a fucking cross it's not gonna light itself okay we're really excited like this one guy talked to we sort of built a rapport in that moment and he was excited to talk about how they burned away like where do you get the wood from why do you dude like well he was excited it was like you know it comes like this old like this old cross you know like he was excited to talk about this stuff and so we sort of talked on that level and I still asked Albany and I was like obviously I don't agree with you guys and I said it once I was like in a hope league at the end you'll let me leave which I was kind of joking and I also like at the whole time I was like I don't know what's what if this is a setup what if I'm here to talk to these 15 guys and then a hundred clans members running out of the woods to take down CNN you know this is before fake news Trump but I was like I don't know I so the whole time I was there I also felt like this could go bad at any time because when we pulled in there was a guy holding like a like a rifle and we told them no guns and he was like I don't believe I'm gonna bring my gun and so it just felt like this could turn I'm not gonna do anything to turn it badly but this could turn bad and so it felt like it felt the whole time when I was making jokes with the clans people go how could you make tucks to the clan I was actually using self-defense like I was like cuz if you're making people laugh they generally and I wasn't making them laugh at my expense I wasn't making them laugh about well that's weird why do you burn is that you know that it actually felt to me like I could gain control the situation did you have any sort of reasonable debate with them or report like any back-and-forth with them we liked it was there anybody that you kind of felt like they saw how ridiculous it is no I mean I think we like it I would like like the I would make them laugh about ridiculous things that were happening like like they were having a hard time like like getting the like getting kerosene rags to wrap the cross and like the endings like I need a clans went over here and it's like what do we have to do to get a Klansmen over here laughing but I'm like it's but there's not a sense of like here's what I felt like by the end I knew some of those guys liked me in that moment I felt like they'd laughed at what I said they were certainly like trying to Chum me up give me their business card you if you need any help find another classmate cuz there's some Klansmen we're out here that a full of shit and you need to go to the real like there's that level of rapport also there's like there's factions that yes agree with other facts like that it's like you know it's it's like I feel like it's very similar to martial arts school this is the start at the same school yeah but you didn't get the real stuff so yeah so but they were very chummy at the end but also I was like I don't get the fuck out of here but I did feel like some of these guys went to bed that night cause a lot of fun and now I'm not saying that like they dropped the Klan thing cuz I didn't come back the next day but they were like you know I've left there feel like I wonder if I came back like in it you know in six months just drove through was like hey guys why are you wonder if you guys are on some sort of reality show we're stuck on an island for six months yeah I mean I think a lot I mean the reason why big cities are more generally more liberal than the surrounding areas is because everybody's on top of each other right it's just because everybody's on it I don't have time to hate you because you make it I like your bodega like you make it you know I don't usually become accustomed to each other you realize it's just people and you also the benefits of that thing like the Puerto Rican Day Parade is fun you know I mean like it's like your life experience is your are benefited by the fact that you're surrounded by lots of different that is really interesting when you put it that way I mean you do find that the bigger cities tend to be way more liberal like New York and LA in particular certainly more liberal than the surrounding it's like you know Houston is is a blue dot but it's not as blue as like Berkeley is but right the surrounding area is much different show and yeah it out there yeah you get yeah you go out there the ranches yeah are you you know so I think that to me that's what the whole thing is is that you're just not you don't have enough you don't get the benefit of having a diverse community because you're like which Chinese restaurant do I want to go to not right and you want to go to the Chinese restaurant you know in right that's run by the Chinese family who's like this well it's also the fear you know the fear of the other when you're not around them I think if you were around people all the time that are all sorts of different people it just you you find assholes that are white and cool people that are brown and you sort of go oh they're just humans yeah yeah we just were terrified and so we lump off into groups so we somehow or another have people that we relate to well I mean I think it's a whole thing about like we are we have we have fear of the unknown and somehow every of the unknown is the fear that somehow that unknown thing is gonna hurt us or affect us in some negative way it's I mean you know when Obama first one into the White House you know you could I would have lost money on get out and marriage equality gay marriage not a lot someone's like I was like that's not gonna happen that's you know I there's no I didn't have I would have put 50 years you know I mean really why just because I thought that ball was moving in that direction anyway but I still wouldn't have thought that it was gonna happen in his with in his eyes I just did it first was not an issue he came in campaigning on so it wasn't like something that was I didn't think it was on his on anybody's a gen and it was on some people's agenda they were working on it but I didn't think it wasn't something that was like we didn't the good nation didn't set that as a goal it wasn't like a thing like Obamacare was like we need to fix this so it sort of happened in a way like the people worked behind the scenes to make it happen and then it just sort of we woke up one day and opened our phones up and it was like it's legal wait what federally yeah yeah yeah like you just sort of happen to you like what we thought nothing that's it that was one of the most disappointing things about Hillary is that she didn't up until 2013 she didn't support marriage equality yeah I mean Obama was like you know he had the thing that he sort of stopped talking about it for a series of years and then eventually was like Joe Biden was like I'm with it and Obama had to be like goddammit yeah I wasn't ready to say it yet touchy subject among some people but yeah but I think but it still is among some people there's certainly people's country but it's there's a critical mass of people were like it doesn't actually affect me right and right now we're going through that with with trans people in bathrooms like it doesn't it doesn't actually affect you you know it's people trans people one of the bathroom for the entire existence that there's been bathrooms you just didn't know it doesn't actually affect you you know and I think you think it you were sort of saying this is weird to me this is scary to me so it's wrong but it's like no it's just weird and scary to you those feelings are just the feelings of the UH no doubt now assess the threat man I think that woman goes to the bathroom like there's not a threat that's coming after you well I think people are scared of people taking their clothes off the generals already were like it's cool we just need bodies like you know like the military was already like it already accepted trans people they're like we just need bodies we need people here who are good soldiers well the military was real weird because he's a he apparently did that while the hurricane was hitting yeah he C pardoned our piyo did that and there was one other thing that he did I'm not exactly sure what it was he started bring up the water and recently controversial thing yeah yes I'm gonna get Mexico to pay for the wall don't do you think the Mexicans should be paying for education take care of the poor people so a lot of issues they have to take care of enough time for your farm and there's just no way you can make them pay for the wall there's not it's not a thing you can't you know I mean unless we're talking about invading Mexico and sting going into the banks you know like it's that that were talking with have you heard about the wall being a gigantic solar panel would be a gigantic solar power to generate electricity you know that that's but then you'd have to accept solar panels the problems with the whole folks yeah some people just want to burn trees chop trees down yeah Mike Cole yeah yeah so from so for me the like you know back the whole thing with the show is like it's it for me it's not about me coming to agreement with people all right sometimes it's people like I do agree with but I don't know your issue a lot so I'd like to talk to you about it it's just about the fact it's me it's like it's about we're gonna have this conversation people are gonna watch this conversation yeah and that will create more conversation well you're getting this weird opportunity bequite to be again like I'm saying that you're you like I know you so when I see you on TV I'm like oh that's that's you yeah link and that's that's not normal for a television show no you notice when people take on the the host of whether it's The Tonight Show or one of those kind of shows they automatically become this different thing than they usually are they become like the host of a show and for me that the reason that is is because there wasn't like we're not there's not a ton of these shows out there right like so there's not like it's like oh come on got that show it's like talk shows the minute I got totally biased sometime seeing articles about the Tonight Show you know a latent Late Late Show and totally biased wait what and then I'm being compared to those people and I'm being judged against like well last night foul and lip sync with Justin Timberlake I'll talk to Laverne Cox that's not the same thing so I read that swai didn't like about that is that people were suddenly defining me against that thing and I was not and I would look at that show me like that's not me and I had friends who'd watch this show and be like that's not me and then we'd write things for the show and I'd say things like this I don't believe this you know or I don't feel as passionately about this as this show makes me think I feel about this because we just have to get the show done right whereas with this show I can go night I'm not saying that or I or I really want to say this and I can rewrite things and I can go yeah so it's totally biased you did in front of an audience and it was like more of it that I don't think that that forum works I don't think that's a good way final thing for anybody I don't think it's a good way to have meaningful conversations no giant groups of people and yeah everybody's clapping yeah so you're trying to like play to them to make a good point so yeah necessarily expressing yourself like what is my what is the were the real thoughts going on in my mind as much as you're just trying to I get those points yeah laughs and I yeah and the thing that I and I give credit to Chris Rock for this because he's the one who made me do the man on the street segments on totally biased he was like idiot out there people don't know who you are you need to mix it up with the people and I was like I don't like I really didn't like whenever I saw people around the street it was always like hey dummy why'd you stop and talk to me you decided to be nice and stop and talk to me now I'm gonna punish you for it right aside from Billy on the street I think that's the version of it that I feel like it's like he's half those people get to have fun with it with you Billy on the street yeah Billy Eichner yeah I mean it's just whenever I see that I go he's sort of he's the joke Brian he's not making it you know it's not like the thing like what year was the war of 1812 you idiot you know it's so I feel like I did I'd only seen it that way so when I did when I did it I was always like just trying to like let them talk and then if they got the joke I would tag the joke or if I thought of something funny I wasn't necessarily against them it was a in that it was about something situation it was funny and so that trained me for United change I United chases the show I think that's the I think that's the only show I could ever do like I can't there's not other shows in me where I would be on camera like that there's I'm not an actor I'm not trying to get sitcom not you know I'm not there's always a refreshing yeah I just don't have any interest I'm not trying to audition for movies I don't audition for anything good I live in Berkeley so I don't leave I'm not even available to audition for things so but this I might get this or versions of this but the thing was it was basically in my mind it was based on like the Bourdain model and Morgan Spurlock's work and like and like even like Michael Moore's work where I'm like those things are about them right that like when you watch for your perspective it's about it it's about this person and and you'd watch bored if you like Bourdain you'd watch him do anything it's not just about where he's going it's like about I just want to hang out with the dude for an hour yeah I feel like with with United shades the more it becomes that I just want to help them out for now is the bet then that's the show I want it to be yeah well you've figured out a way to do it man and kudos to CNN for allowing you to just be yourself yeah there's the people always ask all the time how much push back to you get I think the most pushback we got last season was I had we had to fart jokes in the show and they're like but they're different fart jokes intentially right to fart jokes in the show it's just we have presented with two opportunities for four jokes Larry yeah so it was like so they really put it's never like they actually the didn't I want to be clear on this they want the show I'm always want the show to be smarter they want the show to be smarter I want the facts to be vetted and clear they want that they want the the journalistic integrity because it's not a news network but they don't pitch angles like they for example they're like you know have you thought about do anything with Asian the asian-american community that was what they said and I was like I'd like to talk about Chinatown you know I mean so that's I get to take their suggestion and put it into it and put it into my version of it and nothing and I was like I'd like to take it to talk about Chinatown in San Francisco so I can film an episode near my house and I have to travel and I'd like to meet Shannon Lee like we did Shannon Lee's in it oh yes Lee's daughter yeah yeah yeah so it was like I got to make the version of the show I wanted what the same time talking about the history of Chinatown and doing other things but it ended with me the last line is like you know I really learned a lot this week Who am I kidding I just want to become friends with Shannon Lee because I'm a comedian I can do that I'd rather have some sort of like you know this and I sort of sometimes the people who write like because people will write parts of the show and they will write it like the way a journalist would do it this week I've learned that people come together and there's some of that that's still ends I have to keep sort of pulling out like it's not do you why do you write monologues or do you just talk there what happens is like with somebody they will write like sort of the version of the script and then I will get that and then sometimes I will pull whole sections out and then and then once we get into the vo booth it's me and usually a couple of the comedian's like Ethan Berlin kranji this week season gonna be doing Kennedy who will then will sit in like we'll be on the phone together in the vo booth and sort of like riff other things out yeah it's great to actually be able to hire cuz I had two guys with clear scene and I need to hire comedians on this show right I can't just be me and the news people or the TV people well it seems like not just a show but also an opportunity for you to just sort of broaden your experience with human beings mhm which is interesting I mean we went to Barrow Alaska in the first season what is that where is that it's the northernmost tip of Alaska it's inside the Arctic Circle geez nobody visits Beryl like it's not a not like a parts of Alaska where like Anchorage well let's go visit it's not a place where it doesn't do tourism you I mean you could go but there's nothing to do there what time of the year you go we went in I think it was it was wetter where was it was spring in the rest of the America but it was still like you know deep snow on the ground and frozen and but it was like it was like negative toward is right there Jews yes inside the Arctic Circle like we actually walked so far in North that we were on the ocean but it was still frozen you know the ocean yeah we were like on standing on the water what did you do there it was because we're we're we're have you never been like sometimes that's how we're clowns we have you never been right we should go to Alaska well doesn't it just go to regular Alaska let's go let's go to the part of Alaska that even though that even though like we went to Anchorage for part of it and even Alaskans don't go to Barrow cuz there's not it's a place where people go there to work for the oil companies people work for companies that work for the oil companies so it's not like and it's like it wasn't a camp yeah it's a camp but it's you know it's 4,000 people in Anchorage is weird community Anchorage when I was there one of the first things I saw we were driving the rental car to the hotel was a group of people stay on the sort of a corner holding up signs saying honk for equality people were honking as they drove by and and I was there was like all these people with like purple hair and shit I was like oh this like a real City ya know Anchorage is like I mean it's like Bakersfield it's not it's cool when I was there yeah it's like it's like it's a real it's like a you don't for me the only thing was it was it was cold but it wasn't in colder another place and there was like there was more salmon choices like everything everywhere you went they were like and we have salmon you know fresh halibut yeah yeah and we have jerky salmon jerky so it was like it was that's why I'm glad we went to Barrow cuz barely is like like I loved it I was like I'll never come back here again like there's just there's no way that unless I was doing something and you know so that for me like that's what it's fun in that episode was people like that episode a lot I thought it was because it's not sometimes people think the Epis the show is just me talking to scary people but most of the show is just me talking to people that I've never talked to before just getting a chance to see America yeah and and like you know so we didn't have so problem we said we see some Muslims but it's like well that's a big topic but we went to Hamtramck in Dearborn Michigan it's a super small town the highest percentage of Arabs and Muslims in America like 30% Arabs and Muslims in this town and it's like a sleepy suburb where you just happen to see lots of women and hijab walking around like you know like but it's you would be a sort of feel like is this right this is seems it's just like it's just a sleepy suburb I was outside of Detroit or inside a Detroit there's ham carrots in the middle of Detroit and it's just this small town that happens to be because of the Ford factory like small things that happens a lot with immigrants like like the Ford factory was okay hiring immigrants back in the day or Muslims back in the day so the Muslims like everybody come here right so then it became a very popular very populous Arab and Muslim town but it's like and then I got to sit down with a woman her name was Reema and I just got to ask her all the dumb questions about it about Islam you know and all the dumb questions about about her job in burkas and you know and how that works with feminism can you be a feminist in a Muslim that woman who's working be a feminist and a woman who's wearing a burka and she's like yeah you can it's a choice you know you know so I mean you know so I think that and then we got to talk about what what about in Saudi Arabia and they go the government of Saudi Arabia does a lot of shit that's wrong and they use Islam as a way to justify it just like the way the American government does a lot of shit that's wrong and says God and country you know it says it's not a month of religion it's about the expression of the religion so you know for me it's like to be able to ask those dumb questions we got to go to Standing Rock in the middle of Standing Rock and so like what a while that was going down the pipe the height of it yeah Wow what was that like did you get hosed no I was I was there for a few hours this was not this is that the sort of it the big sort of the first third of it I guess mmm so still not it had not turned into that and we very disturbing time yeah because they were going through people's public or private land and they were saying like no we're going through yeah and but what is private land then yeah if you just can decide to have your business go through my land and dig a fucking pipeline that may or may not poison my wells if everything goes wrong like what is public land what is private is this is it all the government's land are they just usurping my private land this is kind of fucking native people are like yeah is what they do to us this is what this is how they are yeah they're there whatever the number of treaties like because people there's like what there's several hundred treaties and they're like they've broken all of them like you know not like half of them they say they've broken all of the treaties so the Native American people like that's why they had to make a big noise like this is how they do and this was like it felt like the final straw and so hmm there were people like we got there before the winter and they're like there's people in teepees who are like and I had this whole conversation about how beeps think of teepee I thought I thought of teepees is like you're gonna have to he pees in the winter like yeah they're better than tents like there's no because there's a hole in the top and you can have a fire in the middle yeah I knew you would know yes but I was like really this guy was like he this guy was like yeah and I was and then I said to this one guy I'm like well what do you do for gets really really cold go to the hotel down the street oh all right you know like it's just like I was in this whole like native it you know like why would you there we go we go to a restaurant you know they mean so it's like it was that was my favorite episodes cuz I get to sit and ask all the dumb questions that that I've have and other people I haven't sometimes I ask them questions that I kind of know the answer to but I feel like we need to ask the dumb question right when do we have an opportunity to don't go tapping people in line at Starbucks and asking them dumb questions yeah the Dakota pipeline was extremely disturbing just because it was just was one of the clearest examples of money over rights money over land ownership money over everything that we're going through with this thing it's gonna make us money and this is what we're gonna do you should get our Huck's katara Houska on here she's a she was at Standing Rock and she speaks very awesome about all this stuff and she's a hardcore activist she was one of she was like Bernie Sanders Native American representative but and she's great about all this stuff and you can talk about how to them it's like this is just the most recent expression of this jim varnon t AR t-ara hou ska there is there she is okay yeah she i mean and she was in the episode and she we sat down I was like I'm gonna ask you a bunch of dumb questions she was like great here we go and talked about like this is just the tip of the iceberg where is that now where's that standing because when Trump got in office he apparently like green LED everything they're still people fighting against it but it's not the same you know number of people out there but they're still activists she would be able to tell you more but I would but they're still you know they're still the same they're still people fighting but they're going through it anyway right they're going right under the river and I guess this is where it gets a little bit out of my depth but yeah yeah yeah what is there what was like the I mean I don't think there's probably any one thing that was most rewarding to you but there was anything that you got the most out of doing that show during the Native Americans you know doing your show United shades and we're yeah yeah the bet the San Quentin episode is actually the one that I feel like has actually affected me the deepest that I've been back to San Quentin twice maybe three times twice since then I co-hosted it like a talent showcase with one of the inmates really yeah we were like on stage together like he wrote bits for us to do yeah I was riffing you know and it's this thing where like believe me even though I had gone to San Quentin in film do you know I went to same coat and film the show I was like walked in like this is this was on the episode I walked in with the one of the with like the co warden or the Junior Warden I guess and Sam and he was like we walk in to the to the yard he's like Heidi field I'm like cuz we're walking into the yard like you know and it's all just inmates doing sit-ups and push-ups and hanging out playing basketball he goes how does it feel I go feels can walk into a neighborhood that I don't know anybody like you know like you one's neighbor three like I need to be careful here and then as I was saying that some guy goes love your comedy bro and I go oh it feels pretty good and it was and that's exactly how it happened we left it in the show and then from that point forward it was just like if you if you like sort of close your eyes it was just talking mostly to black men who've had a lot of life experience and been through a lot of shit and who have learned a lot from there what they went through and had like done therapy and self actualized and educated themselves and all these types of things and then if but then you realized them never gonna leave they have a lot of experience out of wealth of knowledge a lot of skills and they're never going to leave and so for me it was like I can do more here so I went back we screened the episode there it was the most tense screening I ever had is like what if they hate it but they were like cheering and clapping gave me a standing ovation at the end and so I went back and hosted this talent show and again I went back still like what if this time and they're like oh come on they make fun of me because I could I didn't have to pay uh was it a pinochle they were so yeah they played pinochle in prison I know how to play and they're like you a black man I play Pinochle yes it's like just one of those crazy card games it's way too complicated that you know and they said we play Pinochle because it's really complicated it takes a lot of time yeah you don't want to just play like war in prison you want to play a game that's really like complicated so it actually sort of fills the time you have I had a friend who went to president learn how to play chess in his head yeah you did you just yell out like rook to King five checkmate yes we him and this other kid who was a chess genius we're sitting down this XCOM and this chess genius sitting down playing chess in their head in front of me I was like wow wow this is crazy and it reminds me it's like the Autobiography of Malcolm X Malcolm X said there's all this wisdom in the name in the hidden in the hood that these can be mathematical geniuses these could be the people who cure cancer but they can't they're not being put in positions where they can actually use the take advantage of this yeah and also mistakes like whatever mistake you make when you're a young person whether it's selling drugs or shooting a gun in the air for your third offense there's certain mistakes that automatically disqualify you from any personal growth for the rest of your life like that's it like you are now contained and incarcerated yeah and there'll be no growth yeah and it should be a really small list of things that disqualify you from society for the rest of your life especially like at 18 it should behave it there are things right but it should be a pretty small fine monsters yeah it should be yeah it should be like you are a monster anything that we should still check in with you every 20 every nine again ago are you still a monster like right how's my girl is there a pill yeah he said being a mom if we if we like sort of put you in therapy and educate you you're still gonna be a monster we should still be working on these people but it's certainly not in efficient it's not it's not for the betterment for society that we've taken this huge pool of people out of the prison systems and as and you know this is the thing black people are like 12% of the American population we're 40 percent of Americans prison population somewhere around there please google it make sure but it's not because we're doing 40 percent of the crime its we black people do crime but we're over sentenced a lot of times we're not getting proper representation we're not there's like the three strike law so it's like something that like a white guy and Nebraska does a black guy does in California something's in France versus life you don't I mean like it's like we're not getting the there's unequal application of the law which ends up putting us in prison at a higher rate and isn't there more people in population in prison in America than the rest of the world's prisons it might be saying we that if you look at like the graph of like Americans number of people in prison it goes like it's like it stays pretty constant for a long time and then like we're on the 80s goes long we have like some like somewhere between two or three million people in prison it goes like it goes like it goes you know you can pull it up but he goes well we're good laws that cause that it's like mandatory minimums and uh incarcerated Americans Wow look at that nineteen eighty-something it just launches straight up yeah and a completely vertical on not and it's like it wasn't people are committing the same it's like crime like man people just create so many more crimes it's just about why we were keeping them in prison longer look at that shit in the 1970s it was less look at the number less than a million people and let's talk about this we're talking about the 1970s that's the Scorsese movie Scorsese movie crime and crime is it off the streets of New York and then solid 1970 it looks like like four hundred thousand people in prison right if that's half a million mm-hmm that looks like somewhere around four hundred thousand that's fucking insane and now it's Millions and again it's not because crime got so much worse it was that we started to private prisons made it that we need to keep people in here we need to hold this is that we're making money we're this is a money-making enterprise so we need to keep people in here the real problem is once you've got something like that going on pulling that back it's gonna be extremely difficult once there's profit to be made from incarcerating people yeah and I mean there's the there's a guy and you know Shane Bauer heard the name Shane Bauer he works for Mother Jones magazine he's one of those guys who gets on the ground and but he did a whole thing where he was a prison guard in Louisiana he applied for a job as a prison guard at a for-profit prison Louisiana Wow just for the story just for the story and didn't hide his identity where do you work Mother Jones magazine we need people like they didn't do any sort of big background check and he was a prince of huge article he did a couple years ago like a year so go about being a prison guard I mean if you read it it's like the things you can get away with when you are the prison guard and the ways in which you can treat people at this prison in Louisiana or just it's like you know it's a nightmare and this worse prison is supposed to be about rehabilitation yeah that's not and it's not especially at a for pride it's about for-profit prisons that I have he's another guy that one I'm booking your podcast please do yeah yeah the amount of money that they spend is directly related to the amount of money they earn yeah so they try to feed you with the cheapest fucking food that you can get this is about and also they it's about keeping you in line it's not about keeping you you know it's not but it's not about helping you it's about human life I mean it's in the same Quinn episode I went to the mess hall with him and got and had the food the dinner and it was like first of all none of it is it's like the it's like the worst level of food like it's just like Peas you know like carrots like stewed care it's like not like there's no salt there's no there's no taste to it and then like a hot dog like not with a bun to the hotdog good San Quentin's the prison that every prisoner wants to graduate to in California and so lots of guys end up like illegally bringing food in and then making food together in their cells because they like I can eat this this is not this is not good for you you know right and also dinners at five o'clock so I can you and you eat at five o'clock and you know no one's gonna bed at 6:00 so hunger so you're still late it's like you know so like 10 o'clock at night you're hungry you have to have to figure out a different way to make something happen and what's also fucked is that you get like 30 cents an hour or something like that for working and you know what that why that is is because of the the Emancipation Proclamation didn't apply to prisoners really yeah so that's why you can pay prisoners 30 cents an hour Oh beautiful tell me some fun shit what did you do that was fun look would you enjoy what did I enjoy we did Puerto Rico Puerto Rico cuz I centipede his ship on he moved all his money over to Puerto Rico because you have to pay taxes oh yeah at the forty the whole thing of Puerto Rico is so strange but it's a to me the fact Porter goes bankrupt is like 80 billion dollars at a beach I'm sort of crazy figure of debt and it's and it's just because the US has used Puerto Rico like you know like as like it's like the ATM you know we sort of did things there and we didn't because it wasn't a state we didn't have to sort of do it the same way but it is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been in my life like yeah and I mean I was there like like we were sure when heard our Jackson was like he'd been there before he's like there's houses for $25,000 oh I was like all my way we don't own a house in California like it was it's bit such a fun beautiful place that has been exploited by the United States of America by not being a state and not being an independent country well it's weird to like things aren't allowed to ship directly to Puerto Rico they have to ship the United States and then go Puerto Rico so that everything's super expensive and super expensive but it's like for me it's like it's like being in a foreign country but your cell phone works so it's like so you get all the like different culture and new food and and you get all the like you know the people speak Spanish so if you speak a little bit of Spanish you can get by it's a super diverse place so like I as a guys married to a white woman with with a couple mixed-race kids we don't feel like we stick out there you know just sort of like and the weather was I was like I want to I want to go back so badly loved it I loved it and I don't like stuff do you think you could live there I think I could retire there I think it was all said and done I think I could be like I think at this point it'd be hard but I certainly think if my life was an East Coast life maybe there's a lot of people a lot of Puerto Ricans who live in New York who have houses in Puerto Rican yeah but then I also feel weird cause I'm not poor Rican laying in my atention fire by this house for $21,000 is that helping you or is that actually fucking you over so right to be conscious of that I believe you have to be conscious of that so I think it might did it I would but I met up I met the Governor of Puerto Rico who is not very popular but I was happy to talk to the governor so but you know the whole battle is over statehood in the end do they want it like it's really a disputed thing most many activists don't want it because they feel like why are we why are we sort of being subjugated by the United States working with your own country but the problem is they're like 80 trillion dollar like whatever it is they're they're so much in debt it's like what happens but it feels like to me like it's an onyx it's like it's like it's Hawaii it's Hawaii but it's also it's like Hawaii but it's like if we had it doesn't make sense it's in debt is what I'm saying it doesn't make sense it feels like this is a beautiful place this is this could be if you just taking advantage of what it looks like this place should be making a lot of money it just has a resort there's a resort this is a place to like and done the right way this should be making money hand over fist so I sort of feel like do I invest in Puerto Rico that's what I do with my buddy but I really do get be an East Coast guy though if you've lived all this time on the west coast I could be in well the Puerto Rico regos not the East Coast that's a different but I mean you'd have to either live there I'm talking about I'm all told I'm talking about I'm talking about that version of me that ends up with like some sort of like that somehow ends up with Kevin Hart money without working as hard as Kevin are like or somehow something happens where you go man it's weird that I invested in that you know that that that shoelace company and now though shoelaces everywhere you know that then it would be like I'll go to Puerto Rico I would certainly spend some time there and if you go to Puerto Rico though and you move all your your business to Puerto Rico you move your money to Puerto Rico you don't have to pay taxes well III believe me I'm with real weird it's my wife that would not be she's the West coaster yeah yeah she'd would not be down for that but I do think about going back I was hoping we could screen an episode there the Puerto Rico apps are there cuz it was a lot of fun but CNN dependent how many episodes you done so far we've done 16 it's a dove season Wow and so we're about to start we start filming season two like September 3rd yeah yeah pumped yeah I'm excited I mean it's been it's weird cuz last season when the show went off the air I felt like I could tell that like people didn't they sort of the talked about the show had gone away but the Trump era is good for business well how so and what do you mean like you felt that the talk had gone away well just like you know you know when you're when you're like when your special comes out and you're walking around town more people may recognize you you know like more people and then when your special is not out it's not the you know sometimes the volume gets turned down but with this like I still walk around and is like the show is still on the air people are still talking about the show and they see me there's a sense of like oh like they really feel the show in a very deep way like I hear from people like families watch the show together and like you know and I didn't make it for that reason so it's so it feels like the show we the first season show Obama was still in office so I felt like that was like the mixtape and the first season was like the out the second seems like the album and so I feel like now like people are looking for the show in a different way so it feels like knowing that I have to make sure the show steps it up a notch so that's the I feel the pressure like make sure that we don't just I'm like I'm I don't want to make the show like which white supremacist is he gonna talk to this season but we have to do other things it came right we can't be repeating that's interesting so you feel like a sense of responsibility not just to entertain but also to kind of like get some ideas out there that maybe would reach people and maybe I just I mean I feel like we're as comedians we're all responsible to our material you know they mean and so I feel like in that sense I'm not doing anything different than Jim Gaffigan is dealing you know I mean like there's these are the things I want to talk about these are the things you want these things I want to talk about you're not Jim yeah I'm not gonna yeah yes but it's but I feel like I don't want to I don't want to separate myself from it's easy to somehow I believe in the work I'm doing I'm excited about to work I'm doing I do think that the work can help lubricate changes I don't know it's not the change but I don't wanna get caught up in like the sort of the like this is important you know because I feel like at the end of the day people often say to me like do you still consider yourself comedian yes I'm a comedian yes I still do stand-up I'm trying to work on my next special like I'm still trying to do these things it's fun to be it's fun to say funny things I just like to say funny things about these things right yeah well you also you're part of this giant discussion whether you're a comedian or an author or a journalist you're part of this giant discussion which is human culture yeah and I think we need people that are articulate and thoughtful on all sides we need to like figure out that there's going to be all styles of humans the different things that people are interested in but what's got to be like the most important thing about being an American is respecting all the other styles of human all the other ways people think whether they're conservative or whether they're liberal or whether they're you know whether they choose to whatever the fuck it is you want to live off the land in Alaska or whether you want to be in Manhattan yeah whether you I mean you know whether you want to be an Alabama or they will be a Berkeley and I go to both those places so I see all those people so I think the thing is is like you and you have to realize that this is something is maybe makes you nervous or scared it's not always about you and I think that's the big thing that people get wrong about the Bay Area we're not all a bunch of liberal people on the same page we just recognize that we all go out there cuz it's like I chose the place where I can do my own thing and still meet some rich people in Marin County if you think that yes Silicon Valley well Silicon Valley people so weird though because they try so hard to go left because almost like they feel like they have to it's like a part of the business model a lot of them a lot of the people it's like I mean it's like you're like wait did you really invent anything was it like Instagram wasn't that Facebook put your pictures like you know and you're like I'm so I feel like there's probably a lot of Silicon Valley guilt in there too oh my just that's the amount of money I said I'm just gonna do the part about Facebook that's pictured now I have a billion dollars you know they're thinking soccer burgers gonna for president Trump has changed he's turned the table over so oh yeah I think in that sense let's see let's see what happens I think you know we definitely need new ideas but am i I'm not keeping for Zuckerberg right yeah but yeah I don't know I don't know the world is better now than it was in 1900 but it's a slow sort of gradual evolution of human ideas mhm you know and I think that shows like yours contribute to that and in conversations contribute to that and getting just that this is this thing is like one layer of paint at a time we're trying to build a mountain yeah you know it just it's frustrating for people because they want immediate change and I think the thing is this to take that analogy sometimes you go that was the wrong color paint I think right now I believe we're going through an error this is the error era and I don't know those I think like the the response to it has genuinely energized people to look at the surroundings look at politics look at the the way we're governing this civilization the way that we're interacting with each other and try I mean the people that are responding to these people walking down the street with fucking Home Depot candles and screaming out anti-semitic slurs or whatever the fuck they're doing that has sort of energized people in that don't agree with that and it's sort of like step up and try to understand how the fuck is this still going on in 2017 like who are these people that we didn't know existed because you live in Santa Monica ya know that you don't you're not around any of that everybody you know is you know pretty left-wing like what who or who are these people like what what part of us is represented in this ugly aspect of our culture whether it's you know people that hate white people or people that hate black people or people that hate Jews or what is this yeah like why is it still here yeah what what has failed yeah that this still still exists and I think these conversations are a big part mean what you're doing by doing your show is your you know for millions of people to get to tuned in and they get to just like hear the words and it adds layers to the way they understand human beings that's it's so goddamn important man and for me it's I mean I like I appreciate you saying that and for me there's a part of this that is holy just like I want to have these conversations yeah and I'm happy that I have cnn's budget to make these conversations happen I've always wanted to sit down with like the engine yeah yeah yeah that's the end of the project we do want to have these conversations and that's one of the things that makes them just authentic to people that are watching the show I can tell when I watch your show like this is come out like really yeah no I'm not and when I'm not interested we don't use it you know like are we - or we we really work hard to pick the right people and you know there's debates like we had a whole debate like what if we could get Trump you know what would you do I thought I had pushed back I was like in there still I was like I don't believe because I believe he's uncurious I don't believe there's any there there would you would you ask I'd rather but I don't think he would even take in the question that I was that you know I'd rather Ivanka you know I mean I'd rather like somebody who's actually who I feel like it's like you can see sometimes like order to plan you know I grew up with the internet yeah yeah I would worry I would rather you know I mean I I rather banning you know I mean like I feel like I don't believe that there's any there there would smell like sulfur he's gonna go pry carry sulfur in his pocket just like this smell like sulfur garlic he wants to create the illusion that like that I am deaf I am The Reckoning I mean in all times yeah it's like the bhagavad-gita yeah become deaf you know that's why I hate he was so alive made him the parody of him was like the Grim Reaper he was like yeah I am you know I mean that's not good yeah it's like that's what I am I am the Grim Reaper right the Sean Spicer one was hilarious because Trump thought that Melissa McCarthy doing it made him look there was a push it one point that Rosie O'Donnell do Trump and I was like that what she talked about was so good at it yeah Ballack balls great but I would Rosie would really hurt Trump's feelings and he probably would have right especially if you could say she could say some dark dark shit I love the fact that Spicer retired too when scaramouche II got on board like that's it yeah then another scare when she's gone Spicer hasn't been like today I have my job back he he nobody's heard Spicer go well I'm glad that I can finally return to my place she mentioned being the guy that has to tell everybody that this is the biggest crowd the white house for the photos that's your like the first thing you want me to tell me that is a lie and you could see the looking Spicer strains like that's I really I have a weird soft spot in my heart for Sarah how could be saying there's good she like goes out there like Oh xxx right now she's younger than that yeah she no I think she's I think she's 28 no I think she's in her mid-30s is she I think so but I don't know but I thought she was just 28 with hard years I just I like the fact that she's up there like the 2535 I like the fact that she's up there like like you kind of know she knows what's the like - I'm not blinking she said when oh but when brother Trump was attacking people on Twitter she was like if you attack him he hits back 10 times hard I'm like hey that's not good you don't teach your children that this is the president of the unity of the cheek there was a thing called presidential yeah we thought that defined the person but now what we're learning is that the person defines the word yeah he's defining what presidential is right so his supporters believe if he did it and is what Trump believes you can tell if I say it it's presidential if I say it then it's worthy of the president saying it so if me retweeting as he did the other day like you know whatever was a conspiracy theory like nonsense then that means it's it's a legitimate thing it has to be the president did it it's like the it's like the same thing with like the monarchy in England like if the Queen says it and that's what it is you know so this is where we're at it's a fascinating play if it didn't have so much of an impact on our actual well-being ya know people told me about I'm startin over yesterday he was a public school teacher and she was saying or had been a public school teacher and she's talking other folk school teachers about there are kids who go to school every day who are are born in this country you know they maybe they're from the Latino kids reborns country their parents were are undocumented and they go to school every day afraid their parents are gonna be kicked out of the country and not knowing what that does to them and now somebody's like why did you do your homework you know like it's like you're like cuz I have a lot going on right now you know why aren't you why do you see why you seem so sullen I get ahead to problem you know they mean like we're not sort of that the Trump doing all that up there filters down to some kid in the public school classroom who gets in a fight and then they expel him because he's like he's got an attitude problem you know you know that it's like people are they were not really people don't think enough about how this is affecting regular-ass people well he's a role model believe it or not because he's the president by definition is a role model for sure I mean when you were a kid when you when I was in grade school I remember kids saying I want to be President someday and other kids going wow this motherfuckers reaching for his dog yeah yeah well he wants to be the guy yeah I think wow you know and how difficult would that be but you know but then again I grew up I remember like growing up and I remember when Reagan was in office and I remember all my family feeling there was a lot of people that would like that when Reagan was in office which is so weird like the whole revisionist history thing that happened like after he was dead now he's the yeah he's the the modern great president do you guys remember the whole Ollie north thing yeah you guys remember iran-contra do you remember the guy standing in front of the in front of the court when they were questioning him saying he doesn't remember selling arms to Iran yeah like that this is remember now standing him feeding him the next thing to say yeah no I think that the so I put to me it's like I just in my lifetime it's like people were like man right you're like people I don't read Reagan was such a bad president then you get George any worse no that's a bad president then you get throat looks I'm like well what's yeah that's why yeah this the time doesn't end with Trump but let's what's coming and that's why I think when you say like seeing how people react to Trump and stand up and in the streets but to me it's like today they're doing that or they did it this weekend but it's like some point people either they get exhausted by doing that yeah there's a March right now going from Charlottesville to DC to protest you know Trump's that all the things that from said in the wake up walk the whole way yeah yeah people on the way or pick up some I think that's more likely like people economy several days it's like a week-long thing yeah they're gonna walk for several doing right now as we were talking people and I think a lot of times those marches like the hardcore people start first and then I might show up Saturday afternoon hey guys this whole trip all in charlottesville a few days ago but yes man we walked a long way remember that fun adventure we had but there's people right now who are walking from shards well the dizzy because they're like saying we have to sort of keep the pressure on but it's exhausting to do that not everybody can do that I don't know how much it helps cuz I remember the women's March totally unacknowledged he never said a thing about it it's millions of people over the world marching against him yeah people weren't pussy half's Nathan cared you just didn't doesn't seem to respond I think sometimes it's not about like weather the weather the people in power care it's whether the people care and gets the people energized do the next thing hmm so I think that like you know the march on Washington that King didn't you can't go and the next day but you can but it certainly becomes a historical moment that people then look for and it also be it becomes like everybody not there but most people there home tonight we're talking about the women's March right and it and it starts that thing that like it's the same thing with marriage equality like it starts to open up people's brain so like huh man what were they talking about and some people are having bad conversations I mean but it's to me it's like it opens it's long as you keep the conversation going there's a potential for change yeah it just takes time is there's an old expression that comes to gambling and it also can be applied to weight loss and a bunch of other things in life that you get better the same way you got sick like like with gambling like you can't just win it all back yeah you gotta slowly try to chip away and get back in there with weight loss you can't just lose all that weight it doesn't happen like that like yeah how long did it take you to get fat well guess what ya can take you a similar amount of time yeah maybe longer good very well and I think for our culture it's gonna take a while to sort all this out and I think we also have a problem that the the actual operating system that we use this whole representative government that was set up back when you had to take a letter by horse want to get to people yeah like it's really not necessary anymore yeah and it's it creates a lot of red open and creates a lot of bureaucratic inefficiency that I think if we had to if we have no government right now we're trying to structure a government the last thing we do is have one person with incredible amount of power that could also launch the looting in nukes and pardon criminals yeah it wouldn't have that we were put in like the those offices with cubicles that are in a semi-circle probably have like a council presidential council of people people that are like mathematics professors that understand economics and people that understand you know geography and understand cultural differences people that are you know that really understand health care they really understand all the different things we wouldn't make like the Supreme Court a lifetime appointment you would go you know you get it for 20 years yeah you don't you don't and we wouldn't there's no this is the thing wheat I don't think Democrats focus enough on and unless they're doing it in behind closed doors but you would not have the Electoral College no fucking way you would not no nobody can sell it to you and nobody could nobody could tell you why it makes sense now it was important yeah everybody's important but is it more important than anybody else yeah one person one vote man we're just yeah we're living if this is a hoping like every election boils down to like four or five states right and raised like in California by the time the polls close they tell you who won cuz like we know how California voted so then I become a person who's like what's the point of me voting for you know it's like you know so for me electoral college and then gerrymandering where the whole thing where they get to sort of they divide your neighborhood up into a way this fits the you know those are the things that are really that's why it's scary about who comes after Trump because as long as the electoral college exists it automatically sort of tips the country to more sort of right leaning direction you know and and now we just may be fine except when the right becomes Trump you know like you know if it's it's different if it's President John McCain which I'm not a huge town McCain fan but I feel like at least there's a through-line you know we're so for me it's like the Electoral College is never that's why the left has to fight so hard and I feel like if you're not if Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are in hallways right already meetings right now like we fucked this electoral college up we gotta take it down then we're sort of losing the plot of how this works well I don't think it's necessary anymore on this idea that well the people in the middle needed because the people on the co the large population centers they can dictate what yeah people there is that's the actual country yeah yeah there's that that's why they doing cuz grass marker out here fucking our kids in the middle of fields it's not it's not well people do people define is this the most like we have more people like we got more land that's not the same it's all of us we're all supposed to being this thing together and these it would be a way more interesting war or election if everybody knew they're just counting the votes yeah and politics would have to work way harder instead of going well I'm not gonna go talk to people yeah up and down California because that's already set you can think there's an issue with states to I think there's an issue with people voting like we lost California I know will Nevada is gone to jail you know yeah I just think it should be just one lump group of yeah let's all vote on stuff there's good people everywhere there's good people in Iowa there's you have people in Kansas it's good people in California there's you know we got to stop all this divisive nests and I think that's one of the issues that comes along with people I mean there's people that like they have intercity competition right folks acog oh you know like people yeah we get in these teams when it comes to the United States of America when it comes to being the president I did genuinely think we have to look at ourselves as one group of humans well I think we should we feel like that our that each of our voices counts yeah and we're in it together yeah that either all because right now it's like you know for you even these clothes they're delusional they don't have an understanding of the real people of America that voice is horrifying like I was just withered I had like a moment of like what does happen just put my I'll show you how to burn a cross wow you could be like a funny joke to me the funny voice comedian with all this all this other stuff that's funny yeah no that's yeah I think that we because the thing is I like this is one thing I'll say about United shades when I go to the South Side Chicago we didn't have said about gangs and didn't and violence and gang violence in South and West Side of Chicago and I didn't episode Appalachia about like you know but mostly about cold and then in the coal industry it's dying and even people there no yes dying you know they when Trump comes a lot of them cheer like we just meet but where they fearing for his jobs right they're not cheering for coal mrs. Sarah course if you said we have other jobs for you they'll take those jobs right now they do have pride in the culture that coal of the coal culture because it's about their life but they're not doesn't happy that but all I'm saying is people in Appalachia voted for Trump people in Chicago who voted for Hillary are all just worried about jobs and better schools for their kids and safety yeah John yeah it's and so they're nuts and so but when we break it down to this left right it starts to change the conversation when really there is a party in some people say it's a green party but there's a they're up there there is night you could form a party around those ideas and not the where these other parties have gone I completely agree but listen man I love your show I'm glad you're doing it I always love talking in we should do this more often absolutely thanks for coming out brother thanks for tell everybody how they could reach you on social media W kamau Bell on Twitter at W kamau Bell at W kamau Bell calm I want to Instagram on Twitter on Facebook yeah yeah yeah yeah nice great conversation all right fuckers we'll see you tomorrow [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music]
