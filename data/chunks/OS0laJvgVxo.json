his name is Chris Hatfield the book is an astronaut's guide to life on earth hear that that's me I never forget I never remember rather turn my laptop off you are you were in space for 166 days amazing huh that's insane it's it's when I sit on my dock and watch the Space Station go over it's really hard to rationalize because I know I was up there and I can remember all the details but to try and Link in life on earth with with seeing that spotlight go across the horizon it's it's still I haven't got sorted out of my head how to connect it is that the longest a person has ever been up there no we there was a Russian guy named Valery Polyakov who stayed up 14 months straight 400 and whatever that is days long time Wow yeah no I'm nowhere near the record that's instilling 166 days is an incredible amount of time to be detached from gravity and floating around in space what is the effect on your body a big effect short term huge your body doesn't have to lift the blood up to your head when you're weightless right so your whole cardiovascular system changes all the nice little mechanisms that squeeze the balloon that is your body to get the blood up to your head they stop work and your heart gets smaller you start losing your skeleton your balance system completely shuts down I mean it has no stimulus from gravity anymore so you become totally visually based so when you come home it's brutal building all those things back up again and most of them you feel I mean you lose the calluses on the bottom of your feet it's kind of disgusting because your feet are like a snake up there but the bottom of your feet are shedding because you never use the bottom of your feet and you build up calluses on the top because you're always tucking your feet underneath things so when you come back you even have to grow the calluses back at the bottom of your feet and the thing that takes the longest is your skeleton I lost about 8% of the bone across my hips and but it's grown back and within about a year of landing all hopefully be back to normal one year it takes one year for your body to fully recover took about four months before I could run normally again where my body would get the blood out of my feet and pump it properly back up to my head about four months which is almost as long as I was up on this trip but yeah the bone takes the longest but it's it's automatic which is interesting my body got osteoporosis and it's reversing osteoporosis using some internal stimulus that we don't even understand so it makes a pretty good medical study for everybody yeah I would imagine so now how long is how long do you have to be in space before your body loses so much massive skeleton and the first time you take a leak in space your urine is full of calcium and minerals we do you know urine samples all the time and your body we don't even know why we don't know what sensors in the body recognize that you're weightless or why we would even have those sensors but your body starts to shed your skeleton right away and we can almost beat it now through heavy exercise we have a bunch of equipment onboard resistive exercise and treadmill and bicycle and stuff and with that we can almost beat it but we across my hips and my upper femur we haven't been able to load that area up right you always lift symmetrically and on treadmill you always run nice and symmetrically so you don't get all the the banging transverse loads that you need to make your body keep the bones dense there so how much of it can you preserve by using exercise the rest of my body was fine in fact I increase muscle mass I'd increased fat a little bit my bones were at the same density the only place we haven't solved yet is just the hip cradle and I think with another iteration or two of our exercise equipment we'll get that solved and then Demming go to Mars Wow so now how long are you when you're doing like exercise to try to to build up what percentage of your days to live doing two hours a day every day we do one hour of cardiovascular one hour of resistive every single day seven days a week for the whole half a year that you're up there then we've determined that's the best trade-off between getting useful work done you know because it's a big multinational laboratory and keeping your body healthy so we we commit about two hours a day did they when they first started going up there did they not do anything no we've tried a bunch of different things the Russians even try to suit they call a penguin suit which is like a set of coveralls tight-fitting coveralls it's full of elastics so that every time you bend your elbow or move your twist your body or something you're fighting the resistance of the suit because they thought then you could sort of get it for free but but you need to demand it you need to actually heavily force your body to exercise and if you do that and then you can stay in shape but we've you know we started out with resistive exercise device and then it was the improved I read and now we're on a read which is the advanced resistive exercise device as we've learned you know how to make it better so that we we can return to earth healthy or you know when we go to the moon but more importantly when we go to Mars because it takes about half here to get there well where this is one of the problems we need to solve the Mars is really that next level trip right because there's no coming back it's it's like several levels above where we are now station is in orbit right surround us the space station it's been up there 13 years now with people on board but it's like sailing up and down the coast within sight of land you know we haven't had it across the body of water even to go to the moon as far as habitation goes so right now we're just sailing up and down the coast of the world figuring out how to beat osteoporosis how did the radiation the psychology of it what to make the haul out of how do you make a toilet that works at the closed environmental system got to invent all those things then I think we'll go to the moon because it's the next it's only three days away and then we can do how to use resources that are there how do you generate power how do you navigate how do you do all that and then once we get that sorted out then I think we'll go further but it's still you know a lot of years away what one of the big hazards the big has it's a radiation from space micro meteors yep and what else psychological right how do you keep people sane and it's not so bad in the space station because we're close to the world there's only like a two second delay talking on the radio so you can have a normal conversation just a little pause but as soon as you start going to Mars within a couple weeks you will never have another conversation with earth normal again everything's got so much lag that you'll just have like recorded video messages back and forth and so the psyche impact of that is going to be high and the earth will shrink to just another star within a couple weeks you know and that those people will become Martians in the mind you know they will no longer be from Earth they will see themselves as separate when I was on the space station the second time one of the other crew members her name's sue Helms she and I were talking we'd known each other since test pilot school and in passing a throw away thing she didn't think she was saying she said hey you know earth said that we're supposed to do this next and in my mind I heard earth said I heard those words come out of her mouth and it was like she has in her mind completely split off from the other 7 billion people there's her crew and earth is one singular identifiable entity on the other side and that was a real bellringer to me of what it's going to be like to go to Mars those people are going to be a completely discrete unit of people and they'll be Martians they won't be earthlings pretty quick in their heads and how do you deal with that how do we plan for that and it's still a long ways in the future but it's one of the many things we need to sort out before we because as you say once you get the engine's going fast enough that you're you're headed for Mars you can't just turn around there's no coming back that's it well I mean the Apollo 13 right they lost an engine on the way to the moon they coasted all the way to the moon and they just used like like ball on the end of a string they just went around the moon with the gravity the moon to sling them back at Earth again so if something failed on the way to Mars you could do the same thing but it would take a year so you know if no problem can normally last a year to get resolved so pretty much yeah you got to have all the problems solved before you head that way and what about like sustainable resources like as far as like food and things like that do they have to when they have to terraform when they get to mars well we're going for we don't know we're trying to figure all that out a really interesting discovery about three weeks ago curiosity that big Rover that that is driving around on Mars right now has some pretty good equipment on it and it discovered just in the last few weeks that in every cubic foot of dirt on Mars there's a quart of water so there's oceans of water I mean the topsoil is full of water on Mars so that's really promising for when we get there because water is hydrogen and oxygen oxygen to breathe hydrogen and oxygen makes fuel hydrogen oxygen makes water so that's a huge resource the moon there there's water there but it's really rare so that's a big discovery for us eventually being able to go there but you know we need a power source the sun's a long ways away and it's dusty on Mars you can't just you can't have a solar powered bulldozer you know you mean a power source and we need how do you navigate and there's just all how do you build a perfect closed-loop environmental system so that you don't have a constant losses and because of the space station we only I think it's about 92 percent of our water we reclaim but we constantly need that little trickle from Earth of new water because it's not perfect there's there's a whole there's a lot of stuff we need when don't even know what we don't know yet and that's I think why we'll we'll sort a lot of that out on the moon before we launch to Mars to me watching the footage of the rover and the images that it sent back was almost surreal it didn't seem real it's it's it was hard for me to wrap my head around the idea that they sent a robot to another planet it's roaming around taking pictures and sending them back and we're looking at yeah it's phenomenal it's incredible yeah that we could do that and and the way that came to you know Mars has has just the wrong atmosphere it's not thick enough to use a parachute in but it's not thin enough that you can ignore it and just and just slow down and land with a rocket you know it's it's it's not good for landing the Earth's atmosphere is nice and thick you can come down under a parachute and the moon has none so you can just like the Apollo guys you can just land on your rocket plume Mars you're kind of stuck in the middle so you need a complex landing system and curiosity the way they came up with a solution that was just phenomenal the big arrow break through the atmosphere and then that sequence of miracles and the retrorockets and the extendable bridle and everything it is amazing that that worked and a huge kudos to the JPL guys and everybody who came up with it that and the stuff it's teaching us about how planets work and and what is what is the past and the future for that planet Mars and therefore gives us a lot better understanding of what's normal and what what look we can expect on earth yeah huge kudos to those people indeed they did an amazing amazing thing and just one of those in my opinion when those paradigm-shifting moments where when you know we're back here on earth and we're watching those images like wow they can do this now yeah I'm an astronaut I'm an astronaut and you know I've been in space twice and I gathered my family around to watch that thing happen because it's so it is right on the edge of what we can just barely do and such a brave thing to do and such a capable probe a capable extension of us all to put down on the surface and it's teaching us about Mars did you ever pay any attention to the face on Mars or any of that craziness that's or that's all fun and you know there's there's faces all over I mean just lay on your back and look at the clouds there's faces everywhere right that's sure we we naturally look for faces especially in weird shadowy images sharp those images were mean there were some really unique things there's a rock near my house that's a square rock and when I have a friend who believes in a lot of conspiracy theories and not believes and uh the face on Mars and a lot of different stuff and I said I'm gonna show you something man come over here I go look at that rock do you think anybody made that rock I go that rock is just made that's just a rock amongst a pile of rocks it's big and it's kind of square not perfectly square but if you looked at a blurry picture of it that was taken from space you swear this is the building block for a pyramid obviously she's clearly made by an intelligent species same one that built the pyramids yeah I know it's it's always easier to believe something than it is to understand it yeah the fascinating thing about the the face on Mars is not that it looks like a face on Mars it's the idea that Mars at one point in time actually could have sustained some form of life and in fact definitely did it had an atmosphere that was livable at one point in time they really there could have been some kind of life maybe it was just like microbes or plants or might still I mean yeah is the biggest volcano in the solar system so it has heat and it has all this water it's but that we've just found now for sure and heat and water on earth always means life to me and just look under your sink and so on on Mars maybe there's a fossil record of it maybe there's even something still primitive stuff living somewhere in the rock we don't know but we haven't found any yet but if we can find it on Mars and we know this life on earth and there's life everywhere and that would be a pretty important thing to figure out or the possibility that life actually started on Mars and some sort of an impact from an asteroid panspermia Senate hurling towards the earth and I'm not sure that's a logical conclusion you know if if life can start somewhere then it can start in two places all right and so it doesn't have to miraculously beep and sperm ëadd from one planet to another if it formed on Mars then and there's life on Earth then it's a more logical conclusion to think that it just formed in two places I think do you when when you sit in that Space Station and you're floating above Earth much as you were saying that your colleagues started referring to Earth as like a separate individual entity and you guys were separate from Earth did you look out when you're looking at the vastness of everything I mean it's just everything and did it feel like Earth was in a neighborhood more like you know that mean that we weren't isolated that we're it's so silly the thing is so big did you feel like more connected to the rest of the universe in any sort of a way Joe and you're in the side the spaceship and you look at the world you're looking at it through the windows and I came back it was so funny I came back from my first space flight and we sit in the living room with my wife Elena and we were watching Star Trek and they show that scene with Sulu and whoever up front and there's the they were in the standard orbit mr. Sulu and there's the curve of the earth underneath and I remember going that's it that's exactly what it looks like they got that right they guessed right in 1968 or whatever it was because when you're inside the spaceship it looks like that the difference is when you go outside and then you are it's like the difference between sitting in your living room looking outside and hanging on a cliff or you know hanging on half dome or somewhere where it's an entirely different perspective even though it may look at the same thing being outside is is so immersive the world is no longer nicely underneath you like dark like Sulu but it is it is this huge hanging spinning mass next to you and the universe is what's around you and you are you are part of it you're suspended in its way aren't you step in the universe under our feet on all around us and then feeling that you're in it not just sort of below it looking up at it and that is really different and that's when you really see that the world is just in the neighborhood and that it is a ball with the moon being a ball and the Suns over there and if we go out there that's Mars you really get that feeling when you're out on a spacewalk I've heard several astronauts talk about that feeling and that that moment when they are outside of the spacecraft looking at the the universe itself and saying that it changed them forever it gave me a profound respect and also I don't even know I mean nobody knows the answer right Big Bang and all the rest of it and all the all the belief systems around the world and how everybody deals with all that and I sure don't know the answer to that but when you look at the world it's it's really hard to convince yourself that it's random just looking at it it's like how can that possibly be but then again if you look a little further out there's you know how could Mars be random and how could all the other planets how could Saturn the way it looks be just a random event and and the unlimited number of stars that are out there and the planets we're seeing around other stars directly I don't know how to resolve it in my mind I didn't I didn't find the meaning of it all by being on a spacewalk if anything it just deepened my dumbfounded 'no sat the at the immensity of it and our tiny little part of it i've often thought that questions pondering questions like the the randomness of the universe or the the just the the reality that we know about subatomic particles and the idea of the universe being this fractal thing and impossible and never-ending i think it's almost like walking up to a mountain and going yeah i could see how that could be picked up but you can't really pick it up yourself so you're just like man i guess i guess it could be random i don't know I mean what I don't understand I don't even know what the fuck random means the idea of random seems the universe itself seems to be this incredibly complex thing that has not just laws but very clear directions that things move and do it constantly is complexify from the Big Bang til now and the idea of black holes the eating matter and creating a singularity and that possibly these new these new astrophysicists and string theorists guys are saying that they think that inside every black hole may in fact be a completely different universe you know on the top of the space station we have experiment put there by a Nobel prize-winning physicist named Sam ting and it's from CERN from the big particle accelerator that's under Switzerland in France it's their baby and it's up there it's a huge magnet and what it's doing is collecting subatomic particles of the universe and it's it's got layer after layer of detector so I can try and figure out what they all are as they come ripping through and it's collected trillions and trillions of them it's been up there for the last couple years and the reason is we don't know what the universe is made of we can only account for 5% of the universe with the known particles that we have 5 we don't know what 95% of the universe is even made of and so we call it dark energy and dark matter and we're trying to indirectly prove that those exist based on the proportions of the subatomic particles we're collecting up on the top of the space station and it's a decade a long project and they release the first layer of the results back in the spring and it's starting to look like like maybe some of the theories are correct but we're you know we talk as if we're we're conclusively brilliant and we understand everything I mean we're still calling things dark matter and dark energy we have no idea and we're just trying to figure it out that's another word for magic it is indeed it's another word for I don't know what's we we are most certainly the smartest and the most informed human beings that have ever existed as far as we know the two of us know no human bein eying me 100% it but as far as like humans that have ever lived where the the most informed the most technologically capable but much like when we look back at the Renaissance era or we look back at Galileo being in prison because he dared question the idea that the earth was in the center of the universe yeah we're gonna make fun of us someday they're gonna make fun of us like these dummies they didn't know what Clark Walt gluon plasma was they had to use a particle accelerator to prove that the Higgs bosons existed yeah I agree we're gonna look at the space shuttle go what were they thinking I've had station wagon I fig just so ridiculous like a dc-3 now you know that's a one thing I really want to bring up with you you know you you had to take one of those up there you had to take some sort of a spaceship up there what is the feeling like of get did you have to get a Russian one my first two flights were on shuttles I flew Atlantis and then endeavour and then my third flight I was left seat so sort of like the pilot of the Soyuz so I flown them all Wow so you flew when the the Space Shuttle was in operation and you flew the Russian version of the space shuttle what's the difference the shuttle is is so much more capable it is the most capable flying machine humans have ever built unbelievable and three-quarters of everybody who's ever flown in space flew on the shuttle it was the first great lifter its purpose was to take a huge spy satellite up this was the conception in the 60s and early 70s take a hue the best technology 60 spy satellite launched out of Vandenberg goes straight north go halfway around the world take pictures of the hot spots of the world come back again and then use the wings to be able to go sort of sideways and sideslip because the world's turned underneath you and come back and land again after one more bit that's why we had wings on the shuttle was so that we could carry this huge telescope and they weren't automated back then so we needed a crew to be able to operate the telescope that's why the payload Bay was the size that it was and why the shuttle could lift the amount that it could lift it was to meet all those requirements that all immediately stopped being the reason for their Space Shuttle to exist but the design was already set what that gave us though was a vehicle that could carry forty or fifty thousand pounds up in a payload bay that's the size of a city bus and then bring it back and land it gently on a runway and carry a crew up to seven so is like a space station all on its own an amazingly capable vehicle amazingly complex to and and when things are amazingly complex they're really expensive and hard to operate safely and we lost two crews you know as a result of the complexity of it the Soyuz is designed to take three people and a tiny bit of gear up to the space station dock stay there for half a year or longer as their lifeboat and then at the end of time get back in and come back home again that's the Soyuz is purpose and it does that really well but it's tiny and very purpose-built the two of them are magnificent vehicles but built for way different purposes and both very carefully evolved to do what they do you know exquisitely well and I'm lucky to a flown on both that sounds so incredible what is the g-force feel like when you're taking off from the launch pad you go straight up of course you have to get above the air if you want to stay in orbit you got to go five miles a second if you're going a little slower it's it's sort of like throwing something sideways it gravity pulls it down but if you can throw it sideways at five miles a second then gravity will still pull it down but the earth curves away underneath it if it's going fast enough you know it's like goes over the horizon before it falls so that's how we stay in orbit as we go five miles a second but you can't go five miles a second in the air the friction is just too high so the rocket ships take you straight up to get you above the air and that takes about two minutes going straight up and in 45 seconds here through the speed of sound straight up and accelerating and in 70 seconds you're through the altitude and speed of the Concorde accelerating straight up and after two minutes here about 160,000 feet and six times the speed of sound but you're above almost all the air and then your first stage falls off so inside it's this it's this incredibly powerful push in your back like a dragster but like one that's that's gone off the road the vibration of pushing through the air that's it's it's like a tuning fork kind of vibration this enormous powerful jaws of a dog kind of ride straight up but then after two minutes the solids or the X the stage that got you above the air is all out of fuel it explodes off because you don't want to carry all that deadweight with you anymore and then you use the remaining engines for the next six minutes or six-and-a-half to accelerate out horizontal basically to five miles a second and and so for the last six minutes it's like a long liquid drive heavy steady pushing like someone with their fist in your back pushing you faster and faster and faster a smoother ride because you're above the air and after just under nine minutes like 8:45 or so you're exactly the right place the right direction and the right speed the engine shut off and you're in space and you're weightless Wow so it's nine minutes yeah it's eight and 42 on the shuttle and just under nine like 855 for the Soyuz what's the maximum g-force you experienced during that uh the shuttle is about three G and in fact when you hit three G that's what the throttle start coming back because it was only built for about three and a half G so three times your normal weights if we weigh 200 pounds you weigh 600 pounds in there the Soyuz is about four or four and a half so if you a 200 pounder you're up around you know eight nine hundred pounds I got a to ride with the the Blue Angels one of those f-18s once I was an f-18 pilot for a lot of years ah those incredible that's a great airplane you got to fly those yeah what's the most Jeezy pulled in one of those things if you take an f-18 and you grab the stick and you snap it into your lap you aren't actually connected to anything except a computer it's little sensors it's fly-by-wire so it says wow he wants to turn right now and so then it moves all the control surfaces of the airplane but it doesn't want to break the wings off so it will limit you it's it's the airplane limits the amount of G that it can pull and it'll give you about 8g about 8g that's all it'll give you because otherwise you could structurally damage the airplane so there was a paddle you could actually if you were going to hit the ground you could hit this paddle that would override the G control system and snap it in your lap and just give you whatever the aerodynamics would give you and we've had people pull 12 G but but the Soyuz if you come into the atmosphere the wrong way can pull 20 or 22 G on the way home which is just just wicked and that happened once in the Russian and you survive that you're lying down when you're in an f-18 like when you flew with the Blue Angels you're sitting upright so when you pull back it pushes the G the the blood down to your feet so the real limitation is how much of that can you stand before you can't you can't stay awake for your blackout in a Soyuz we're actually laying on our back so the blood doesn't drain out of your head it just gets kind of pushed to the back of your body so therefore you can survive it it won't black you out it doesn't damage you it's it's sort of like a prolonged car crash you know people pull 20g in a car crash but it's instantaneous if you fall into the atmosphere of the wrong way in a Soyuz then as you hit the thick atmosphere it's almost like crashing into something super high G peak for maybe 30 seconds and then then you come through that GP can slow down and it's survivable but I would want to write it Wow that feeling must be just incredible what what are the thoughts that are going through your mind when you when you're going that fast shooting up into space I was funny and I'm focusing on the job because there's a million things that can fail and and one of the mantras of astronauts is there is no problem so bad that you can't make it worse so so we think of a dad all the time and so we we really are careful in the way up and so a big part of you is involved with that but another part of you is just it's just loving the ride so much and I found after a while that my cheeks were hurting and I was like why is my face hurt and I realized cuz this smile this big stupid smile was of my face so much so my cheeks were cramping up cuz because it was so much of a thrill that's a go means and yeah it was like heaven you know one want those two people on your shoulders one that's being all serious and one that's yelling bad advice to you the one that's having a good time is good we old I just love on the ride it is so much fun well I guess that's a good time to do that right because you're completely helpless actually enjoy it you're not helpless at all yeah you're you're there's all sorts of stuff that you're responsible for on the way up on the way down even in the Suez window right down on this we get the full control panel and there's stuff you have to do oh you have to do as it's happening oh yeah what do you do why like while you're flying up well if everything works markedly we're just watching and in same in the shuttle we have very you know hopefully don't have to do anything but sometimes things don't go right and then you got a bunch of things you can do you know various shutdowns and aborts and people probably don't know but the shuttle as it launched up the east coast to the US we kept abort landing runways all the way up to coast you could land at Cherry Point you can land in New York you could land in newfoundland or all those places and so as you're ticking up the coast you're constantly going okay if we have a failure now we're going to abort this way we're going to turn Oregon and land of Bermuda we're going to land here we're going to land and and you know practice those like crazy and then you get to a certain point and then you would land in North Africa or South France or in Spain and all those windows all those tick points all those thresholds you have to get your word that's what we're hyper aware of or not we're not along for the ride Wow so while this is all going on you have this big giant smile and you still are calculating oh yeah still going okay if it screws up now I go here oh yeah run my thumb down a long list of all the various wickets that you're jumping through yeah you pay attention how much of the the trip is automated how much of it is manual we'd like it to be as automated as possible because if it's if that means things are predictable and things didn't break and for the vast majority of shuttle flights and Soyuz flights its automated but sometimes it's not on the way uphill and we've had engines fail or engines start to fail had to shut engines down and go to backup or at least a reserve configuration of the engines you get mid launch yeah during watch that happen on a couple shot to happen on Apollo as well on the way back to earth we've had serious problems with the Soyuz where you have to take over and try and fly manually or come in ballistically which means it loses its ability to steer on the way home and you just start spinning the vehicle and then it just comes in like like a peer meteorite you pull about eight or nine G on a ballistic entry and that's that's that's pretty tough after six months of weightlessness too suddenly if you're a 200 pounder now you weigh 1600 or 1700 pounds and that's that's that's pretty hard on the body Wow it's incredible the feeling that you must have had when you actually stepped onto ground again what was that like it's awful it's an awful here you're so nauseous and dizzy and and the reason is of course your vision is telling you one thing telling you where the horizon is where up is but your inner ear which normally when your eyes are closed keeps you from falling over you know you can close your eyes and not fall over that has forgotten completely what to do with gravity because you've been weightless for whatever five or six months so now you have this sudden great violent disagreement between what your eyes are saying and what your inner ear is saying it's like if you spin 50 times and then stop spinning and you stagger around so your body says well there is something seriously wrong why is his vision so wildly different than his inner ear and for the last million years one of the probable causes was you ate something poisonous you ate some sort of neurotoxin or something that is messing up your internal systems and it might kill you so the first thing your body makes you want to do is throw up because it's trying to get rid of whatever it was you just ate and then the next thing your body makes you want to do is go lay down and go to sleep because so you stop metabolizing it right it's trying to keep you alive so when you first get back from space your body's just screaming at you to throw up and go hide down but you know you've got all this stuff to do and people are there to meet you and then you're trying to just ignore those symptoms and pay attention to what you know what's going on it's is there happiness along with that I mean is there a feeling of being home oh yeah yeah all three of my flights and if the flight went well and we work hard enough that they almost always do there's a great sense of satisfaction because we just it's like the final step in an extremely complicated process where you have done everything right or enough things right that that you can you can like kind of have that for the rest of your life so there's a there's a tremendous feeling of of joy and pride and accomplishment and when you get back to earth I have always been fascinated by space and if you look up you see the lights here are covered with ice on it I like I like your life stars are good but what what drives me nuts is how little we actually get to see of the stars because of light pollution I was uh at the Big Island and I went to the Keck Observatory yeah and there's the there's a station like there's the words that the telescope is and then below that at like nine thousand feet there's like this visitor station have you been I've been near there up and up at the top of a couple of the mountains there to have a look at the sky it's incredible yes we I was I was when we were driving up there I was worried that it was too cloudy I was like oh this is gonna be terrible you know I we wanted to go and see the stars and we picked a cloudy night but we drove through the clouds and then when you get above there and you realize that the entire Big Island they have special diffused lighting to make sure that they don't emit light pollution the view is life-changing it must be like one one-millionth of what you experience on the space station but for me it was a real life-changing moment I'll never forget it and I think about it all the time whenever I look at the stars I always think about that night in Hawaii that's what it looks like but but even crazier there's uh there's an image of it up there yeah but even crazier when you're actually experiencing you can see the Milky Way and I remember thinking God we have to figure out a way to stop light pollution because I think just that just being able to look up and see that would change people's perceptions and would probably make people way more enthusiastic about space people you know of course the vast majority of people live in cities and the places that have the worst light pollution of the city site is similar experienced here is when I was an f-18 pilot would get it up to high altitude you know going on across country especially in the North put on the autopilot and shut off every light in the cockpit and let my eyes adjust and you're already up at 40 45 thousand feet and so there's almost no atmosphere above you and you can see the texture of space you can see the I mean the Milky Way you can see why it's called the Milky Way I mean it's it's a white grey white part of the sky you know and you don't need a telescope to see it you can see it with your eyes I don't need some special time-lapse photography so it it it's both humbling and and really inspiring I think to see puts everything into perspective but I don't know even if you try and work on light pollution people are indoor creatures and cities and they have street lights and they drive around in cars and I don't know how you get people to notice the universe around them I think would help if they could just see it you know it start if you look up in Los Angeles go what do you say yeah I got a star I lived in Houston yeah for a long time and yeah I look at that I could see a teen stars tonight it's a real midnight Carolee but when you're up there and then the observatory and I'm sure when you were at 40,000 feet in the jet it must have been amazing yeah yeah it's it it's not that much further away I mean the Big Island Mountain is not all that high no but you just need one sometimes one small step and you can see a whole new thing yeah I had uh some similar but not quite as intense viewings in the mountains above Boulder Colorado so I could 8500 feet up there was beautiful too but I think that we we forget that we're really in space as stupid as that sounds people really do forget so I was going around the world and my son who ran the social media for the flight to a large degree sent me a note saying hey Dad Mount Etna is erupting you know in southern Italy have a look at Mount Etna so I'm a good dad took a picture of Mount Etna but seeing the the superheated lava and the smoke and the steam coming out of the earth was a really especially when you're looking at the world as a ball was a really clear reminder of the fact that most of the planet is super heated lava and magma and we're so hot that the rock is liquid and plastic right and and we just live on this little chilled crust like like the top of a porridge pot you know and we just live on this little thin bit at the top that is crust and when you tip it the other way around and look up half of the atmosphere is in the first three miles three miles you know think about you people go for a three-mile run you know it that and half really the whole habitable atmosphere is three miles above 15,000 feet it's hard to even live and yeah we live in beats on this little bit of cooled crust and this little sliver of air and we think it's guaranteed we think it's we think we're invincible right and we think the whole universe is here to serve us and we're like we're like bacteria in a corner you know just just found a little niche that will support our life so much so that we're willing to almost are in entire system as far as energy is based on burning things uh yeah that's exact face of releasing if you talk about a hundred years from now looking back and going what were we thinking I mean golly I mean you can see why a five-gallon pail of gasoline is an amazingly enabling thing you can stick it in your car and drive hundreds of miles you know and you can carry it in your hand and it's fairly stable it's a very seductive fuel but at the same time it has such consequences and when we look when we figure out the next energy source when we look back hopefully in a couple hundred years we will go what were we thinking hopefully yeah we seem that it's really hard for people to change to once once we have a pattern that we follow yeah it's very difficult especially if we found a way to make it work for ourselves yeah yeah in spite of all the pollution we still rock it that way in spite of all the stuff that we throw into the ocean we just you know still kind of happening basically on a daily basis well you can't yeah once you built a structure it's real hard to change of course and you can't just suddenly starve means of people or killed millions of people just because you decide to change energy sources it has to be gradual and we will be weaned fossil fuels but they got to get a lot more scarce before we're going to bother just because of its human well the ultimate use of fossil fuels is a rocket I mean that's the ultimate display of it shooting into space with a giant plume of fire behind you it's a brute force way I mean it and we're burning dinosaurs to get to space but it's it's so far it's the only way we figured out how so far it's the only way now when you you think about like what's possible for the future when they start talking about all these different propulsion methods that will someday be available what what if any of them appear viable yeah you're asking me to predict physics inventions of the future which gosh I I wish I could do that I'd go I'd do it tomorrow I don't know to me the obvious answer is every single molecule that exists every complex molecule and atom was put together in a blast furnace of a place with almost unlimited heat and pressure which is the center of a Sun and it's toward that energy in every single atom and molecule that exists and we have yet to find a good way to get that energy back out but there there is more energy in a pencil you know if you if you could truly get the energy that's inside all of the molecules that are in there there's it there's so much energy stored there you know we have like wood that's stored sunlight right and we by burning it we can release that stored solar power even nuclear but we haven't found a clean way to to release the energy to gives us nuclear power we can do it but we're still you know we're kind of cavemen about it and we haven't got it a clean way so I'm certain that at some point we will figure out how to whether it'll be cold fusion or just fusion itself but if you read what they're doing in the various laboratories around the world even the experts think well we're probably 50 years away from from being able to contain fusion so that it becomes a net positive power source and but you know when the experts are saying it's 50 years until we can do it who knows there was a recent article in one of the science magazines that the volume of nuclear waste could be reduced by 90% that they've shown that they can mix plutonium contaminated way with blast furnace slag and turn into glass and it reduces its volume by 85 to 95 percent and effectively locks in the radioactive plutonium creating a stable end product huh I've always felt like I mean the nuclear waste thing is a huge issue obviously I mean they've done a lot of weird things like dig holes in the ground and buried in their Nevada and you know and what's going on now and Fukushima is very disturbing they're trying to figure out how to contain it sure coming up with all these different ways but it's a fascinating thing about human innovation if their backs are up against the wall those crazy monkeys I figure out a way to fix things yeah and it's just our nature necessity is the main mother and we need sometimes we don't think we have the necessity and yeah nuclear waste is a big problem of you know fossil fuel waste is a huge problem as well and neither of them are perfect even solar energy has waste you know because of you have to build all the solar panels and you have to collect all the rare earth metals none of it's for free we have to find as best to trade-off as we can and and still be able to try and sustain as good a standard of living for as many people around the planet as possible and in we've done we I mean we feed more people now than we ever have right but but how how do we do it in the future how do we get better at it I'm not sure there's so many variables obviously and but I'm always very excited when I see something like this that is like my faith in the crazy cuman's has been restored like these these nuts have figured out a way to fix an issue or at least reduce an issue significantly as much as 90 plus percent yeah the the the fossil fuel thing to me is is a weird one because obviously little I enjoy it we use it it's so important for almost everything we do but obviously this is going to create a problem someday and there's no better example for that for me then you know the automobile pollution or pollution that you get from jet airplanes on a daily basis how much it mean the there's a big impact in the environment every time the Space Shuttle gets launched isn't it well compared to everything else it's well and of course spatial is retired but we only flew the spatial at 130 five times I mean you couldn't even measure compared to everything else the pollution that it injected if it had gotten to the point where it was like air travel yeah we wouldn't want you know thousands of those launching every day you know but that wasn't it wasn't a possibility and wasn't what it was gonna do but compared to just you know how we burn coal to generate electricity and how we use cars to transport ourselves around the you know there are 40 what 42 thousand people are killed just in car crashes mmm you know that is a it's a societal norm in the United States we expect that we say that's okay it's all right to kill 42,000 people so we have the freedom to drive our cars around wherever we want kind of an interesting level of accepted disaster you know we just say that's okay and that's not that's not some global warming problem that may manifest itself on our children that's a guaranteed thing this year and and that's just an interesting thing to hold up the mirror and look at yourself and say okay that's that's what we decide is alright there's also a matter of a very statistically significant number of years of your life that you lose by living in a smog-filled environment that's a fact sure and we don't think about that because you can survive and be healthy in New York City you know you can go jogging down the streets of Manhattan and you know drink spring water and think everything's all groovy but the reality is if you're living in a city and you're breathing in those fumes on a daily basis it will reduce your life period yeah but but yeah I agree with you but none of us are lasting forever and people live where they want to live for all the reasons and only one of the variables is how many years are going to live there right would you rather live in the middle of nowhere where the air is clean but there's no people to talk to or and the theater is really bad theater is always bad let's be honest what's the best theater even nearly as good as the best movie starving closed and antiquated goofy art form um okay here I have to ask you about these guys yep aliens uh-huh that that little alien guy Sam yeah when you're up there when you're in space I mean do you ponder the possibility and is that something you ever wondered yourself are there intelligent life forms out there and if so do you think that they watch us do you think they're aware of us you mentioned earlier that with Galileo inventing the telescope he was you know tortured for pointing out that we weren't the center of the universe and with every invention that's come since then we've been able to prove more and more conclusively just how far from the center of the universe we are and also how huge the universe is and billions of years old and more vast the numbers are so big they're they're incomprehensible both in numbers of stars and number of galaxies and within the last few years using the great great grandchildren of Galileo's telescope we are seeing planets directly seeing planets around the nearby stars and we've seen thousands of them so we've basically shown that every single star has planets and so there's an unlimited number of planets out there and so to think that with an unlimited number of chances that we are the only life in the universe to me is just a natural extension of thinking that we're the center of the universe you know it's an arrogance egotism thing based on belief instead of fact but it's also I think arrogant and egotistical to think that we're so fascinating and we're so revelation Airy and and so special that somehow weird big black eyed monsters with no hair on their bodies are sneaking around staring at us because we are so special to me that's just I mean it's fun science fiction and it's makes for great entertainment but it's it's not real well I've heard that the archetype of the the doctor the alien with the large black eyes and the the you know this strange big head that what it may very well come from is that the actual birth experience for children the first time the eyes are outside of the womb they don't have clear vision and they see the bright light of the operating room which is the first time they've ever been exposed to something like that and it's incredibly traumatic experience they recognize the eyes which are enormous in front of the head the this this face with a white mask on it featureless interesting and that this is most likely what the archetype of the experience the these medical experiments that supposedly go on with these aliens that that's the origin of it and it's well we have this very arrogant idea that children don't remember things yeah you know and it's been my point about circumcision that was like I don't think circumcision is a good idea I think it's ridiculous I think it's antiquated it's genital torture and I think the justification is one of them is that the baby doesn't remember it yeah and I'm always like how do you know the baby doesn't remember just because they don't have a point of reference or context it's very possible they remember it well this scientific answer to the alien abduction experience and these cold hard medical examinations use emotionless medical examinations may very well just be the birthing process or sort of some of it or certain both and then the you know the incredible feeling of helplessness that they have is basically their body doesn't move yet and that these intense memories are burned deep deep deep into our consciousness I think it also just comes from a fear of being alone and a fear of being immortal mmm and if we can somehow convince ourselves that neither of those two things are true then it's a great comfort to folks and to think that that there's other life out there and it's it's it's it's holding us as super special and it's been here before and it's going to be back it's it's a nice seductive thought process to go down so but there is there I mean we have left earth we have 13 years ago this month we permanently started living on the space station with the International Space Station program and the Soviets have been there for decades before on their space stations we have sent probes to every planet in the solar system and got one going up to Pluto right now and we're Rovers on a couple different three different planets and moons of the solar system we if aliens did show up I don't think their behavior would be the one that is in the common science fiction media you know it just doesn't make sense so so I am convinced there's life in the universe you know just on the statistics of it it just makes sense it's it's it's just egotism to think that we're that special but I think it's also just he catism to think that we're so special that were the object of great secretive fascination by higher beings well I think you're very humble and so you look at us and say that it wouldn't be that interesting but I say to you imagine if we found out that there was a planet just outside of our solar system where there were some people that were there they were just like human beings but there were like human beings from like the 1300s yeah they just hadn't figured anything out yet we would be like holy shit they have guns they figured out the wheel their light and their cities on fire they're crazy they just haven't figured out mass communication yet most of them can't read I think we would be as a lot like us right now actually a lot like us right now we really haven't changed that much but I mean if we found some people just from a thousand years ago a thousand years in our past we would be absolutely incredibly fascinated I think if we found some being somewhere that had harnessed the power of fire if we went back 40,000 years ago I think we'd find it incredibly fascinating so the stuff that we can do I don't buy it I think if I was an alien I would be so fascinated by these freaks these pink monkeys with bang sticks and the internet and religions and all the the freakshow stuff that we have down here on earth I think we would be the most wonderful freak show of all time I've often said that if there is if there is intelligent life in the earth that I think or outside of Earth I think that earth is probably the Tijuana of outer space which explains why all visitations come in the middle of the night they're just they're hammered and they want to see a show they want to go see the freak show I think if I was an intelligent being I do not buy the idea what would be so special about human beings where do we start okay there's a lot special about this crazy species above all other species on this planet there's seven billion of them okay they're like rats on a sinking ship they inhabit every little spot in the ocean find a little floating thing poking out of the ocean where some plants are growing on it boom is a whole whole sea of people living there you know go to Hawaii this little tiny spot it's a million people on Oahu we're crazy yeah I think I would look I think I would we got to go there we got to go to I think we would be probably one of the most fascinating things to observe because we're so incredibly advanced and yet so contradictive so so hypocritical so ridiculous so easily led so easily tricked and fooled we have access to instant information but yet we choose to believe some of the most ridiculous things of all time yeah I agree with you though that I find the evidence of us being contacted by aliens incredibly uncompelled and the people that I talk to I did a sci-fi show called Joe Rogan questions everything where I met with a lot of these UFO guys and I felt like I was talking to religious fanatics yeah it's just like talking to a religious fanatic it's just they feel like they're too clever for the Quran so they fall for the Blue Book Project Blue Book is there their Lord so two weeks ago a satire paper in Canada published a thing about what I did at a movie theater watching the movie gravity and I said I heckled it and I thought I heard about yeah and I farted to protect you know protest the movie and all this stuff and got thrown out of the theater that's really rude I thought it was very funny right read this article thousands of people believed it and sent notes and friends send it to their friends and hey look hey look hey look this is this must be the truth because I believe it and that thinking is so easily prevalent and and dominates a lot of populist conclusion making when in fact it's not based on fact at all because people want to believe stuff but they don't want to spend any time actually doing the thinking or the research about it and so you know that that's pervasive right across all cultures including what people think about you know alien abduction yeah that it's also a real problem with the access to information right now so beautiful anybody can get information at any time but it's not vetted so and there's also a lot of what they call satire sites which are just not satire they just lie right I mean there's there's been there's this one national news something another website that people keep constantly tweeting me stories from and they just make up stories sure there was one about that i retweeted before I read where it came from that Texas decided to use sexual predators for medical experiments and there's but there's just it's just a lie there's no it's like if you read the onion within five minutes or five seconds you realize okay they're doing comedy right this is funny right I'm business humorous they they're not being humorous or just lying and they're calling it satire when you see that attributed to you like farting in a movie theater that's rude and I've read it and I had it sent to me like this guy's an asshole like he farted in the movie it made me laugh but all the reaction to it made me laugh as well it's just like come on people please we get a week we are actually so separate from the one celled organisms we have brains and reason and experience and logic and use it we're clearly still developing clearly right I mean there's yourself and everybody well you were this folks like you that have experienced technology and innovation at its very height they the the highest highs you've actually gone out above the the actual atmosphere of our earth and you've experienced the amount of technological sophistication it takes to pull something like that off but then there's other folks that are barely there chimps with a language and they exist amongst us because of this complex society it makes it really easy for dumb people to just get by and breed and make more dumb people it's so it's so easy yeah so you got to have that right is this the yin and the yang of life you know I think the real key to it is what does everybody want to get out of it what do you want to get out of your life and what do you think impulsions what what is it that that gives you the satisfaction at the end of the day and it may be that stuff you've read on the internet or maybe the television show that you watch or maybe the sports team that you idolize or it may be some new invention somewhere or some area your huge belief into some particular subset of what we know or we don't know and to me that's all great everybody should be doing that as long as they're pushing themselves to something that they're interested in they're trying to you know get the best out of the things that they're naturally inclined towards and make the most of it it's it's just been what I've been doing I'm just interested in this particular part of spaceflight and and I'm caesura is fine by me live and let live but don't spend all of those efforts in taking your particular set of interests and your beliefs that that have given you this area and trying to force them on other people make them good for you offering them up for other people to believe if they like but then but don't don't try and convince everybody else in the world that there UFO's just because this is what you believe don't why would that become your your you know your mantra why would it be so important I think it's just like people that want people to convert to Islam they just have this idea in their head that this is the truth and they have to pursue it it's just like a religion I think that the religion of belief you know the the the the intensity of ideology once you there's I know people that want you to be on AT&T because that's their network you know like when you do with Verizon school AT&T there's a weird Klan thing that human beings have and Blackberry versus iPad and the people that believe in aliens they all stick together they go and they have conferences and it becomes a part of their culture it's fun and there's this thing that happens this confirmation bias where they don't want to look at anything outside of something that confirms their idea they don't want to look at it objectively I think having a belief system is important did you see anything up there anything weird having the lights of the world is really weird to look at and fascinated look at and the storms around the planet and the end the I mean I was out on a spacewalk going through the Southern Lights you know with the with the aurora on this case aurora australis coming up underneath my feet for a thousand miles and that is a weird thing to see it's beautiful it's fascinating it's it doesn't green real it mostly what you see in pictures is green because that's what the cameras see but in reality it's it's got red and orange and yellow coming out the top of it that your eyes can pick up and it's it's you can't believe it's real like how can this possibly be earth how can this be going on all the time it's it is phenomenal to see especially when you can see for several thousand miles and it's under your feet it's a it's amazing to see so yeah we see amazing stuff all the time yeah that's way cooler than some dork and a flying saucer the kid doesn't even have he doesn't even have the the manners to come and say hi he's got a circle around abduct you and erase your memory so me the world is fascinating and unknown and interesting enough with helping to invent little green men visiting it really is and it the awareness of how fascinating it truly is is greatly enhanced by people like you so I want to thank you very
