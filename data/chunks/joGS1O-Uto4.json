hello hello Joe happy new year happy 2020 happy 2020 that doesn't sound real 2020 sounds like a fake number like we're in the year 2020 that's like a movie about the future yeah we've already gone past the Bladerunner date you know I was the Blade Runner did I think that was September October night last year you know what's interesting about the estimations about the future no one ever over asked our underestimates everyone overestimates right like space 1999 remember that show yep that was a I'm older than you but when that show was on TV people thought that in 1999 we just fucking flying around through space all the time and living out there yeah like Buck Rogers yeah all those all those shows like so Blade Runner was what year this last 16 19 Wow they missed that yeah yeah cuz it's funny when they show it in the movie it shows like the background looks like like like flying cars and like crazy you know billboards and everything I wonder where technology would be if it wasn't for the Internet imagine of the internet was not possible but technology still advanced electronically like the capability of you know showing higher resolution images and processing power and all that stuff kept moving but they never figured out how to link it all up yeah that's weird that's the scariest thing about the Internet it's almost like they put like the future put ideas in people's heads and those people just started figuring out a way to connect everybody and then connect all this crazy computing power and all this information you could translate it in real time and do it all around the world and the what what a better way to get the technology to advance because if it wasn't for the internet how much where would we be at realistically but still be racist would still be molesting people at work nuclear bombs it's still a radio it's still FTD yeah cuz that's what's causing all the problems you know in Hollywood and everything in life and you know look at all the stuff that's going on right now with the Trump and everything like that like it's the internet getting together going no this is wrong this is right it's people like becoming gangs immediately I think it's a side effect of something that's ultimately gonna be good that's what I think I think we're learning how to figure it out but I think ultimately it's gonna be good because what it is is like everybody gets to have an opinion and through those opinions you find out which ones make any sense which ones are crazy in which but like right now it's like the people that are really into expressing their opinions on both sides are usually the ones that like than everybody else is like hey hey hey fuckin relax man like what isn't it I think most of us have some sort of a middle ground on almost everything but that's not represented right now because right now it's like the most extreme people are the ones who are putting the most energy into talking about things like this Greta thern burn girl do they have to go to her every time anybody says anything wrong about the climate because apparently meatloaf said something would it mean leave say something about her specifically I think he said did he yeah oh I thought he had a client I wrote the headline I read and I'm a fucking sucker for clickbait has said he had climate denial comments yeah he just said something like relax he pretty much like kind of did that that passive-aggressive thing like chill out lady it's probably being funny yeah that's what we do he took well I did feel kind of bad for it I think it's hilarious that like imagine all the other girls in school what did they think about her you know like I have a friend who worked with autistic people and she said she thinks she's autistic she she thinks that this situation is like a really bright child that maybe is being like pushed in this direction to be this public figure it's just her it's not that her opinions aren't valid they definitely are valid but it's just it's not healthy to take a young kid who's developing and then thrust them into the front of something like global climate change debate it's so hostile and then just instantaneously this kid is getting mocked and fuck with and then they're asking her to make statements and and how dare you that how dare you just plays over and over and over again like she's not wrong it's not wrong her opinions but it's like she's really young to handle this I don't know if she's autistic she seems very very smart is she like this all day that's good question a lot like when you think of autism don't you like almost immediately think they're probably really smart at something oh yeah apps is that from brain man or is that accurate no that's accurate that's why the government uses them to for their military for like radars and stuff they're very smart at one certain thing or a few certain things you know inaccuracy is another one that I think a lot of them are smart at do one time when I was really high I had a crazy thought about autism and that all these spectrum disorders are eventually going to make emotions like a less significant aspect of being a human being you know some people some people they don't have any control over their emotions right they're just they fly off the handle they're nutty they cry they scream it's varies right with all of us we didn't be like more efficient if that wasn't the case anymore like if it was a like like an appendix you know we had an appendix we had a organ that we used to use to prot was it like processing roots and shit or bark bone was it bone yeah if I was like breaking down bones something we don't use anymore because of our diet change like imagine if your emotions become something like that like some people have emotional flare-ups like other guy blew out his appendix he just had a fucking hissy fit at his brother's wedding fuck no fuck you man dad always fucking said which one of the pillows it's an extra prozac makes you just numb to like thoughts is an accent yeah I think xanax is the anti relax that one prozac's of speed right or anti-anxiety one xanax is anti is I think so yes like just pure xanax all the time like somebody told me that way you take that when you get off of it it accentuates the anxiety like once you get out this little rubber band effect but then a doctor told me that's horseshit so I'm gonna go with the doctor but so many people maybe it's because they forgot how bad anxiety is and then they get it back like fuck and you're like maybe because you took a break and you you know what it's like the night have anxiety then the reality of being on the natch this is even more discomforting a lot of people take xanax to come down from Bad trips or like if they get too stoned or to butt fucked up on mushrooms or small have you done sanic no no no but I didn't even know that I had a problem with anxiety until I started taking CBD oh yeah once I started taking CBD oil I was like wow I feel great how much see like what what's your normal CBD like what do you take I do a lot lotions Oh take pan I use a bunch of different companies and a bunch of different kinds of stuff some of them are gummies but mostly I like oil and CBD MD is one of the sponsors they sent me a bunch their stuff it's great well I just court it under my tongue yeah like I just chill out it just does something to you where it's not getting you high but it is giving you like this feeling of lightness there's a little bit just a little bit just a little relaxed and it's you know Dave Foley had really fucked up arthritis in CBD tincture CBD oil completely fixed it just oral CBD he used to not be able to straighten his fingers out just from what fucking arthritis yeah I used it on my leg when I pulled my sciatica or whatever that shit's called and I helped with that actually dude I've done that many times sciatica I've never done that that was one of the worst things ever man I couldn't sleep you know what it is it's most of the time it's an injury in your back and it goes down your leg right but what it is is your back somewhere in your back I'm like an expert on being able to butcher scientific explanations from medical conditions but right if else given do my best to get it right I would say it's your disc bulges out and hits the nerve and it hurts and the way it hurts it goes down your leg so you think like you pulled some in your leg but it's really something in your back you know and I was experiencing it really recently man and I went and got you know what Regina keen is I told you about that shit before it they used to do it in Germany they was a blood spinning proceeded they still do it in Germany but now they do it in Santa Mon and it's a blood spinning procedure that's like platelet-rich plasma but they put some other stuff in it we've I know we've discussed the science behind it anyway it's amazing at that and like relaxing all the area around a disc and anything that's bulging sort of goes back in and fixes itself it really can't happen like you don't necessarily have to get surgery with a lot of people but some people that have your situation or my situation to get surgery because the the discs keeps poking out they said we're just gonna cut a piece out on and it can it can help you I think mine might might be stemming from my bad knee somehow because mine - right after I injured my knee again the other yeah you're my favorite on you you know it's definitely weaker like I needed is that the the growth hormones you have to have to go to like not growth with the baby dead baby juice stem cells stem cells do you say have to go to like Mexico for that or no you can do in America for sure and as an added bonus they'll do it maybe get out of your own fat right yeah bro the lipo you a little bit get them to sculpt you some six-pack but have a lot let's see you at the store you'll be like 150 pounds what happened Redman stem cells yeah I got us for everybody who needs ten cells and I didn't even know that you couldn't use plasma I always sold plasma I didn't know you could that keep it and use it for good well this platelet-rich plasma again I'll fuck this up royally if I try to actually explain it but they take your blood out and they spin it and somehow another by spinning it it separates through a centrifuge it separates like this yellow stuff that's like there's the platelets and there's this other stuff like that there's like significant parts to blood alright so they take this platelet-rich plasma how are the fuck they do this and the difference between that like regular PRP androgenic een is some other factors so they squirt that yellow serum into your back it's not cheap it's not covered by insurance but goddamn does it work I mean it works way better than I mean it's like you got a Belgian like if usually if you have a bulging disc you're kind of fucked you know cuz people are like god damn what can I do and they go well exercise yoga there's some things they take a long time you can slowly get things better you can get an epidural that'll kill the pain sometimes that helps relax everything but this shit fixes it that'll be a good company to invest in you just need a doctor in the machine did like it's a little more complicated now I need actual scientists lab technicians it might be just a spinning machine it takes plasma and makes it a like a latte out of it Jamie what were you gonna tell me about Epstein right before the show started three stars I woke up to seeing you last night during the Golden Globes was going on there was some jokes going on by Ricky Gervais so we probably talk about later but 60 minutes was probably going on a different channel at the same time and they had a report with some new evidence that nobody has seen yet they have some autopsy photos and photos from inside his cell yeah all the photos online of course I didn't know this was just release I saw this last night and I saw one of the photos and it looks real so I watched the 15 minutes that they put together which is mostly just about like the incident in the in the cell and surrounding it I'm just gonna show you the pictures up because we can't watch their thing let me try to get the 13 images they're all am I scared no I mean it's just I'm scared already I'm scared already because of Iran I don't want to be scared of this video of them whacking this dude you know they whacked it yes honey that's a hundred percent the fact that they thought they can get away with that that's so crazy like that is such a crazy thing to try to get away with this gigantic international case hey what happened to the cameras all over the fucking broke man I don't know sucks hung himself it need a couple days to make the videos and stuff like that right right yeah exactly that's the price of a fake he tried to hang himself before I know okay don't do that again hey go wrong they won't give me my belt cue my shoelaces give me whatever the fuck that guy strangle me with these photos are all fake right I mean I don't know why it's they're very real they say to Eddie Bravo in here immediately okay here here we go so this is it from his cell this is inside there please up on the screen so this was the cell he was in by himself okay I said he used a bunch of these orange jumpsuits which I guess are already in there he tied them around his head I guess there's a there is a little like spot way up here on the top of the crate where the window is where you could see maybe there was something up there but the thing to remember here is that he was about six foot tall 185 pounds there's one other thing like on this ladder here there is also some other things I'll get into in just a second that would be easier to use than tying all this shit together but this showed there's the other thing here was this this was about four feet off the ground and they do show a noose which they're saying was what he used but as the doctor sort of said that the noose of this show picture which is what you can see in the top right corner here just playing news oh that's dr. Michael badan that's that guy from the HBO autopsy show for some reason I can't I'll find it in a second but the picture that shows his actual neck doesn't seem like this noose caused that wound and it's a little bit lower than it probably should have been oh Jesus so they're showing some of these other this is some of the pictures I had this is the the bone his jaw the Hawaii Willie oh boy leo bones jaw was broken well there is that fracture that they said it wasn't consistent with hanging it's more consistent with a murder homicide and he said this is Baden swards is that usually he's seen it and maybe like one bone break and sometimes two but there were three fractures he says like he's almost never seen that in any of his cases he's ever looked over hmm and you would think it would be if you're gonna hang yourself from such a short distance it would be even harder to get a fracture like that right cuz you're not like jumping out like in an old western movie like Clint Eastwood movie when they would hang them hang them high so the one thing that they also had in here was he left a note oh Jesus the note said like there was like four things it said first that the summit had the name blurred out but it said this person left him in a shower for an hour it then said someone else gave them like burnt food and then bugs were crawling over his hands and then he just wrote no fun but there's a ballpoint pen like the one I have in my hand sitting right next to it like if you knew he was on suicide watch you wouldn't give him a ballpoint pen that he could kill himself with shame it you should be a goddamned attack well this is what they're saying he had assess his sleep apnea machine was in there it was though you could see an extension cord coming from the hallway into his room that he could have just used that to kill himself and hang more than jumpsuits why does he have 9 jumpsuit a jumpsuit things with freaky like they're trying to explain it by bringing in some some new witnesses somehow this is actually a different video that's showing a couple different things than what I saw this morning I didn't see this arm thing and I didn't see the pictures but the arm thing looks like an injection spot is that what it looks like I guess it here's the actual this is why so here's the note what does this say it's at 60 minutes get their water marshal it's so funny sorry 60 minutes thank you thanks for getting this assistant kept me in a locked it's blurbed right here says the names board kept me in a lock shower stall for one hour neck or someone I don't know the name send in burnt food giant bugs crawled on my hands and then no fun and then they're saying in any code end up but then this ballpoint pen was next to it that he could have stabbed myself the neck or what everything yeah it's hard to kill yourself with a pen yeah but do they get pens that's not usually but this is like a you know high profile Carroll's right yeah I know it's just my look it's so it's bad to say either way if you don't know and I'm guilty of that a hundred percent I'm like that guy didn't kill himself I am talking shit oh I'm not talking in terms of like we have to understand this is really important we're we're doing a podcast when you're doing a podcast you don't have to be factually accurate you just have to talk shit and hopefully if you fuck up you correct it and it's funny I'm not a science expert but when these guys are saying that the guy died by strangulation there's all these points a consistent strangulation that it takes forever to get these pictures there's the video cameras didn't work and this is the second time he tried to kill himself and he's a high-profile witness in a really really really important case involving pedophiles at the highest levels of government yeah I wouldn't I would think that that's the kind of guy you whack your also according to the procedure you're not to put one there's a suicide there you're not supposed to remove the body and take it to the emergency room you're supposed to treat it as though it was a murder or like a crime scene what's crazy is it's so high-profile like even is in because this is most likely how they did it forever right like people that whack people they were probably like you know I was doing comedy before the internet there they were probably whacking people before the internet right do you want to see I found the traffic image oh okay oh yeah let's go see it feelings here Brian but I saw that here's a weird texture on his cheek I thought interesting Brian liked I didn't like bed marks almost like he was I think that's just the blood rushing to his head bro that guy got strangled that looks like a strangled guy yeah that's what I thought or choked from it the thing is like there's no blood on that um I don't think there's no blood on that news that they said was the news that did it and there's no blood on his body and there's no pictures of him in the cell it didn't take any pictures of hold on there's no blood on the news they said killed him but yet there's blood on his net correct that was pointed out but that's insane that's insane that that's impossible if there did they really do a test of the rope that they supposedly said too sure of it and it looks very cool picture unused and Wow it is orange maybe the red doesn't show up that clean on orange can we look at it again I think we should probably look I want to say for sure that killed him in the lawyer she's talking to find the pieces his former cellmates lawyer hmm and he's just no it's obviously bro the former cellmate is my favorite part of the story gigantic ex-cop was a murderer and a drug dealer and he's fucking huge he's a gorilla a straight-up gorilla big Italian gorilla and they put him in jail with that guy come on and they probably uh oh come on look at his neck okay so they're examining the thing they this is dr. Michael baton from a trio and he's examining the thing that was supposedly used to kill him and he's saying there's nothing on it and he's showing the actual lacerations around the neck that show clear blood and he said it's too low in the net that's her population right here she says if he was if he did what you thought like which would have been like leaning forward on the ground that a probably have been a little higher under the jaw not down at the base of the neck kind of but that's a little bit tough to say yes sir I would imagine if you're killing somebody like that they're trying to get away people are trying to get away do that right if you're killing them from behind if that guy's holding them down oh come on man look at his neck hmm hold on though does any of that break actually breaking the skin the thing is it looks like a wire looks like a wire me it does look like a wire that's right it looks way too thin to be that yeah that yeah the thick cloth noose I mean maybe maybe that thick noose thing is really strong fabric but that looks like a wire I'm a man but wouldn't a wire just slice right into your neck - yeah it looks like that's more of like blood rising to the skin and then an actual cut yeah that's what I'm thinking - it looked before though like it was a cut so maybe there wasn't really that much blood that actually came through the skin and maybe are all that that cloth just maybe it's really thin and it gets down like a wire like if you choke somebody with like a bandana you know like if you you had like one of them bandanas that hippies put on their dogs and you choke someone to death with one of those things I gotta think it's gonna make a very small mark I don't think is gonna make a thick mark if you like got somebody like an exec you'll choke it's one of those things and fucking around yeah that's a strong it would it would get thin like where it was choking you like the actual yeah yeah would that make a mark like that at that I'm sure someone now is gonna go start myth-busting like how what it looks like if you do do that test and like they have to murder someone to find out if it's true just get another piece of shit so we'll find out later today I'm sure the whole thing is so strange man it's so public the idea that a guy actually had a fuck Island that's where he's your vase was joking about last night of course he was no but I did see the one clip that somebody put on the internet about him saying don't virtu signal just come on here and get a little prize go fuck off because nobody cares about your opinion I was like thank you Thank You Ricky thank you thank God that guy swings he's out there swinging from the hip chin up doesn't give a fuck telling it like it is I love it he went after I love this kind of Tim Cook's shit he went after Apple then he said if Isis opened up a studio you all be sending your resumes that what he said something more yeah you'd all be like yes streaming service she'll be contacting your agents or someone yeah that's what I said like fuck man good for him so they're all pre-written right because they had to have this cuts ready to go I don't know man he's so badass he might be able to do whatever the fuck he wants you know he's Ricky Gervais he's got he's got it the ability to probably say oh I'll do it I'll do it this way and only this way and they're like okay Ricky we love you we love you I we know you wouldn't do anything to jeopardize our amazing organization and we all love working weekend here at the Golden Gloves and it's fun I mean you stir people up and everybody knows you're a good guy he goes hit somewhat genocide talk okay Apple must have been so fast we're just getting away with using all that slave labor and nobody even noticed that's I mean it's another thing like this murder right it's like that's just how everything was done that's just how everything was done least that's how they whacked everybody and that was how you got things built cheap slave labor but nobody knew nobody really understood until you saw things like Foxconn you like wait wait this is a good setup you guys are working 16 hours a day you sleep in the building this is a good place this is good the stories I hear Amazon workers like running around and peeing themselves they oh yeah yeah they have some crazy countdown thing that goes when they get an order and they have to run to go get it probably a fun job if you're into losing weight put on some ankle weights some shit maybe a weight vest and just run around that thing you'd get a fucking vicious workout that's making lemonade out of lemons right everything's a workout you work it as a waiter at Applebee's and that's all that's right think about it man just with heavy weights around your waist then no one would notice you could have a good workout while you're working the Apple thing that that had to sting well he was standing right sitting right there too and they show him right before he starts saying it but he didn't throw any ham and say something about using sweats sweatshops and stuff like that right in front of them but I mean Foxconn is it's a sweatshop but it's done like it's probably like the best version of a sweatshop you know like you know it's uh it's a real company and it's its best version of a sweatshop Silurian a Foxconn works in the United States now right do they yeah I think they actually have or they're about to have companies here in the United States I remember there was this is something that Trump had talked about right yeah on top of the annual surveys ended his monologue by telling the nominees so if you do win here in a war tonight don't use it as a political platform to make a political speech you're in no position to lecture the public about anything you know nothing about the real world most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thornburg so if you win come up accept your little award thank your agent and your God and fuck off okay [Laughter] the swear was beeped out by NBC he also was was also beat for his use of profanity and two other jokes one where he called cats James Corden of fat pussy and another where he discussed the same films Judi Dench licking her ass Wow the comedian however also peppered the monologue with references to me too in contemporary issues we started off by noting that was his fifth time and therefore he didn't care what flack he would take then he punched in with a nod to last year's college admissions scandal I came here in a limo tonight and the license plate was made by Felicity Huffman good for him he's a real comic doesn't have the Apple quote he's a real comic that's that's a look there right down it's a down although it said a little lower than that it said Apple yeah while discussing the edition of Apple TV plus to the room Gervase noted the irony of a meet to theme show like the morning show being made by a company runs flesh shops in China you say your walk but if Isis started streaming service you'd call your agent [Music] we're gonna get this right folks I really believe this good friend this is what we're talking about earlier about everything being bad I don't think it is I think it I think it's just a lot of noise there's a lot of noise a lot of people yelling it's swinging back around already it's swinging back around we're human yeah you know we have weird things where everything's change it's all changed now everything's changed okay relax we're okay we're gonna be all right the world's fucked we're fucked it's all it's all ending I'm a little nervous about Iran though that seems like real shit that that makes me want to get educated on the subject so I could really freak out the one thing that made me feel better is when they were screaming death to America death to America recently the president of Iran was like well when we say death to America we don't mean the citizens we like the citizens we're talking about fuck you Donald Trump you know saying that for a long time that death to America chant that's been around right that's a tough sell yeah we know what you're saying you're saying death to America okay like that's one thing that you don't want to be misconstrued if you want to fucking make signs and yell like you don't like you okay hey we're not talking deaf deaf guys right oh yeah definitely not death death let's go out and scream death to America everyone's gonna know I don't be the worst way to communicate something Wow if you don't really think that why would you say death to the American political system death to the American middle complex not death to America right that's America everybody how they got us all mixed we don't have nothing to do with this guys we're just over you're chillin how they got us messed up in some international conflict that you actually have to think about might come a knocking on your door how what what fucking ineptitude mixed with scumbag eree led us to this position who did who did this is that they are Iranian guys the Trump do something he shouldn't have done it seemed weird timing though with this whole impeachment shit it's all weird dude it's all weird the fact that Trump can kill people just understand how crazy is that you got a guy like Trump who could just go send it in send the missile just shoot missiles he could just listen man don't give me that power either don't give anybody that power for sure but a guy like Trump guy was a famous for being mean to people on a reality show you fired famous for being a baller I mean that's what he's famous for he was in that's the crazy thing like he was in rap songs all the time in like a complementary way like that guy's life has gone through an arch home alone - he was at home alone - and in Canada those silly fucks they edited it out the CBC edited out the Donald Trump scene because it's offensive offensive us.just who who really enjoy films without monsters that's history you're gonna go into fucking Naked Gun and get rid of OJ we gonna do what are you gonna do you gonna take OJ out of the NFL archives what do you do now this is life lately you can't make life prettier by pulling Donald Trump out of home alone you're supposed to look it and go holy shit who would have thought that fucking guy would be the president one day I'd be killing dudes and maybe starting World War 3 like a goddamn Stephen King novel you know Stephen King's freaked out by Trump hmm these media posts oh whatever these media posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any US person or target the United States will click quickly and fully strike back and perhaps in a disproportionate manner such legal notice is not required but is given nevertheless do it fuck this that I don't like to see on Twitter that seems so bizarre that almost seems like the the simulation theory has hired like comedy writers to come and subtly fuck with everybody that you can just put that on Twitter how can they just put that on Twitter like I thought there was a series of checks and balances you know I mean if this is ultimately like one guy can have like an instantaneous press conference anytime you want just by putting something on Twitter and then there's all these people that go you got a bantam for Twitter but here's the problem you ban them from Twitter gab is gonna he'll go to gab right if he goes to gab gab all sudden skyrocket cuz ever he's gonna want to go to gab to see Trump talk shit on gab whether it's full freedom of speech what if he starts swearing on gap what they make a deal with them well if they give him 50% of gap because they think it's imminent because of this war we're in with Iran this could be a movie where they're gonna ban him from Twitter and Vidya and Jack Dorsey has to leave he's in a meditation silent meditation in fucking Bali and he has to fly in and he has to figure out whether or not they can make this executive decision to ban Trump but everybody's calling for it ban Trump and Trump banna banna and then they if they banned him off Twitter imagine if you went to the thing and the Page said banned you would just open up your windows and hear liberals cheering like King Kong just fell off the Empire State Building yeah hey fuck it banned the YouTube videos would be spectacular do you know how many virtue signaling dipshits would have YouTube videos just screaming and pumping their fists in the air and pointing to the screen Donald Trump says owned you know how many it would be it would be hilarious and all he would have to do is do that and go over somewhere else and that new platform would be fucking gigantic because everybody would want to know what he says and if he says it over there everybody else would just retweeted on Twitter anyway it would probably be like killing coyotes you know how you kill coyotes and then they make more coyotes like a female when they when they when they shout out that's like a roll call and if someone's missing the female makes more babies that's one of the craziest things about coyotes that's why they're everywhere that's what would happen with Trump if they ban him off Twitter his signal would be bigger than ever it would be fucking bonkers like they're in a precarious situation now too because these these social media companies they're they're being labeled as someone who would ban freedom of speech from certain people if they don't believe with their ideas now this happens to be the president that they say you can't have freedom of speech on our platform anymore then everything is like out the window like what is this what are we doing and then if it backfires and Twitter loses all of its power and some other fucking company comes along and takes the spot some company that promises to never do that to the president let people express themselves but explain perhaps through a fucking series of checks and balances while you can't stalk somebody or be mean to somebody or just make any sensor which is it about him being on the most popular is like Twitter doesn't like the most popular platform because he could do radio he could do anything they want and nobody's it no one's paying attention to the radio or the TV things that he does and everyone pays attention to his tweets well it's interesting because he's gotta think he has I mean he's a guy that obviously he does a lot of business deals and he does a lot of deals simultaneously it's the only way he can have as many properties as he has you know he's got Trump Towers everywhere he's got him in Vegas and Chicago and all over the world like he's got to be a guy that's always thinking about doing the next thing and if he was like you would think he's like he's setting himself up as a business it's like he's a business he's now not just a president and he's always been a business he's always been a celebrity in a you know iconic financial character but now his entertainment like what he says about life and everything is fucking super valuable if Trump like Trump had that show if he decides to have a podcast you know goddamn crazy it would be if Donald Trump just pulls up has a YouTube channel talks into the camera says what he really thinks about everything they've released it as a podcast as well and no one can stop him because that's freedom of speech his freedom of speech is let this guy talk if he start threatening people like threatening Iran from his YouTube channel like what the fuck imagine if World War III is caused by a tweet magic Trump threatens someone and they retaliate to show they're not scared we nuke them and then oh my god from a trump tweet is that possible seems like anything is possible he's probably gonna do it right at the end too but the end is a weird one right like is it gonna be a few months from now or is it gonna be four years from now that's with all this Iran things it might happen faster it I didn't think it was going to happen at all but now maybe this my ranch midday yeah maybe this is off for a purpose it's not gonna just go that's the thing and there's a lot of people that don't want him to go the Republicans don't want to lose power and they're very smart in that even ones that are you know that we're never Trump errs at one point in time they've accepted him he's a fascinating guy he's a fascinating like human character if you look at them in terms of like just his go back to that photo that were just looking at let me see that big-time he's a fascinating character man and he's also a very strong guy in a lot of ways like mentally strong in terms of ways he's been able to accomplish all the business deals always believes in himself there's something about that that gets other people and they sort of like they get a little ass kissy around him and they just they want him to like them because if he doesn't like you it's devastating if Trump goes 1/2 to you on Twitter he gets mad at you devastating so they all want him to like them so look at them all reaching for him like that's like a that's a painting one day that they'll have on the caves they'll cave paint that after World War 3 after we get Newt into the fucking Stone Age they'll they'll cave paint how guy figured out how to be just mean enough but just nice enough and have all these people like them and literally be able to kill someone with the press of a button and then everybody wants to touch him like look at that they're reaching for him they're reaching look at the guy in the back they're all reaching second Michelangelo paint well it is and that this guy somehow got into this crazy position from hosting a reality show and getting really famous by telling people they're fired and now all sudden he's he's deciding whether or not they can nuke generals into another dimension from a robot that flies and just shoots missiles and the missiles are called Hellfire missiles did you hear that new I think Russia has it that super psychos 2027 don't Jesus Christ will drop it from space and it's just like roller coasters itself in and like we don't I guess we don't have a thing to stop it yet it's 27 times the speed of sound oh Jesus Christ this is the space war shit yeah this is why Trump wanted to have a space for us when I heard about a space for us I was like what do you what are you doing man space for us but here's the other thing when you're 74 whatever he is do you realize you're 74 are you just alive I think you're just alive especially if you're on diet pills then I think you're really just alive you're out there you're just fucking grinding you just like grinding because that's how you do it you just go out there and you kick ass he's not thinking about riding off into the sunset he's not thinking about any of that shit but people we think that way when we see someone 274 but look oh by the time he's 78 he's gonna want out you second to one out he's not gonna one out he's alive is he alive yeah he's gonna he's gonna keep going especially if you're stimulated if you're artificially stimulated you know I mean I'm talking right now while I'm drinking coffee that's why I'm so excited is he tick tocking yet I hope he does I hope it that'd be great I take talk to my first tick-tock was three almost three million in 24 hours Jaime says they fuck with the numbers yeah they said you have to write my comments were like in the thousands though but maybe those are all robots spam robots well they're obviously working overtime to try to get it big and a lot of people were jumping on board Kevin Hart just got on board that is a big that's a big acquisition I can't do it in the rock the rock out on board that's another big acquisition I took all my social media and I put it in the folder it says addict I put it on my last page my iPhone and I got a smaller iPhone oh you did once you get that yeah that one's better regular one yeah there's an article in New York Times this weekend that tik-tok groups are taking over the youtubers of Hollywood and like moving into mansions and like imagine whatever they're imagine how they making all this money I don't understand it but imagine a tick-tock president is our first tick-tock president maybe give you dude what no yeah could be what if it was thought we could make that happen what what if it was the whole staff of shark tank that would be a good idea like they would be the president yeah but they all work together it's not a bad idea right I think a bunch of successful reasonable people and I'll mean successful financially even just you know like scholars may be businesspeople and scholars mixed together like that would be the right way to run the country like a committee where you could see the way they interact with each other in real time so everybody would have access to all the communication unless it's anything to do with like national security you know I mean obviously they can't let everybody know that they're gonna bomb that guy and Iran you know they can't do that but it'd be really interesting if like policy issues economic issues if all those things were discussed publicly like if you saw these guys like if you saw the guy who is you know one of the ten people who is the president right and you saw them all present evidence and they all go over the work and they look at it this is what its projected if we don't cut carbon emissions this is what we know and this is the hyperbole this is the clickbait thing here this is the reality of it and this is where we're at now and here here's our possible solutions and we'd all just sit around and they'd look at the budget even say okay we're gonna put X amount of billion to this and Y amount of billion to that and then we're gonna put you know of a significant amount in it and we can go away why do you why are they doing it that way like like everything else right the the the internet has allowed people to communicate and pitch and piss and moan about everything else but not really on the inner workings of government they're still doing in like these rooms they're still doing it tucked away you can watch some of it on CNN but some of you don't get to see talked to a national security national interests secrecy so I mean you give people the option to have stuff like that like gigantic world wide decisions that are made by a handful of people that is kind of crazy it's kind of crazy that someone whether it's Trump or anybody could make that decision like this might throw us into nuclear war we want to let these motherfuckers know what's up let's take a rocket and kill that fucking guy you want to do it let's do it let's fucking kill that guy the fact that you can do that the fact you how many people do you think were involved in the decision to kill that Iranian guy I read that it was there's some sort of like PowerPoint presentation given to trump and it was the last slide was like this is our option another option is doing this and then they like unexpectedly he picked that yeah there was like he picked the craziest one like the killing they don't know Wow see that's what's crazy so that's one person that's even more crazy like one person gets to make that call like we always thought there was like so many checks and balances like don't this is what I kept hearing from reasonable people like Bryan Callen he won't be able to get anything done once it gets in there it's just like there's so many systems and checks and balances he this is the reason why the founding fathers were so smart and the way they set up the Constitution and set up our government Wow if he can fucking start World War three if he can do that and that starts World War three yeah they missed that part yeah you fucked up you missed the Twitter part - its Twitter part they're gonna have to change that right after him right oh and we're adding no Twitter no do it mild ticked off this crazy this is I feel like this is yes yeah crazy video he put on his YouTube channel yeah well this is he keeps doing that character people I'm dying bro Yeah right but how did the guy die suicides was decided do you see the list after he sees like died what they were involved with Kevin Spacey yeah oh my god like a lot yeah there's like three or four accusers I think I can imagine if it's the actor from game from house of cards the actor that was his assistant that killed people for him imagine that yes imagine Doug the guy is so deep into his character that he goes out and whacks all because it was the best role he had a god I see that you think Kevin Spacey should get pissed if we play this you did but just like Max was gonna show up in his next one I feel like right just look they're hanging out somewhere but it's so strange that he's doing it like this you know I'm saying that me this is a character look he's wrestling the fire I know what you're thinking it's not that hard trust me the next time someone does something you don't like you can go on the attack but you can also hold your fire and do the unexpected you can kill them with kindness what the fuck he says this and then the guy commits suicide bro what is this world imagine if he threatens everybody and starts getting jobs again people like I don't know how he's doing it but everybody's dying well it's just hiring man let's house of cards would be fucking huge just hear me out season nine we never show that he was dead we never showed he was dead they that the last season when they had know him I was like what are you doing okay what the fuck are you doing what are you doing here what would you do to my show this ain't my show this is like oh my god everybody's watching us that's what the show was now oh my god everybody's watching everything we do oh my god now what do we do that show seems so like nervous didn't it the first episode it was like they didn't have like a regular house of cards episode it was like everything was like a little bit barely glued together like huh I try to figure out how to say how he was gone or whatever - right and it's like I wonder if like they were reluctant I'm wonderful life is cheap on the show they don't leave people watch hell apology is a refill might they did that other movie they didn't even start yet right do you remember there was a movie they made where they had to go back and shoot with somebody else that he was that's right yeah that's right done do they never reshoot it he was great in baby driver he's a great actor man he's just a crazy fuck that grabs dicks the one guy that died though one of the reasons why I mean I'm not really that I don't I don't think that this would warrant a murder all they did was they were hanging out and he said Kevin Spacey reached down and grabbed his junk and said let's go get some air and he got mad and said no what the fuck but do you think somewhat mean would that be a reason why Kevin Spacey would kill you for saying that I mean how many people is he gonna kill do you think he killed people what do you think I wanna know your honest opinion what if he always killed people Kevin Spacey settles assault lawsuit following death of accuser it was one week after that video was posted whoa you settled it how many now I think Sam Tripoli or somebody posted like a list of all the people there was like four or five people Tripoli might yeah one was loves it Tripoli seen his glory in but look this is a real all this shit that's happening is a real it's a good time to be conspiracy theorists yeah because there's a few of them that aren't ridiculous there's some juicy ones right now like fuck this Jack Ruby shit let that one go we don't know folks we're never gonna know but I'll tell you what we got one in front of us right now that rivals that we got quite a few of them and how about that the first British astronaut the furthest she's a woman first woman in space I think from from Britain - I think I might be wrong about that but she was talking about aliens that aliens definitely exist they're definitely out there astronauts aliens definitely exist and they could be living amongst among us on earth says Britain's first astronaut powerful Britain first astronauts to check all those dudes over there just must have been too polite let her get the gig Wow yeah good for her that's a badass move to be the first astronaut it was a woman from a country like that bitch run shit right you got to be powerful because then think about how many British dudes are in like space force whatever the fuck they have over there what do they have they have the SS people like what no it's not SS that's nuts the Nazis what do they have they have mi6 but they have a s something what do they have like what's their version of like the CIA when I'm thinking James Bond but I think there's a 35 they have something Secret Service into sis is that's what it is si yes that's what it is I'm saying SS I'm like no they're not Nazis don't fuck you're ruining it again same thing is that my steak that's what it's is it same thing yeah yeah like think about all those people that they must have had in their Air Force all the men and then a woman gets to be the first person in space that's pretty badass or somebody wanted a woman to be the first person in space and they made sure that's possible I don't know though but if it's the former I like to think positive I like to think she kicked everybody's ass became the first woman in space that's gotta be a trippy trippy fucking thing first person from a nation to be launched into the gases above our head and to see the blackness the blackness of no atmosphere she was just the first British woman right mm-hmm yeah I see the first British person yeah that's what it said right I was always more of that Challenger chick oh no the teacher man yeah I remember that I remember watching that at a girlfriend's house good hair I went to visit her she lived in western Massachusetts how to drive all the way out there I was like she was a couple hours and in the morning I watched on television after the fact elected I wasn't awake when it actually happened I watched I watched it after I woke up I remember seeing that thing blow up yeah we watched it with our whole fifth-grade class our whole school when I was in fifth grade is that her Sally Ride that's the woman but that's not the schoolteacher that's not the girl from challenger right she died she's an astronaut the girl who was a schoolteacher there was a woman who they brought on board who's just a schoolteacher and that was like the big it's a weird thing right it's like it's okay if certain people die but like a schoolteacher dying made it way worse yeah she had more of a perm I think how do you say that Christa McAuliffe yeah yeah and that lady died everybody was like oh man but if it was like all astronauts just like all dudes who wear aviators mirrored sunglasses or hard to ask fucking chiseled faces we'd feel bad we wouldn't feel as bad you know I mean yeah I felt bad that was hard I was like nine our first 911 I think it was the amount of death but it turns out the shock they had on our system yeah because I think I think we all thought that we were going to space and like that this was like space 1999 I was gonna turn out to be right mm-hmm because that was what is that I graduated in Newton south class of 85 so that was the year after that there was 86 bro yeah that's we thought we were all gonna be in space we thought that they retired the Apollo program and they just started doing the shuttles and really just ramping up the infrastructure of space and eventually we're gonna be living on the moon no I remember when they said they were like retiring the challenger's and all the shuttles like a couple years ago like what no no I wouldn't that was sad yeah and then Elon Musk has got some crazy fucking spaceship he's trying to shoot people in the atmosphere with he's gonna be in charge of space force but it's interesting you know he was people forget he was a part of something in the Trump administration when it first happened when Trump first got in office and he left when Trump backed out of the Paris Accord the climate Accord that was a case right yeah there's like a group of business people that I think they all left together mm-hmm yeah one guy is a lot of power man updated news on another story Harvey Weinstein indicted on new sex crimes in Los Angeles you just want a trial today in New York on his other charges these new charges just dropped in an hour ago Jesus what kind of sex crimes sexual assault charges one woman sexually assaulting another in separate incidents over two day period in 2013 who allegedly raped a woman okay so he still has charges against him I thought for some reason all his charges have been okay he's on trial in New York and this is a separate thing here and know what they should do with him they should get him they said listen we're willing to be more lenient on you but we want to get you in a room just clad in a jumpsuit and we're gonna give you a high dose of MDMA and we're just gonna talk to you Harvey about how you feel about people and why you lash out and how did this all get started what's true and what's not true what did you do to people and what what what did people willingly do and is that is that the same thing that's where it gets weird it's like sex as a transaction is one of the it's it's one of the weirder things about people is that you can do that like it's almost like everyone's a drug dealer right like if someone wants to fuck you the drug is sex like that feeling of sex like that people love it they love it everybody loves it so if someone knew that other people love it and then get something to let those other people do it and we go no you can't you can't why can't you but you're doing it anyway just by virtue of your looks right if you're just if you're just trying to be successful on being good-looking in a lot of ways you're it's like the entry level of that game like you're doing you're looking good so that people give you things you're looking good so that people pay you if you want to be like a professional hot chick or a model or you know you're you're looking good and then people pay you because you're looking good and we're all like we have no problem with that everyone feels no problem with that but if you go and do that and then use your body say I like looking good because I can get things but if I use my body I get more things so I've been using my body well you can't you can't what is that we can't imagine if gold diggers it was encouraged and guys liked it too and they're like a bunch of old dudes I didn't care and then it was all free on the internet like that everybody would give out information you just I'll take care of your right come over here and Chuck Johnson if we just made deals like transactional deals keep it clean that's pretty much what girls do but no but you can't do it legally this is my point is like we came like webcam stuff there's so many lazy girls out there that don't want how to take a job if they can get 2,000 bucks but blowing some old dude they be in on that nothing wrong with that though that's my position nothing wrong with that do you think we'll see that legal soon like that that should be snap so nobody wants their daughter to be a whore the fuck you talk but it's one of those things it's a hypocritical even of course it should be legal everything should be legal of course you don't want your daughter to be a hooker but of course everything should be legal that doesn't see if it's illegal people are still gonna want it so if they're gonna want it then you're gonna get it where it's illegal and you're gonna get criminals people that can go to jail they're gonna be the ones that are providing these girls with protection they're gonna be the ones that also dictate how much money the girls make and how much money they take and we all know what happens there I mean that's pimp 101 they what the we all seen pimps up hoes down right right right and the others are American pimp was that the other one that was great one two this is if it was legal these girls would be protected they'd probably have the exact same amount of people that were paying for it actually more would paid for it for sure if it became legal what am I talking about at that spot next to the comic store used to be a brothel but katana yeah katana was a brothel to watch that the Sunset Strip documentary back in the 30s probably it was a while Twyla commute AFOL it's a beautiful place smells good the imagine was like back then people just like Bugsy Siegel they own the The Comedy Store you know right yeah that was Bugsy Siegel's place he imagined people just got whacked back then shut the fuck up no everyone had a shovel in their trunk the old photos of the stars and stuff that would go to that or insane insane yeah that in that weird peep thing where you can look down from the green room and see onto the stage yeah so strange the fact that Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis were looking through their fucking mop man the government is kind of a mob I mean it's an elected mob well it's kind of a mob you know especially me see people are Julian Assange were you like wait what are you doing him why are you doing that to him what did he do exactly what happened there he apparently got hacked like a lot of people said that like he put out unredacted names apparently what I heard that or what I read was that that wasn't the case that he put out the stuff with redacted names but someone got to hold the original copy of it and they released it Mexican president calls for Julian Assange is freedom oh shit it's going down Champa wants to talk some shit julian assange in Mexico with Pamela Anderson on the beach doing YouTube I called it I called it now a moron dude together holding hands talking about the future Greta Thornburg adopts them what let him out bring him to fucking Punta Mita bro do you ever try harder do you ever travel to Mexico I love Mexico what's your favorite part porta viar-toe yeah yeah I love it there you know what else is dope is teaching Itza see that's the Mayan ruins in the Yucatan Hawk man that that was one where I was walking around it going what who how like what were you guys like you guys built giant huge stone structures that mimic the cosmos you had specific rooms that were designed for LSD use that would take some the guy at least according to my guide he was saying that they had some plant that had life surgeon in it there's a bunch of different plants like what do they get him from Morning Glory seeds Morning Glory seeds apparently get acid from and they would take whatever this they don't know exactly what the substance was they were trip balls but he showed me all these different places where they did like sack of human sacrifice where they had this game and then the game what was really crazy is who's that's the human sacrifice spot they would put people right on that spot and cut their fucking heart out Hollow and look at the dude let dudes face that you would kill someone on like it's so creepy they're pulling you over there and laying you down on that fucking thing to cut your heart out fuck now that was a weird thing that people used to like to do human sacrifice you know like do you know about the Mexican pyramid the Aztec pyramid of I think you say tale to con do you know how to say that tio tio tio tio con so you can get an audio so we can listen to how how you pronouncing that word but that temple when they built it afterwards they slaughtered all of the slaves how do you say that here we go talk to a professor how to pronounce here we go tio tio ah come - language what is dog language tio tio con tu people just like when they believed in magic they had cooler ways of describing things Tod will con this I mean how are you like little stop and look at that word how are you living 10,000 years ago barely scraping by you have the time to come up with that many words like that many that many sounds for one word tio 2 a con you know what's your name Jamie Vernon super simple comes off the tongue zero problems same amount of sounds where do you live uh Ohio Quixote wakhan that's like why is it so big why is that the amount of letters - yeah eleven letters is what as my name yeah all together say - syllable but I need a space alright I need it whenever they get words inches long right that's like run-on sentences hey I need you to pause it's probably three words it should be make it three words I don't remember it it probably was does that seem simple make it three words and I'll remember it make it one big ass stupid word with a bunch of weird silent letters I don't know what the fuck you're doing here Tod wakhan okay you know there's a bunch of them words you know Johnny and J tech who Tony Hinchcliffe favorite fighter former UFC strawweight champion beast of a woman her name try pronouncing that shit there's a J and then a Z and it starts when you say it starts with you yeah yeah you say like her last name it sounds like there's an end there's no end in there wait yeah how do you spell it I could not spell it if you put a gun to my head J our z ej c z YK what is that in a lot and you the way you said is young JIT chick I hope I'm not fucking that up I'm doing like I guess that's J chick I don't know the actual letter that second a that's you wanna you injection let's change J oh and II with a dick that's a transient hangar with a hanger how come they don't have the hangar in the large font probably to somebody fucked up formatting editor slipped up over a Wikipedia Wow so what do you think that transy means is it a J it doesn't seem anything like Youngjae chick that's weird when other countries use the same letters as we do but they don't agree on the sound that's like oh we're just in crazy town now yeah it's a nasal e mmm he was a little tail yeah none your honor young JIT chick an e with a little tail huh nasal e too complicated you fucks it's like that chick from my cousin video what's her name yo man yeah so that there was one other thing that we wanted to talk about when we first started one of them was Jeffrey Epstein do you remember what the other one was you were gonna show me the Jeffery up since I got such a child anything and then George Lopez it's common oh that's it that's it so and then there's a there's a bounty on Trump's head gasps I don't know how anyone heard it or where that listed it but I read it on Twitter and then people who sit how much is the bounty 80 million from somewhere in Iran or I don't know have you got a bet DSi you can see the magic thing nuke Trump where does the world stand if they only drop one nuke and it's on the White House small one little baby nuke just levels the entire building and everything near well Iran jump were dropped out of there the nuclear accord gonna start enriching uranium again Trump though tweeted Iran does not have any nuclear weapons exclamation point hashtag something right but they can get them yeah this is so crazy this seems like for the first time in a long time I'm thinking we could go to war with a country it just seems crazy the internet jumped in a world war three memes immediately instantly twenty four hours of straight jokes what do you think happens I don't know I don't even know what's happening right now I could because stuff could be happening right now it's what did the guy do cuz Dan Crenshaw was saying that he organized the attack on the embassy and then he was organizing other attacks on us sites he was a bad guy suppose he like there was there is some stuff saying like he is a bad guy it's just how Trump did it is how the problem he did help fight Isis a lot also so he he wasn't he was a really bad guy but there was points like he the biggest problem is that Trump just went out and pretty much assassinated them you know like instead of dealing with it like an adult did he imagine when they went through all those other like really finely detailed points this is a strategy we can employ or we just take him out with a missile did he already was trolling Trump to like trolling them on Twitter I don't know if that was sure oh my job did you imagine if that guy was trolling Trump and Trump killed him oh I'm just talking about his hands or something Oh Mike imagine imagine you talking about orange skin it's fake hair his fucking baby hands it's like oh yeah fucking baby hands oh my god he got into a meme battle with Trump oh my Google too quick it could be a fake site I don't think it is a daily daughter is not a fake site maybe maybe it was too quick I don't know their daily dot is that a real website no I'm trying to confirm okay things look real keep us posted okay I don't want to comment just yet cuz I have a feeling I have a lot to say about this it's so crazy man it's so crazy that this fucking this situation that we find ourselves in where none of us who are listening to this had anything to do with any of this shit that might kill a million people none of us none of us and then our leaders like that we we've been so roped in this fucking game of Thrones mentality that our leaders are gonna make these critical decisions for us and they're gonna be in charge of whether what kind of diplomacy we employ on other nature's gonna represent us in the most personal way possible like the way he does it like the way Trump does it that's personal that's how he is so he's standing for us but he's standing up for himself as a person there's part of that too right like he doesn't want to be fucked with he wants you to know the United States not gonna be fucked with me in charge like Jarrah so it's like him he's the one out there and he's the one they go you can you could just knew the guys like well fuck all just Nukem commander of the Islamic Revolution guards corpse force major general honey Singh's name crossing Seoul Imani cutscene cos he lost the first miscellaneous Solem a knee respond as a u.s. president Donald Trump's announcement of sanctions are coming with a game of Thrones inspired meme of his own it says I will stand against you and it has the game of thrones like oh and you so he put that up and then Trump yeah this is a couple months ago but this is November at 2018 a year ago he's got that speed memory something trumped remember shit just motherfucker owes me since the 70s that's crazy that is crazy a guy memes you and then you murder him whoa Jesus Christ Baked Alaska better hide it was a game of Thrones thing crazy it's so crazy that these worlds have collided then what do you think Putin is probably laughing his ass off right now he's probably got his feet up on the chair smoking a cigar just laughing and laughing and watching this chaos play out and then for sure he's gonna help Iran for sure the anything it destabilizes his number one competitor that's what China's gonna do to this is so dumb it's also scary but it's also one of those things where we don't know what the fuck is going on so it could have been the right move we don't know I mean it might it might have been the thing you have to do to avoid more more deaths China Russia and Iran hold joint naval drills in the Gulf of Oman Oh terrific that's great China Russia and Iran together we're getting to some World War 3 shit here that's World War 3 that is like when Italy was joined in Germany I mean that's what that is we should probably get away from the coast bro imagine imagine if this fucking guy gets us into World War 3 by deciding to do that and then have all these crazy threats see the rest of the world does not want to think there's one of things like if you think you're the baddest motherfucker and you represent the baddest country you got to kind of almost be like a real baddest motherfucker like a guy like steep a Miocic like a UFC heavyweight champ they don't go around saying they're gonna kick everybody's ass because everybody already knows it and if you you start saying that you're gonna be able to do whatever you want and maybe even do in a disproportionate manner all the other countries like why do you have any power ik who are you man and they said like we're really powerful we all get together bitch you're pretending you're more powerful than everybody that's a weird thing to do it's a weird chest puffing strategy to take on a country that has allies that's where it gets fucked up it's not just Iran Iran it's all Iran's allies they all get together now you have a giant force of people and nuclear weapons congratulations did you guys play chess or did you play checkers growing up how the fuck are you just a tic-tac-toe ace and you didn't see this coming this is why it's really important to have you know people have to be able to talk did Bill have dialogue you see this tweet that he said yes targeted 52 Iranian sites representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago bro that was during the Carter Administration I think we can let that go it's not the same fucking people those people are all dead this that's crazy so this is more team mentality yeah but that'll get the yokels all the fuckin yeah all the dudes just jump off the tractor jacking off into the fields and they hear that yeah fucking janab chomp whoo this shit could get hot you could get hot and it could get real and if he really has the ability to do that what other calls does he have the ability to do is there ever gonna be another moment like that where Iran boxes in a ship and then he sends in a fighter jet I mean is this gonna really fuckin happen because then none of us can go anywhere we have to hide and we gotta get out of LA cuz it definitely nuke that like this is because imagine the movie if it all played out like that in like a Stephen King movie made a thing about a game show host that eventually becomes the president United States and starts a war while he's on speed I do that every day I'm really hot well now I'm getting there I was not getting there before um this was enough to make me go holy shit like is there a better way to handle that then blasting that guy with a robot from the sky like where did we start I don't know man it's I don't want to know right you don't want to know that all over the world these little pieces are in motion they're trying to protect us from terrorists trying to make sure that they stop Isis and this sect is growing here and these people are getting shot there and what about the cartels now getting up listen you if you will be paralyzed by fear if you took in all the information on all the fucking danger all over the world you'd be paralyzed by fear that's that was when I was in Vegas while this was happening this we and if you didn't look at your phone you wouldn't have known yeah this was going on no I didn't hear anybody talking about it yeah I didn't lean all around that was the good thing about being off social media and this is was my point the first place by the time things get to me it's it's already been sort of distributed better you know I get it you know I'll have to jump on right away and it becomes the focus of my day long before we know anything and I keep refreshing CNN every five minutes I'm scared like legitimately this is looking for the first time in a long time I'm since like 9/11 where I'm legitimately like oh well this is this is some real shit this could be really bad because if he says he's gonna do something in a disproportionate manner he's threatening them he's calling their bluff brothers is so dangerous it's so dangerous because all they have to do is just nuke Hawaii do something like that where the rest the world be like hey hey hey what are we gonna do in killing each other everywhere everyone because that's what could happen there's like mutually assured destruction was always supposed to be the the big impediment that mutually assured destruction if we knew that if we shot them they've shoot us we'd all be dead that that's what kept us from using bombs but who the fuck knows man what if Iran just says listen if we just sneak a bomb in by the time it's detonated they won't even have a chance to respond the whole system would be fucked the grid will be down all their entertainment would be down everything would be down and then the rest of the world can figure out a way to unite together and take over the power that the United States once enjoyed they were abusing that power they were the number one superpower in the world and they let their guy take diet pills and threaten everybody on Twitter I don't know if he takes diet pills he had him in his dresser but I don't even know if those are his I just want to say maybe it's just strong coffee maybe some of these Jocko energy drinks what are they so choco just dropped him off Dakota Meyer sent him he's a part of the company I guess Jocko was an energy drink want some sure get really mad and and right now this is a good time for these right because we're talking about America chuckles probably won't America on man under flavor this ever lived that's right last both blackface and retard five coasters the last it'll never be a major movie again like tropical Thunder right never impossible no no impossible that's funny we were saying earlier that if they cut out Oh Jay can you imagine if they just cut out Oh Jay and put all the OJ pieces together and made one Oh Jay this is good this is good no artificial colors sweeteners or flavors sugar-free Kido so I've been on the carnivore diet tell you about that yeah that's like a healthier keto right or better way I don't know it's just all meat just everything's meat I'm not eating and any any grains and I'm not eating any carbs nothing else I mean I have like an olive good add a Bloody Mary this is fucking hob and olive so it's not the most strict occasionally I'll deviate I'm allowing myself to glasses of wine and most of the rest of shit I'm just drinking easy to water or he's killed cliffs the CBD killed cliffs shit carnivores like keto but you're allowed to have fruit or something meat you just eating meat like mostly meat and because I eat a lot of wild game I have to substitute it so I have to supplement it with fat I'm adding other fats to it cuz wildgame it does not have much fat and you can when I read about the people that did this in the reserve there was a guy that was with the Inuit he was an explorer in the Arctic and he was talking about how he lived like that for six months and then it was one of the videos somewhere online but his old black-and-white footage and that the key was getting a lot of fat they were just drinking water and eating meat and they were fine as long as they got a lot of fat they would hit the like whale blubber and polar bear blubber and they would eat all this blubber to sort of supplement their uh therefore their fat intake they say he was very healthy eating like that I'm just doing it as an experiment that you found the guy oh look at that probably I would imagine this is probably a truth about the Inuit diet maybe not they didn't need any vegetables man oh it's a long one too but yeah those people didn't need any vegetables I'm just curious I'm just giving it a shot there's they call it world carnivore montt so I said okay let me see what Jordan Peterson is the main reason I want to try it because I really respect his thought process and I really respect his mind and when he started talking about all the different medical benefits that he had from trying it then he had autoimmune diseases that went away and I'm like hmm what is this and I know a bunch of people personally they've tried it - is this a gentleman think so yeah yep that's him yes yeah so he lived up with the Antarctic what's interesting is he said that they didn't eat the organ meat they gave the organ meat to the dogs I thought that was really weird because that's definitely been proven to be the mutts the guy right there give me some volume on this dude we do that or they get us in trouble very or I don't know if this is in the open domain anyway we just I just I'll just encapsulate what he said he just basically said that as long as they had yeah that's the guy as long as they had plenty of fat I'm just seeing what it feels like it's weird I'll tell you one thing I do not trust my butthole at all mm-hmm I feel fart coming on and like others could be a disaster I've had rocketing diarrhea from meat that's from all meat yeah this is what dr. Shaun Baker who's like one head carnivore proponents it's like his whole life revolves around eating steak and deadlifting it's kind of hilarious and getting people to eat meat and try this carnivore diet and some of them have had some pretty radical health benefits and I'm so curious about that because I know that sometimes people convince themselves that something is better for them and that something's working better and they feel better and then there's a sort of a placebo effect that can happen when you join a community of people that's also saying the same thing like we're all getting better we're all feeling better so I was real hesitant when I first went into it I was like oh god if I've I got I need to know there's there's something to this or this is a nonsense way to eat because most of my thought process was this kind of nonsense we do you should eat some fiber this clearly benefits eating some vegetables but what's interesting is the the level of energy or your energy level it's like right here stays it doesn't go anywhere it doesn't go anywhere I mean at the end of the day I'm kind of tired and then I go to sleep that's weird man because how much of your energy levels during the day is based on your body regulating sugar and insulin how much of it how much is your energy level is based on that it might be a lot this is because this is the the unquestionable difference of this diet unquestionable difference is that my energy level basically has a flat line there's no roller coaster anymore and I had less of a roller coaster because I'm pretty healthy and I'm pretty strict with what I eat but not like this this is like this sure so for the last nine days or so whatever the fuck it's been I've had like an olive I had um does your body constantly ptosis at all I must yeah I'm not checking it must it must be in ketosis I mean I'm eating a lot of fat I'm eating bacon with all these wild game dishes everything i makin with because i need fat and i'm cooking everything in beef tallow Wow and then I'm getting like fatty meat to butter or anything I'm using butter yeah you could drink milk I mean the idea is like if you were a carnivore you would take everything out of the body the milk the fat everything look man it's weird I see why people would be opposed to it morally and ethically because you don't it would require people to consume a lot more animals because every if everybody's eating meat all the time the consumption the need would go up and to be even more slaughter I got it it seems like a grant you're gonna get really bored quick very likely that's very likely that I get really quick but it's curious because if I think and I don't necessarily think this I'm just saying if I think this is the best way for me to eat I'm not saying that I'm trying it and I'm basically trying it based on mark Bell and Chris Bell and and even more Jordan because I've talked in depth with Jordan about it Jordan Peterson is a brilliant guy and when he was describing his experiences with this diet I was like what how many people have done this right how many modern super intelligent well-read articulate people like Jordan Peterson have done this diet I bet it's a really really small amount because socially it's unappealing to even say you're gonna do it's sort of a taboo you're gonna only eat meat oh you're gonna eat all the meat do not even eat any vegetables what are you a baby that's vegetables are good for you right that's what everybody immediately thinks I don't know if that's true though I don't know that's true one of the things that Shaun Baker said is that they were they're doing tests at Harvard with with people who are on this diet for six months or more I don't know I'm interested so I did some blood work today and I'll make that blood work public that's cool yeah I mean especially if there's anything wacky with it but then I'm gonna do it again at the end of the month and I'll compare Wow that's gonna be a long month I think because I know little Kido I got so bored all my kids are bored we're not eating steak again like you don't have to eat steak I have to eat steak you can eat whatever you want we'll figure this out we'll work it out how many ounces of meat a day do you know like what you're up to like well a four the good thing is I have a lot of elk that's good but I'm running through it you know I'm eating some big-ass chunks of meat is there something that you go to a lot like chicken wings or something like that just because it's easy no eggs makes it really easy to digest too I just kind of go down eggs are great you know I wish that coyotes weren't real most fucks you know that's one of the things that James Wilkes from the game-changers told me where they were doing those regenerative farms where they have these free-range chickens and this is how we're gonna get our eggs he told me they were losing like thousands and thousands of chickens to Eagles he said it was so many I forget I wish I could remember what the number was I'll ask him but some insane amount of death was caused by the Eagles realizing they could just get a chicken everyday-- just swoop in and get a chicken they're so easy they can't even fly and they're all in one there's one pending area I think great video I want to see that there's got to be a video that Jamie thank you of course you are do you subscribe to that Instagram nature's metal oh yeah oh yeah we promoted that that's scary thank you the wolf with the dogs I tried to tell everybody about that yeah when the wolves get sad nature's metals one the best accounts on it all-you-can-eat buffet bald eagles prey on farmers chickens apparently when Eagles find out where your chickens are you're fucked man cuz coyotes at least you can put up a fence he'd have dogs 2.2 million oh my god farmer wins case we scroll up a case against now after losing 2.2 million dollars worth of chickens to bald eagles 2.2 million dollars in chickens 160,000 chickens to Eagle hoodie with rosin how crazy is that and Eagles Eagles no you can't fuck with them that's the difference if a coyote eats your chicken you could shoot him the dick nobody cares everybody wants you to shoot coyotes they'll go after your kids they'll kill your cat but Eagles that's America bro you can't shoot an eagle fuck your chicken maybe that's why maybe he might have one I'm trying to figure out why he won a lawsuit but maybe it's because he couldn't protect them to complete guess that's out what it was saying he's allowed to kill Paul the eagle yeah because they're protected bald eagles so I couldn't do anything about that I guess now our bald eagles protected because they're very rare or is it because they're very rare and there are United States bird like you know they were trying to there's one thought at one point time of make puppy the united states bird or the united states animal it was a pitbull not a puppy it was a pitbull yeah it was in the early the early days of the country I thought it was like recently police concern so they're protected but they're of least concern especially in some areas apparently in Alaska brink of extinction in the late 20th century it says uh huh that's what it is brink of X X is extra patient extra yeah in the contiguous United States so that means Alaska is worth a big amount of them transferred to a list in 1995 transferred to the list of endangered species and was removed from the list of endangered and threatened wildlife in contiguous states On June 28 2007 their flying monsters that's our bird you see the one video of the the eagle I think it was like a not a cow and they're just like rolling down the hill constant go go yeah and pulls the goat off the rocks bashes his brains in on the cat on the rocks on the way down he rough rides him down to even got fucked up a little bit it looked like what is some what was the original those aren't even heavy those Eagles are really light man really yeah they're like ten pounds that's they can kill a wolf they grab a sheep and fly with them look how that is real dude that's real now that's that Photoshop you come on make it real it's not a real Eagle that's photos right there's no way you can get that picture man there's the less the lighting so they're that white shit come on let's make it real why can't that be real come on if there was a GoPro that was that close to that that'd be the girl on the Internet oh it's a wrap bitch the one word he's holding a fish oh that's fake these some of these look fake yeah that one looks like a I bought the thing is the ones that you'll really looks like it's not really a bald eagle doing it it's a golden eagle yeah yeah yeah it's bad daddy go scurrying Andy Rock or Chris Rock what a crazy animal to have is our number one animal I mean it's such a emotionless ruthless beasts like a wolf would be so much better wolves are cool right how old it look at you you can make a deal with them you know they make a deal with the wolf that's how wolf became dogs humans made deals with them Ryder come here man don't eat me I'll give you some of this I shot at a buffalo we could all eat bro you tell me when other fucking asshole wolves are coming by I'll keep you hooked up at Buffalo there's that photo somebody posted recently have a woman that had a like half wolf half timber wolf do you see that and it was like 2 SOT 2 like it was a bigger than her oh yeah it was I look like a monster and it was even a real wolf it was just a half wolf well a lot of those half wolves or whatever they are man that's that's a strong gene that wolf gene if you mix it with a husky you know the big man and some Huskies are big there it is so that's how much wolf does it's a timber wolf is that says Colorado wolf in wildlife so that's a real wolf dude that's a wolf at the same one anything but look how big that goddamn thing is if that thing's imagine if that was a rat and it was trying to kill you well Wolf's are way scarier than rats yeah look at the size of that thing man it's got a collar on it though no is that a collar looks like I call a it looks like something's around its neck right all right yeah no no maybe not it's just the way it is Epstein oh my god it's licking her Oh would you do if she just reaches down starts jerking just said video going around they'll go for the break with that guy has a pet tiger and it comes out of me just like sticks his hand in its mouth oh stop it doesn't just pet I can't does that motherfucker not know about Siegfried and Roy how does he not know about Siegfried and Roy don't do that hey um what do we know about the the bounty I saw that with that we were looking at before we were looking at Sun you were trying to figure out whether what was it that we're trying to figure out was actually true 80 million dollars bounty is that what it was I heard earlier it was 50 million but let me check listen if nobody pays 80 then you know someone comes along this hey I wanna do it for 45 yeah an eighty million dollar bounty on Trump George Lopez jokes will do it for half so funny I guess you're not allowed to say that on the president someone at the funeral said that if they bring him his head at eighty million dollars whoa eighty million citizens contribute a dollar oh no sorry if they did it's what it said someone stole that so if each of the country's 80 million citizens contributed $1 there'd be an eighty million dollar reward for anyone who brings us Trump's head George Lopez says will do it for half that's the sort of comic says folks that's funny any other time it's you know what man when anybody could be the president right in this is sort of manner is it really the same thing to threaten the president like is it is it the same thing as threatening Lincoln is it is it the same thing to threaten Trump in a joke to threaten a guy just think about it who was a former game show host who's a no turd noted baller right character and many many rap songs because of his balling and he likes to talk shit on Twitter you can't make a joke you can't make that joke like that will do it for half you can't make that joke some of the rap guys have got in trouble for what they've been saying in their songs though I know but that's a weird one I mean he's still the president and as much as I know but that's where it's weird yeah it's like what does that mean what does that mean it means you're better than everybody everybody definitely better than everybody I can't pretend we're gonna kill you even talking about I think you can get in trouble what happened to Kathy Griffin when she showed that rubber head she had that rubber Trump head nothing right she got suspended from Twitter she lost her career no no no she can get suspended from Twitter they gave her a bump in the algorithm did fuck her career did it yeah a lot of cancellations up shows I'm sure yeah I think she took some time off - yeah that's weird nobody thought Kathy Griffin was really gonna murder Trump right right and was in place yeah type thing it might have been in poor taste especially since she knew him and she was on his show all of it is crazy man it's also crazy um what else is going on how much see anything good in the movies I haven't dude I haven't done the movies in a long time I don't do movies anymore I don't give up I don't even do like Netflix shows anymore I do a lot of YouTube stuff now and like documentaries on YouTube I'm worried about that what I'm worried about that that people are just gonna only watch a little bit and saw uncut gems Adam Sandler's new movie Oh what is that that's a it's good say it's a movie right yeah Julia he plays a demon a degenerate gambler that works in a diamond district in New York and has a event like a crazy night it's good it was pretty good yeah I mean if you don't understand gambling and stuff like that there might be you might find inconsistencies like you have with some others other like movies I heard it's cut really the movie was frantic good I like the I like the movie as far as the movie was was a enjoyable two hours at the theater that company 8:24 has been putting out some awesome movies they did a couple ones I've seen this year I just kind of sort of noticed that that company does them I don't really know who's behind it or anything but they did some other like summer time movie which is about some cult and like Poland or something or some girl goes and like she gets kidnapped and shit that was a pretty cool movie didn't hear anything about that really I've seen some of the memes about it since then but like randomly wouldn't sell it at the ArcLight and I was like that was a really good movie actually yeah I'd heard that Adam Sandler is a really good actor yeah her it's great I mean you guys think he's been doing so many silly movies I heard it's edited weird though like it's like frantic editing or something I wouldn't it wasn't that weird now compared to like her other movies like was the one that Christopher Nolan movie where the guy has tattoos everything at memento we're talking about you know like like that or not I can't pay attention or anything I love that maybe momenta that was a weird one he's got a new movie coming out that look cool called Tennant it's all about time and the way time works and some soldiers going back and forth in a time and like the trailer looked fucking crazy I couldn't explain off the trailer but it's coming out soon let me ask you both are you guys worried about Iran not you worried about what's happening here you worried about these military people making joint exercise when that happened what was interesting I was gonna bring up is that the LAPD's made some tweets that they're gonna like we're watched in LA I'm saying kiss everybody's worried and they're like what are you talking about like I don't know just we're just paying attention huh okay I'm not worried about it as much as previous types of stuff that's happened like what you know like with like North Korea or worried more about North Korea as more worried more about North Korea cuz that's act an actual threat from I think a crazy person and where IRA Angra brand they're just gonna try to kill Trump I don't think they're gonna necessarily like bro they killed Trump it's going to be chaos yeah I don't think I don't know I don't think they're gonna be able to do that I think if anything this is the worst part has already happened maybe I don't think so I think there's gonna be some sort of retaliation funeral that they showed me people were there yeah Chevy showed up so I noticed goddamn American truck what white white why does this one concern you so much than like you know because it seems like this is the first example of someone being impulsive someone making this kind of a decision that maybe strategy experts and real military experts would have had some real good I mean this is just speculating but that they would have some real good reasons or this is a terrible idea and there are other methods of working things out that it doesn't have to go this way it doesn't have to be and this is not a movie this is real life and yeah but do you think they're just gonna force him out then like this is what samus seems like it's too good to be true for people that hate Trump sort of but then if something happens here's the thing if something happens something horrible happens see the way America is like we are like we have the genes of this wild Conqueror just lust for travel human that was willing to get on a fucking boat and make it over here from Europe and from where every other place and then the slaves that were dragged in here against their own will and then the other people that were imprisoned here and they were and then the Native Americans who got pushed out and the Mexicans got put that's this is all thousands of years of genes right the moment something goes crazy that's what all that stuff comes out like you remember how people were when 9/11 happened everybody had an American flag on their car man everywhere it became an intense place place where you like you you just that that whole break glass in case of war like that's real if someone provokes someone does something where we feel like we're really at war we're gonna unite we're gonna unite in a crazy way and the thing is a lot of people gonna love it then feel great that we're united against an evil cause I mean this is this is why people have employed that strategy to convince their people to get into war I mean Hitler did it right didn't Hitler he burned the Reichstag right that was he did that in order to get people more enthusiastic about his plans I'm pretty sure he did that and I think Nero did that with Rome as well but I'm an idiot and my memory is faulty you know way more than anybody know before we definitely know and an arson attack was performed on the Reichstag building oh so was arson so they think he did it in order to get people Pumped up like look the Fuhrer was right mm-hmm man I've been in the the middle of this fourth Native American book this blood and thunder book that just happened like the the reason why I'm worried is not just because of the news and not just but also because of these goddamn books with talks about the Native American interactions with the soldiers and the settlers it's fuck that is in our genes man it just happened people were horrible they did horrible thing and it shatters this notion that so many of us love to hold on to that without the Europeans here the Native Americans live peacefully they didn't live peacefully with each other no one ever has the Native Americans so lauder teach other they took each other slave they killed each other they tortured each other the Comanches were known for it I mean it's a horrific here in the story horrific what the soldiers did to horrific with the human beings of that era when forced into that conflict were willing to do and what they were willing to become that is not that long ago man that's why I'm scared well I'm scared because I feel like we've come so far it's so safe it's so safe that people don't even like saying that it's safe we like we like to be in denial about it and focus on so much of the inequality the inequity inadequacies and all the problems and the violence and though this and than that and they're right about all those things but goddamn this is a soft time to live and if some shit hits the fan you're all gonna know that when you're really worried about your life every day when your loved ones really could get shot and killed by someone who's a mile away with a scope because that's what's been going on if that's what it comes down to you're gonna understand how soft we had it you're gonna really know how soft we had it and this is that cycle that everybody says right hard times make strong men strong men make easy times easy times make weak men this is a common it's just how human beings are we need a motivation to kick ass we need we need some reason to rise to the top we need some reason to go out there and conquer and that was the best reason is if we get attacked if we get attacked we're gonna go crazy it's gonna be horrible I'm really scared like I'm like legitimately worried that people some people are losing their grip on what violence actually means and what war actually means because it's not happening over here and because it doesn't happen over here the only ones that can tell us are the ones that went over there the ones went over there and come back they do not paint pretty stories they paint stories of ugly people in danger people and they're like you got to be village' because you got to be diligent and you got to be vigilant because this world is not what you think it is there's a lot of parts of this world that are fucking chaos written and filled with crime and filled with murder and filled with death and filled with despair and there's money there and there's terrorists and there's these religious fundamentalists who want to throw gay people off roofs and that shit's real that's happening in 2020 right now somewhere in the world they're probably planning on throwing a gay guy off a roof who because some some person wrote that down 2,000 years ago or whatever it was fuck I was ice fishing I can't believe you went on that ice man was disconcerting was that scary it's almost as disconcerting is like thinking about whether or not I should fart like whenever you like this could be a bad idea like walking with this diet walking out onto that ice it was only four inches thick I was like whoo it's fun though didn't make the cracking sound when you know it's solid as fuck there's a lot of people out there to me my friend Brent went and caught a couple rainbow trout it's nice ate it for for lunch there's weird though it's a weird activity freezing your ass off and you're standing still I don't like shit we stand still like my least favorite way of hunting is in a tree stand just sitting around but it's also it's kind of crazy when it happens like if you're hunting a deer in a tree stand it's most of the time you're just trying to keep your shit together like you might stick standstill for eight hours just stand still or sit down depending on how you do it some people lean against a tree you're harnessed in there's a bunch of different kinds of stands some stands you stand on some stands you sit down on something some are homemade and you just is just a mind game just to sit and wait sit and wait sit don't make no sound so the deer don't know you're there and then they walk through going to their normal corridors and you're gonna all whine which mother while they're walking a lot of time to stop them you have to stop them you know Matt no and they turn back you hit him with an arrow it's weird that's the but that's that sit and still shit in the cold oh I don't like doing that when you move around the Colts not that bad like if you have to go somewhere and you're well protected like I went skiing past weekend and I had face mask on that's a game changer son neoprene face mask if you're going skiing oh that's a game changer I was like they had the holes for the mouth so I could breathe I was like this is a game changer now I'm not cold like I'm not even cold first time you ever ever yeah to tell you about it no I just thought but I have gone out without goggles and your face gets burnt yeah it's weird your face gets burnt and your eyes don't look so good either it's like this is not good for my eyes I'm like staring a light bulb yeah really it's very bright up yeah that's under my eyes before I couldn't see for days yeah that's a real thing right it's called snow blindness right yeah I wiped out though hard I was a little worried this lady lost control in front of me around I was gonna run a current corner and this lady just slid right into traffic just went sideways just didn't have she's probably just start it looked like she was just starting out and I tried to avoid her and true-life lost my left leg I went flying up and then I hit my head bang like had a helmet on of course snow wasn't really too hard packed but it was a good ding like I got a little dizzy and I was like oh shit that's some brain damage I didn't need so do you always wear a helmet always yeah you don't want to die remember wearing a helmet bro you could die you could die pretty easy without a helmet you definitely could I could have died from that even with a helmet people fall and hit their head and they die I mean I'm not I'm I'm not worried that I was gonna die when I fell I don't want to get you wrong but some people would have died from that same thing like an older person or a person with an issue I think Liam Neeson's wife it's a woman created oil oranges new block son's here her son passed away yes yeah twenty did what he was in a skiing accident right yeah intermediate hill I think what he did he hit true no I think that's what Sonny did right hit a tree Sonny Bono hit a tree so did one of the Kennedys who bro skiing is dangerous you're taking these crazy risks all these people that might not know how to ski you know fun beautiful up there very fun very fun very beautiful up there fun times it's good family thing and I think it's really good for kids to learn like the kind of chaos that comes from skiing down a hill that's chaotic man did they snowboard or ski like I've grown at all yeah this ski and this ski like a grown adult and then tubing is another thing that's fun that's moving that's the tubing is no risk though you don't learn the lessons you learn from skiing skiing you learn how to keep your shit together cuz you're you're in control no one's holding your hand you're going down this fucking stupid blue hill when you're not really ready for it and you got to go sideways slightly sideways sideways I was fine I was doing good to the last day some lady loses her shit right in front of me 90s when skiing was more like a cocaine party event he moves to the set of tubes I don't think they have lots of tubes out there but they would take this cafeteria trays and just slide out on those hmm you know crazy fucking college kids but yeah cafeteria trays are good arms can lids cardboard boxes like a big refrigerator box jump on that bitch to slide down a hill the problem with that is nothing guy died out there recently two in Utah from in the same area from avalanches this dickhead wanted to go off-road and sorry dickhead it's hard to call him a dickhead rather sure he's just a man man with dreams into a co Pro dudes wanna you know they want to make those videos and look like badasses they tell you never to do that to feel bad for call him dickhead just a figure of speech folks there's a lot of those guys like one guy that was on the show once with the rock climber Oh a personal yeah that he's been on twice no yeah he scares the shit out of me too I've been watching a bunch of these videos YouTube started recommending them to me and I watch that that's like two weeks ago I watched like four or five in a row I watched like two hours of Alex climbing these horrific fucking Mountain that even thinking about it right now my hands start sweating imagine finding yourself halfway up and not wanting to do it anymore and you have this life-changing moment like I don't want to do this anymore well you gotta keep going bitch fuck I like the trail running videos were there on the spine of a mouse oh no no I don't like that at all I don't like that at all I can barely stay upright when I'm running on a regular trail I think they have that new workout machine not the Pentagon or whatever it's called but the other one where it shows no with the fucking Bell Mathon but they have the other new one where it's like it's like where you're jogging on the side of a mountain or something like that oh yeah yeah yeah yeah they it's like that yeah one of those like forty percent incline and yeah that is cool yeah well there's something about it like I've I've done elliptical machines that show you a trail like when I was in Hawaii the gym had this elliptical machine and you can start running a trail and while you're doing that it feels like you're getting somewhere yeah but there's something different when you're like literally walking up to Runyon and you have all you're like looking at the dust and you're gonna die and then you turn around and you see the entire skyline of Los Angeles you win miles and mile yeah yeah you way better yeah that's better you're right 100% er elliptical that's is that a thing you know they were gonna they were gonna they had this thing called the unidirectional treadmill and the way it works is like it's like that other treadmill that we have the air runner when the air runner you do it by using your own feet to propel it they'll have that with a unidirectional treadmill and then you'll be harnessed in at the waist so there'll be some sort of cables and some sort of a suspension system so that you can't ever actually fall out of it but you won't feel it too much while you're just running around I was just sort of like roughly guides your treadmill and which way you want to go but you always you always go you never hit anything you never run in and it still seems nauseating somehow for surely your body's gonna be so confused it's gonna be weird man but it's it's the future how are you getting one step closer I don't know how much it's gonna be announced at CES this weekend but I've saw these gloves a couple weeks ago or they're like I believe the first haptic feedback gloves for VR and development you're gonna put them right on your deck right yeah how much virtual reality porn is there it's still not good well tell me I don't know like it's uh it's not it doesn't I don't know it doesn't feel that insane as you think it would be amazing sitting there but you then half the time videos you're like wait I'm the woman and I have the boobs no way oh really yeah it's like you look down like you're lesbian you watch your whites other lesbians is that what it is or guys fucking you and so that's what I want that's not what you want yeah you can't look down here from the guy either yeah someone's got to make an interactive one and I don't know that sounds very difficult to do yeah just stop thinking about like you can watch a video but watch me if you want to grab something and have a reaction to happen like no program that if Iran really wants a cripple our world that's what they'll develop that game think about how people can't put down road blocks or our fucking candy crush what other wacky games people can't leave alone just imagine how bad it would be if that thing made you come a game that makes you come great the better you do the better it feels when this game sucks your dick do you know good people be at that game is there a limit per day of them okay think about how difficult it is right for for someone to get so good at BMX riding that people want to fuck you not saying it's impossible it's possible for sure that a lot of like the high level BMX guys girls just throw themselves at them right guys a savage out there doing flips and shit think of how good you have to get at that before someone actually wants to suck your dick you got to get really good right for that being the reason why they want to have sex with you that's the reason so now think about it let's cut the human choice thing out of it and make it just a level that you have to reach in this video game make it just you have to be really good at this video game and then this Russian robot lady sucks your dick but you feel it in real life deal good kids would get at it or it'd be the fastest hacked game of all time right because unless we connected it to some sort of fucking blockchain grid that's impenetrable and that's the only way you could get out the the Russian fuck doll that's the only way you acted Millions is a day fast you can't hack you can't hack you have to show your skill at every level like a speed wash as a speedrun no just I'm just trying to think is there a way to not hack that you're a fatalist you've killed my dreams yeah we were talking about prostitution earlier that would be like how are you gonna stop that how you gonna stop that if you say you can't pay for sex okay but can I pay for a thing that feels exactly like sex and I think it's sex while I'm doing it or is it like if you get into a simulation the simulation lets you murder people and then you come out of the simulation like hey you're going to jail like what there wasn't even a real person yeah but you're the kind of piece of shit that if that situation happened you would kill somebody you just killed somebody and you even know as a simulation therefore you're a piece of shit that's a thought crime we can't pay but you can give gifts right straight again you can you could be I'm a happy fat I like to give away money to my personal girls you need to get your toes done I need to get my cock sock what do you say I don't think you'd spell it out I don't think you could say like hey I'll give you this Ferrari if you fuck me first and if you're Bill Gates you might want to just throw it starts throwing Ferraris around yeah well I know is you got 90 billion Derek you gave away that's a nice gift back for everyone that's hilarious sign baby that was just a nice consolation prize thanks for fucking being I'll see you later the thing about girls never have to feel bad about banging their fans like if if someone like Miley Cyrus wanted to start fucking her way through the hottest guys that like her everybody be like you go girl imagine Miley Cyrus started giving out gift bags every time she fucked dudes hey thanks for the dick have yourself a little fucking nut cake have a fruitcake this is my favorite vegan coconut drink see ya left by the door kick rocks kick rocks you pervert you heard that Instagram girl but that uh she got banned from Instagram she was like Instagram chick and so she got to like help out she's decided to put out for ten dollars she'll send you a naked picture in like in like a one week I think she's made like seven hundred thousand dollars for donations for the Australian fires yeah for the Australian fires but she's kicked off of Instagram for that no no I think she got kicked off at Instagram and so in Ritchie's like you know what I'm just gonna start selling pictures of me naked then yeah I think Instagram purred to have her back on she's doing a lot of good yeah they should for real she's raised that much money to help the Australian wildlife yeah they deactivated her account it says come on man that's you violated rules about sexual content come on she's doing it for a good cause you fucks let her be naked what are you stopping her from being naked for you creeps why does Twitter let you be naked but it's just what is better yeah the naked philanthropist she's only 20 oh poor girl doesn't know what she's doing it I'm sending nudes to every person who donates at least $10 to any one of these fundraisers for wildfires in Australia every $10 you donate equals one nude picture from me to your DM you must send any confirmation that you don't need that girl does not have a lot of hobbies let's take a hammer she does not have the free time damn she's hot though look at that those are definitely real she raised more than five hundred thousand dollars that's amazing let her back Instagram come on but she said she was gonna give the money to that and she didn't show pictures right it says she was sending him do sex work I guess I mean you're missing a transit I would imagine SRIA Lee because Instagram wasn't getting a cut yeah they're getting a dollar out of every transaction may be as loose why snapchat has like snap caps on how yeah they don't have a PayPal thing and built-in and do you think that's what are you that cynical I've heard them do that for other things that's what a lot of the ad changes were about and why they don't let influencers do ad things anymore because they're not getting a piece wait a minute they don't never like why there have been a bunch of changes oh because they're not getting a piece of these all those ad sales it's going directly through the influencer you know that's just what I've read online hey interesting cynicism yeah whenever I see one of those sponsored ads one huh trampling here yeah you're supposed to put that hashtag ad after everything like weird is weird ads are weird like dudes like holding up a CBD bomb or the rubber leg it's weird you know it's like social media the ability to make money on social media is so new no one knows what to do with it and it's like porn this is why it's like porn the fucking the the people in porn always figure out first how to push the boundaries of the technology like technology when it comes like streaming streaming video high resolution video all that stuff like that's all pushed a lot of its push by porn yeah just the amount of bandwidth involved in porn off the charts this is like that don't you think they must have figured out password-protected content first because there's a bunch hidden that's not free you know like there's a pay version of those sites and there's a free version but I don't know how they figured I don't know how you hang off those things who would go to pet you'd be a serious pervert to say what what's out available online it's just not enough for my tastes I forget somebody we know very well I feel damn it has an account yeah he's just told me he's like oh yeah I'd like to support like Oh supports the artist you want to marry one with nothing wrong with that some people are in that shit they're like what'd you do today honey show me your work oh you bad girl you bad girl they took all those dicks some guys like that you're a bad girl I'm a bad girl daddy won't take one more dick I'll take you for ya if Starbucks start giving me free coffee I don't think anybody's gonna keep paying for it what they hmm would think knew there was going to help Guatemala or something don't you think know what you think if it was like only one kind of coffee you know what I mean like like if you couldn't get free iced coffees or a Micawber's or lesbian coffee yeah no Sophie let's look at only get decaf for free oh yeah fuck is that I was at a place the other did it only a decaf espresso it's all they had like we only have decaf espresso I'm like who the fuck drinks decaf espresso cuz espresso you can't even pretend it's worth it for those little bitter sit there's still a little bit out there there's a little bit yeah but it's real small right yeah but like the idea of an espresso is everybody thinks espresso is way stronger than it is yeah it's not that strong yeah less liquid I just like the flavor of it but I like to know that it's got a little jolt to it I feel like an asshole if I was doing a decaf express isn't that weird like regular espresso seems totally normal but decaf Express some like why it's just because people for health reasons like my mom can't drink caffeine so no because it gives her hot like heart palpitations and shit like that it's about the amount that's in decaf it's that's like so small it doesn't matter really yeah so she's not small you guys I saw some people are you know some companies gonna stop or testing people for nicotine usage I forget which one and then people were been like oh there's nicotine and all these foods you're gonna have to test them for that every smart people like yes it's in there but it's so minimal that like you have to eat thousands of egg plants to get one pack of cigarettes like five seats thousands yeah so your mom would happen so she gets only decaf espresso yeah because she loves the taste of coffee but she can't have caffeine she likes this press although yeah hmm and I guess it tastes the same just it's like there's a bunch of different kinds of espresso all right these different beans and shit like some people make it like super bitter those the people that love doing that cranky machine to pop it in there and crank and tap it down I like those Nespresso capsules pop those bitches and enough to think too much meanwhile this Turtles out there choking the desk probably right it's aluminum though it's not not plastic but still fuck Turtles man when's the last time you saw a turtle I just saw a turtle in Hawaii okay so once but you see straws every day the courtesy straws more yeah [Laughter] the problem really is waste management that's the problem how the fuck does the waste get in the ocean in the first place you tell me it's inevitable that everyone's so gross that all the garbage has to get in the ocean no matter what I don't think that's true I think we need to do a way better job of collecting garbage and treating garbage and treating our own garbage and just come up with a more comprehensive plan to avoid all this shit getting into the ocean this is not enough funding in order time and grete Thornburg it's only 16 she can only do so much it's to feed it to pigs before they figured out landfills oh really did they yeah it's all everything they'd everything as much as they could I think wow the restaurant should be fine they should I got sick families made I think it was Ari it was either Ari or Kalin might have been Kalin they told me they were in China and there was a restaurant that had a toilet and the toilet was a hole Ari it was it all right yeah but in nono but in the hole at the bottom was pigs he's shitting into a pigsty and the pigs would eat your shit and that this is common cool I'm pretty sure it was Kalin what in the fuck Ari definitely told me he had a shit into a hole yeah yeah they also got chased out of a Chinese girl's house by a man with a baseball bat right and it's something about street oil or something like that like the food was cooked using like the oil from oh that's it different that's a different story there's a story that I almost forgot about you just said that that's the story of them that's what already brought yes yes sewer wall sewer water but they were making cooking oil at a sewer water there's literally people going into the sewer and turning that shit water in the cooking oil I know you're saying there's no way it makes sense it course the agents doing that no my girlfriend is agent and she's like the grossest shit ever like blood soup view from the inside of a pig toilet so there it is it's kind of cool look at that I won't have that pig thing sees the minority village somewhere in Yunnan Province China the pig followed me to the toilet position itself under it waiting I was very confused when I started using toilet paper for reasons oh my god because it was licking his asshole I just go at it and like pig toilet just start coming up I tried to shit right now the pigs face that is so gross but now go see if you find cooking oil made from sewage done ton time I know a lot of people like wait what no I think it was Vice I think vice had a video on it and it was all about how there is a market for people making cooking oil in these really poor towns they literally climb into the sewers and they take out human shit and turn into cooking oil got our oil they call it gutter oil get her disgusting recycled oil and sewage illicit cooking oil which has been recycled from waste oil collected from sources such as restaurant fires grease traps slaughterhouse waste and sewage from sewer drains look at that one on the far right says Chinese gutter oh you click on that disgusting this is the video that I've seen before recycled oil and sewage is used to cook Chinese Street food Jesus Christ bro they get into the potty and then they they filter all the poop out and they get the oil these filters get the oil out of the poop and then they cook your noodles in that whoa that's why we need regulation would you taste it that's why no yeah that's why we need America Young Turks it was them they'd get one too oh yeah definitely yeah this guy opens up or his woman rather opens up oh and she scooped it out a young church stuff from Artie or whatever it's called you whitey yeah is that the Russian that's a different no what's the Russian thing that started all that propaganda again so that's internet research agency the IRA against who 5g where they were saying like five g's bad for you they do that yeah did that I think so man the 5g shit like that propaganda is and scary interesting its article it says Artie no Artie it's been sowing disinformation so Artie has been so yes they're the ones I started all this shit because I guess it's suppose I've G phone won't hurt you but Russia wants you to think otherwise okay a network known for salt sowing disinformation has a new alarm the coming 5g apocalypse who is this New York Times you know yeah it's interesting he said New York Times because in New York Times if they're printing something like that's one of the places that are kind of site if they're saying it it's probably true didn't you see what they did the Jenk Genki ogre from The Young Turks he was interviewing David Duke and he goes of course you're not a racist amake mocking him and they took it out of context in quotes and they wrote that he said to David Duke of course you're not a racist they try to pretend somebody just got to woke for their own good somebody crossed the line they crossed the line they want to stop him they wanted to stop him and so they got over woke they lied that's crazy that's a crazy lie though for that to get into the New York Times I wonder what the fall fallout from that was cuz that's for them that's got to be very embarrassing that someone actually printed that if they were forced to make a retraction but the problem with that is when people hear about stuff like that it you know there's a lot of people obviously working into New York Times a lot of people so it doesn't represent everybody there but when someone gets away with something sneaky like that it really fucks over everybody else because then all the other people that are making stories people gonna go yeah you're the fucking people that said that jank yogurt said you know David Duke wasn't a racist when that's clearly not what he said your fucking magazines fake news it's all bullshit you got a shit newspaper congratulations you're gonna fuel that and the New York Times used to have none of that right at least have none of that they should a correction that doesn't mean anything I don't say anything else from that if the corrections too late it's in a newspaper how many Corrections a a year did they do is what I would like to know well how many people read the correction versus read the original story that's what gets real weird like if you make something up about someone then put it down or make something and interpret it incorrectly on purpose and intentionally and then you put it out there how much responsibility does the newspaper have and how much responsibility does that writer out for doing that they probably don't like him they don't want him to do it they figured like fuck this guy let's just he fucking said it did he actually say it he did say it I don't know what he meant do you know what he meant I fucking print it I don't know I don't know what the process was but yeah I can't do that if you want us to take you seriously but there's still one of that number one I stood oh yes I take him seriously most of time I Saturn there was another one they did with Conor McGregor back when Conor McGregor fought Floyd and they said his face was bloodied and I'm like no it wasn't he didn't have any blood he wasn't making things up you can't make things up did they retract that yeah they did cuz you said it they did but they had to everybody saw it you know the arrogance that you have to have to pretend that you saw something that wasn't there or either that or you're paying attention so loosely before you write this story so you don't even give a fuck out if I went and you're gonna report in the fight you're gonna stop you're the New York Times you're not a podcast get a podcast Muncie and spread misinformation and talk stupid shit that's the difference like nobody takes us seriously they take the fucking New York Times seriously you have to you got a serious job okay it's like if you're a cop you know you got a serious job you're a reporter reporting the actual news got a serious job because you can you can change the way people look at things and it might be a lie and that's that got us into a lot of problems in the past people always think they know better though they know better than what everybody else wants that's that's where it's a real problem you think you're doing good by withholding information or you think you're doing good by censoring people you get your news mostly from like Twitter or something I don't get my news from anywhere anymore I feel great I looked at a newspaper the other day I picked it up and I'm like what happened over there hmm I forget what it was about there was a story about something and I was like I didn't know that I read into a little bit was in The Wall Street Journal I was like I got other shit to think about it's a terribly irresponsible way to look at things but it's a clear I don't know I don't know if you can do that much I don't know what the responsibility is like ultimately to completely pay attention to everything all the time I don't know what responsibilities you have people get mad at you if you don't completely take pay attention to everything that's of importance all the time and they had a point they have a point but you also have a point for like self management and for mental management to probably pay attention to less shit I feel like a I feel healthier and happier when I pay attention to less shit so I this I ran things got me fucked up cuz if something makes me think about it that means it's in the forefront of the news now it's like big it's a big deal I'm like oh dude do you see that fucking that the mean that someone made and they put up on Instagram about a day after world feminists the day after World War three starts it's it's the old timey 1950s lady in the oven baking she's got a apron on and shit she's got the oven door open she's making some ice cookies for all these these teeny tiny whiny beta males that have been posturing for attention and virtue signaling and what a rude awakening it's gonna be if war breaks out war war is a scary shit of all time that people are so convinced that no matter besides all the other threats that face us disease and injury and accidents death and all this other shit that we're absolutely convinced that we're always gonna have war okay I never met any one person and things we're never gonna have war again have you there's never been a time where you gonna move Canada maybe Canada no not bad especially they light this place up so I still lean towards Texas or Colorado Texas is a good move I like Texas Texas is good move to if you don't want to fuck with the winter yeah god I just can't do the fucking snow there's humidity that's rough yeah gets real rough down by the ocean like Houston area that gets rough in the summer I remember that fuck that we'd be there in like July and August go fuck it gets hot yeah I'll be there too in two days but you're doing Cal Tony's oh well which party shows a secret group and the lol comedy club in San Antonio how's the scene in Houston these days Houston's great with that would they have the secret group which is a an amazing club that's owned by a bunch of comics Oh beautiful we're gonna have skank fest there oh this is my year too so when is that I want to say it's February March around that area orange beautiful yeah so that'd be good it's nice to see like scenes yeah you know scenes staying a lot like that was like an ember for a while they had a fucking great scene at the laughs stop man a lot of people aren't they don't remember you know we have to talk about it for people to get an understanding of what it was like then when they had that really good open mic that went like all night yeah I love that place this was awesome and then that place across the street we ate at B bus or whatever then yeah tres yeah the thing about that place was that the dude who ran it was just too crazy he was too crazy mm-hmm he just just just too much drugs too much chaos too much and then the other guy took over and tried to make it a little corporate and then it was like wow this kind of existed the way it was before because a crazy person ran it you know a lot of in a lot of ways like the store the stores figured out the sweet balance though she's letting crazy people run it but also have like a business mind and like keeping it together but just saying oh no this is an interesting business deal but this is bit basically the best way to make it run can't beat the store I love it it's the best but you know like I remember I'd heard that Jean Garofalo had moved to Houston that might be fake news but I was in Boston and I remember seeing Wyatt I'm like who the fuck is in Houston and Kinnison was in Houston and Bill Hicks was in Houston so Houston at one point in time was a hub man like there was some beasts coming out of he particularly Kennison when Kinnison bursts out of Houston everybody was like holy shit the best comic in the world came from Texas how the fuck cuz for those two years that Kinnison was on top he was a fucking tornado man he was a torn he was just ripping houses out of the foundations and throwing them through the air and that was all from Texas so I'd heard a bunch of people had moved down there cuz this is like I want to say like late 80s like like late 80s early 90s like innocent die die thinking like 91 or 92 or something like that but Texas Austin has a really good scene - Austin Dallas like all of Texas always has - have you ever thought about moving into Texas or is it yes yeah I love it there me too I fucking love it there if the shit hit the fan in California yeah ha I'm gonna get a ranch whoo live from the ranch the new Jerry yeah fuck the cowboy hat on a snake tie you meat all day barbeque maybe I don't know how long it seems to have subsided but for a couple of days it was literally touch-and-go like my dick would like tingle a little bit my butt hole would pucker up and I go oh you better keep that vault shot it'll be like try explaining to someone who's never taken a shit what it feels like if you know you have diarrhea but you haven't experienced a you know that feeling like how sensitive is the inner wall of your your bottle ticking time-bomb because you know what's gonna happen - right but if you don't know you have diarrhea you know that there's moments where you like oh this is not good what came out of nowhere well you think you have it like you're like I gotta get to a toilet immediately like there's an urgency to the feeling that you have like your buttholes like yeah you like what's going on around there guys and you know like I gotta get to a bathroom right now you don't even know why you know I'll give you how to describe so - someone tell me what it's like when you know you're about to have explosive diarrhea what's the feeling pressure pressure that's not good that sounds like you're getting birth it sounds like you had a rock in your pocket it's more than pressure there's a heat you know the heat that you feel like sometimes you got hot diarrhea like the inside of your butthole heats up and you're like whoa this is gonna be a problem I love it when it's a suicide bomber when you just sit down actually made it to a toilet that happens when you just fill up that bowl with water yeah I took a shit the third or fourth day of this diet that I took a picture of because of what there was no solid to it it was black splatter oh god yeah I hate when it's black but it was it was so dark it's like like what I would imagine the devil shit was I just want you to know and what you know what kind of kind of stuff I'm dealing with and I want to know what everybody thinks I need to know your opinion I mean is this a deep concern or no should I be concerned what's going on oh god dude that's no no that's that looks like a mouse a computer mouse it's all fluid black fluid dark darling like a Corvette that's because when I said when I Google you know shit problems or say like if it's ever black or if it looks like sand or something like that he's a good dog problems Shaun Baker was telling me that I don't know this is true or not I'll read you what he said because I will definitely butcher this bear in mind he's an actual doctor he is a I mean that's the blackest I've ever seen it and I thought I had black shit before it's not even shit though it's like it slick looks like oil yeah it's a disaster

they bring up photos that guys had to trying to find this picture of a person's tooth and I just typed in teeth our tooth in photos and searched and it found all these peoples like close-ups of their smiles and stuff hmm I didn't know that you can search photos I found this message it says for some reason for some people too many eggs can lead to diarrhea that was on the case of me I wasn't it eating that many eggs hardly any eggs most of time it's just the colon adapting oops I lost it there sorry shit god damn it search for colon adapting you'll get there I had it though 53 messages I don't know if that's true see here's the thing about all this stuff is there's a lot of dispute like a lot a lot of dispute what people think is and isn't true about nutrition and diet like that that is one of the more confusing things about talking to all these different people well what is okay and what's not okay what's healthy what's not healthy how much difference it make biologically between people like healthy for you but not healthy for me is that real like what what how does one find it's a fucking long road to try to sort all this stuff out so when people start talking about like why something gives you I'm like hmm I don't know if that's true it says the Cohens adapting to a relatively higher amount of liquid leaving the small intestine then we're used to on a high-fiber diet I don't know we're gonna find out yeah it seems to me it's just I find it odd that you have diarrhea on a meat diet that's what I'm saying yeah it's just but what he's saying if your colon is used to high-fiber which captivates some of the liquid and then you know it would cause that fiber to swell up and then it comes out in the form of watery shit so instead there's none of that it's just meat so you got the plop plop that's the meat and then everything else is liquid you Yanks are you drinking more liquid to do you think because you're filling space sir I'm definitely drinking a good amount of liquid I'm being healthy about it we bought these body composition scales that you get on but that said I should be 142 pounds and then I'm 59 pounds of fat that's not true yeah so it's a piece of shit yeah those things like I talked to my doctor about today so they're not you said the real ones have a handle there's a handle on one side and then it goes across your body so it gets you from the floor up and it gets you across your body with these wires that you hold on to and it gets a better scan but the best scan is when you go into an immersion tank and then they find out what your body composition is and they there's like more complicated machinery involved too like I know the UFC has some body composition scanner you lay down on this thing that's a different level that's probably the one that works because this though I mean I don't know maybe the one that you step on works maybe but I'm skeptical of the one I got I'm not even say the name of it the one I ordered I order three different ones because I want to see if they were because we're all talking about doing it or he's gonna do it we're gonna do a podcast we're all gonna do a weight-loss podcast because we look so fat and like I said Bari he looked good he wants to lose body fat and he has the bones of a baked chicken his bones just break yeah found out he has inadequate bone mass and he's like okay that's probably why everything breaks when I ski cuz he's broken a bunch of shit skiing his arm his legs ankle um so he's gonna gain some mass and hopefully become more of a man I mean that's the ultimate goal going into this one his ski vidya is pretty amazing if that's him that I think it's Virgil he posted some video I don't know if it's real or fake yeah yeah him skiing oh he gets ski yeah he's ski pretty good he's like going on all the ramps and oh he's been skiing forever or he's been skiing forever that's yeah he knows that's amazing yeah Burke's been don't push up side there kind of push up see what does that kind of push-ups for either do or you don't like Yoda over here there's no want do or don't full extension full extension push-ups not really he's not all those one count Anna you get zero points sir hey get back down there it's a camera trick he's just bringing up a carpet you know so it's trying to lose weight too yeah we're all gonna try to look impressive at the end of February that's the idea you figured that out now just doing it just doing it's better the problem with contests is we all get crazy we don't have time and the contest that's involved between Bert and Tom with just dance-off videos it's getting pretty spectacular I know a few things I'm not telling nobody oh yeah but there's some shit no works it's going down are we going to see you returning to like I love that dancing see no use the curtain swung across the room or something no that was Kevin James yeah that's just hard on you know it takes a lot of energy to learn how to dance and it's some stupid way that nobody gives a fuck about go big on tick tock you go crazy it's hard man I'll tell you that I have a lot of respect for dancers it's fucking hard to do very hard to do I mean the this the physical motion required to move your body like that it's difficult just I get it good I don't like when people try to shame you into doing their thing either and don't like that are you scared you're scared to do a dance-off fuck you alright fuck you I'm not scared do it no one's scared to do a dance-off man it doesn't matter if you dance better okay it's like about all the things it's one of this is not 1970 and this isn't Saturday Night Fever okay okay it's not a valuable commodity I know you wish it was I know you wish it was I know you wish in this day and age that being a great dancer was a valuable commodity but you know how I know it's not because there's no rich professional male dancers that are famous name one with the last one we have was Baryshnikov after that that's it there's no more it's not like you would think about all the famous chefs we have Gordon Ramsay and Anthony Bourdain and the famous celebrity wealthy chefs are a dime a dozen there's a lot of them today Guy Fieri you can keep going Wolfgang Puck you can keep going right name one baller dancer just dancer though just as Michael Jackson and he's dead name one right now Savion Glover who the fuck is bro keep it no disrespect to mr. Glover no disrespect to anybody who bowls professionally yeah but this look you can't nobody gives a fuck so if you try to pretend that it's a big deal like it's not a big deal that's why you can't make a living doing it well I guess you can make a living dancing you certainly can make a living and if that's not the only reason of course I'm joking so the only reason to be a very good dancer you should dance for love dance for the love of your craft but if you try to shame someone and they're not having a dance-off they're gonna go ahead that doesn't mean anything there's a lot of other interesting things you could do with your body you know you can get good at a lot of different movements you brought I don't have to do a fucking hip-hop dance off with you how about no [Music] come on man I want you to listen to music you don't even like and I want you to move in a way that's gonna embarrass the fuck out of you five years from now so go ahead especially what Burt did or but Tom did the Burt oh my god oh my god kind of taking it too far there's any release to behind-the-scenes videos of real reaction to birds video and they're not much better than the reaction that we're in the fucking video where it was acted out the real reactions hurt more because they look at him like they're like what the fuck oh oh that was real that's a real reaction why is everyone trying to hurt Burt because he's a really nice guy I'm trying I'm not trying to hurt I'm not like these fucks are ease out they're drugging them and Tom's pretending to stab them he's just trying he's got it yeah yeah that's right Joey death everybody everybody's in on it it's not cool it's not cool he didn't deserve it right no I don't think you deserve what guy I think you asked for it but it seems like that's part of the Bert Kreischer experience right part of the Bert Kreischer experience is like people step over their dead line step on him don't you think a lot of people line step on Burke he gets very mad at to secretly mad oh yeah people just taking her shirt off with well not just that I mean just what Ari did with Tom those are two line steps big time line steps re first took all his albums and think he thought he broke him remember that's right any threaten him on it's right or Burt took of it and threatened him on Twitter that's right so Burt took the albums and then re threatened Burt cuz he wasn't going back that's right yeah I said he's gonna kill him and then Twitter suspended over they abandon and we had to show them somehow joke there was a joke I think I think management got involved I remember like there was a lot of people involved making emails and calls to Twitter trying to explain these are best friends they're comedians but when you think about like just having one of your best friends make a video of you like a deep fake getting stabbed it's like Todd did I was like yo what and it was realistic it wasn't like no it was really rough Tom's all about the Internet he knows what works you tricked him into making all the facial expressions it's so ridiculous yeah I asked bird about it and he was like you know how fucked up like my daughter saw that oh that's funny imagine seeing your dad being stabbed like that that should shaming him in the losing weight so doesn't look like it doesn't look like that anymore tit I looked at myself when my gut was hanging out my love handles are hanging out that's as heavy as I've ever been and that's one of the reasons why I decided to do this carnivore thing just try it like I'm 205 pounds I'm supposed to be like 190 I was like a legit 15 pounds overweight like okay just lose this weight so now I'm down to like I think to this morning I was 197 or something yeah oh I know not good right so I've lost 8 pounds in just just two weeks I don't know how much that's real though how much that's water how much does that reason material how much can you really show you how much can you actually lose like how much is real loss and how much of his stuff that is gonna change instantaneously the moment I changed the way I'm eating like I'm right back yeah is it from carrying around water or what is it I think most diets I noticed that like you can get it seven up to 7 pounds 8 pounds off almost immediate right by changing your diet yeah and a lot of yet like like sodium I'm just joking but that's actually a huge thing like a lot of people eat like noodles and ramen that's like your daily how much sodium you're supposed to having like 1/2 Bowl so you're just retaining a lot of water yeah and a lot of people drink Gatorade a lot and stuff like that and you know cuz they're hungover oh I get a bunch of the sodium that way and yeah there's they're a healthy form of Gatorade see someone told me that the thing that makes Gatorade really bad when you don't exercise makes it good if you do exercise someone's explaining that Gatorade like if you just want to drink Gatorade all day it's kind of like almost like sugar like you're just drinking sugar you're just drinking a soda but if you rigorously exercise Guidry is not a bad thing to have after you rigorously exercise like this is doctor who has a sort of famous workout webpage and videos and he's very very intelligent gemsto pani is his name and he actually advocates people eating candy after they work out and just to immediately replenish the muscle glycogen levels and you can do that it's one time even when you're cutting a lot of weight when you have a brutal exercise you actually can take in simple sugar very easily and it just helps your muscles sort of recover from a rate of workout so that's when Gatorade is actually good so get with the thing that makes kids fat because they don't do anything they just drink Gatorade and they just it fucks them up because it's so much sugar that's actually good for you if you just ran a marathon or good for you if you're playing rugby yeah I wonder if like the g2 s and the Powerade zeroes of how bad they are for you I mean they don't cook the same shit zero calories probably well the Z the zero calories is probably a problem those are not good for you probably as much they probably were punished electrolytes right electrolyze don't have calories but it's not just the electrolytes it's actually getting some sugar into your muscles that like that gyms - pani guy did you find him I'm looking up a thing of money tanaami bears after you workout and for carbs and oh Jim still panties interesting too because fucking fully tattooed up including his head all of his head is now but he's a very smart guy like you like if you look at him and ego I bent that guy's got his cock tattooed not that I think about your cocks are I just he's got him everywhere but he's super jacked look at him see that's what he used to look like yeah super jacked but now everything's covered including that that's his neck and everything his hands he's fucking too much though he just looks black shut up he's perfect you leave my boyfriend alone I kidding aside I go to his Instagram page all the time it's very informational very interesting videos too that he has on YouTube he's clearly a very very bright guy and is also super jacked look at that so you see his neck it goes all the way up to his chin right but it's also like the back of his head and everything too super jacked it's craziness yeah there is that's it anyway enough my boy crusher so what would turn you three o'clock man so listen you and I were talking we should commit to doing these more often yeah fun elevator especially like I'm more looking forward to like silly ones nowadays because everything's so goddam even when we're talking about things like if we talk about something seriously at least we could fuck off while we're talking about something serious like yeah and I always get messages especially after that 10-year video you guys posted people miss like I think that's just talking about
