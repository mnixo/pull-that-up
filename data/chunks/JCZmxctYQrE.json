the Joe Rogan experience is that I went from football to strongman and in football we've never done deadlifts it was all hand cleans and power cleans which by the way just quick little tip that deadlifts the fewer if you're dead lifting to be a better deadlift or fine if you're not doing that for deadlifts sake then don't fucking do it the risk to reward ratio is a joke for deadlift for dead lifts really a lot of people aren't gonna like that I'm saying that but if you go into any NFL gym in any Division one college football gym in any athletics where people are actually getting paid and it matters what they're doing they're not dead lifting we are they're hand cleaning and power cleaning why is that is the rich to reward ratio like there's it's so hard to be a great dead lifter and to not risk your low back and to be using your upper back properly and you know just there's so many little chances for you to get hurt you know hamstrings tether that was that was me my first world Strongest Man I was the only rookie in the finals bro China how much weight is that that was 880 pounds for me and my pink chucks and your I weigh less than that now I'm less of a bowling ball though yeah yeah wow that well they made those weights ridiculous looking too right well nothing that right there is something we overhead press to so they'll take some of the weights out of it and it's so flimsy when you clean it it's like basically like holding that earthquake bar that you got about that oh really it's just like that and it's it's fucking brutal let's not fight a disneyland on Instagram the other day dudes were going out on Disneyland some guy punched a check to see people filming two people were filming that these people were throwing down in front of their kids at Disneyland Oh terrible technique - everybody's terrible terrible I love that the the equally disappointing aspect of it well it's terrible to me it's the most disappointing it's like guys if you're gonna fight learn some technique yeah I mean it's like someone's stealing the stage and playing bad guitar you'd be angry with yes sir of course you I'm saying yeah I get it no I'm in complete agreement and that is kind of equally important because hey man if people are filming yeah people like a consensual fight you look like you're trying to pretend you know how to fight yeah and that the worst is the pulling off of the shirt I don't even know how that even becomes like an instinct it's actually a good move well it's to keep you slippery right so you can like well you want yeah you don't want anybody choking you to death with your own jacket oh that's true yeah that's true no okay but I mean I guess in the videos that I've seen it's been mostly about like hey check out jack yeah bro yeah yeah and here did I kind of like this dude got choked out but I couldn't quite tell what was going on here cuz he went down quick cuz that's security and he wasn't been out for a second so he's pulling that girl's hair see oh yeah he's out cold cold oh she dropped him his head banged off the ground to that ball dude choked the shit out he's like look I just killed that guy I better get out of here I think but you know every joke no charges were pressed because no one wanted to say what the fight was about hilarya was that so it was a guy that was holding a girl's hair at the end yeah yeah I said he got spit on and then he went crazy oh wow I don't know if that was the whole thing and then funny that's all it takes a little bit of water a little bit of yeah it's funny if I got all the things that make people go crazy spit in someone's face it's like wow we're ready to go to war here yeah I mean it's it is pretty good occur a biological weapon back in the day if you had some like smallpox yeah how dare you potentially infect me there was this thing with Vox where Carlos Mesa was minimizing the the impact of an Tifa and kind of joking around about it and making it seem like it's just no big deal and he got really upset cuz steven crowder was making fun of the fact that he's gay and the fact that he talks with a lisp and that Crowder mentioned that along with mocking his stance on an Tifa and then it became this gigantic thing that steven crowder is a gay basher but what didn't become a big deals that this guy is minimizing violent fascists and that's what i mean that's how i feel about this when you're trying to enforce your own ideology on other people and you have no tolerance for anybody with a differing opinion particularly journalists that is fascism it's so ironic to call yourself an anti-fascist when you're literally enforcing your own particular ideology to the point of violence and you're wearing masks and you're running around hitting people and pretending that you're being inundated with Nazis and white supremacist and that this is all necessary like that old man that was just driving and they're directing traffic and forcing him to obey them and then when he doesn't want to they chase after him and assault him it's fucking bananas and the fact that this city has not stepped in and recognized that they have a real problem because this has got momentum behind it and the people that are involved that are nonviolent you gotta speak up they've got to speak up if you're a person that really believes that there shouldn't be homophobia and there shouldn't be violence and there shouldn't be white supremacy good for you you probably got involved in this for all the right reasons but if you don't recognize that someone like you yourself who is a person of a different ethnicity you're not a white person you're Vietnamese you're a gay man you got assaulted for no reason you didn't do anything that mean it's almost like a test of where do your values truly lie and if you think it's okay for a person like you to just get assaulted for no reason you are the problem you're the problem your mindset is the problem it's not whether or not there should be white supremacy of course there shouldn't be it's not whether or not there shouldn't be people be able to freely express themselves of course there should be that is not what the issue is what the issue is is group mob mentality when you get people together and you let them wear masks and you tell them that they're fighting against some evil and then they feel justified and hitting a person like you it is really sickening and there's this diffusion of responsibility thing that happens when one person hits you and everybody feels like it's okay to hit you it's a mob mentality thing and it's it is extremely common with human beings I've got been in mob situations it's terrifying because you feel it in the air you feel the chaos in the air when you're in some sort of a large-scale brawl type situation like anything people just run up on people and start punching them it's not like two people alone in an inn like an open area where they can talk and work things out no it's chaos and there's some weird animal activity there's some weird weird animal instinct aspect to it that is very unique to humans and when you see something like this and see a guy like you just getting peppered with milkshakes and punched in the head and it's fucking disturbing and for these people to dismiss that and not stand out not stand up and say hey this is not what we're supposed to be about this is not what I signed up for they become a part of the problem I'm sure there's people listening to this that are upset at this because maybe you but you've support and Tifa you support their ideology think about what you actually support think about what this is really all about what you shouldn't be supporting is people wearing masks running around fucking hitting people you ain't changing shit with that all you're gonna do is call for more people with masks from the other side if people feel like right-wing people are being attacked and and I don't think you're even right-wing are you I mean what are what will you just would if you had a gun to your head or a mace to your face what would you we see you're a centrist what would you say I think it's fair to describe me as center right center right okay which is fine it should be okay I mean this should be we should be allowed to have disagreements of ideologies and of political persuasions political leanings but this is it's twisted and it's twisted the way it's being depicted in the media it's very strange how it's being dismissed it's very strange and that there's really people in 2019 debating whether or not it's okay to assault journalists Jorge Masvidal Maz Vidal what he said after the fight he said he would smack him if you saw him at Whole Foods yeah I think I think it's just a little too much you won I spoke I don't know their history the history is rough excuse me it's like ten years of them giving him a hard time I've been asking given miles but all according to Moz we don't a lot of talking shit which some people think is friendly Maz Vidale Street Jesus doesn't fuck around all right geez talk shit just Street Jesus he will fucking make funny you have to be flatlines here right and that's right did the flatlined him in five seconds made him the fastest ever ko in UFC history and then mocked him afterwards and said he would smack him if he saw him at Whole Foods but see we're talking about it so Maas Vidal is smart this is a yeah this is a amazing marketing ploy I mean he's he's become in one fight the most talked-about fighter in sport because he did something in the sport that's been around for a little bit that nobody's ever done before yeah Ben Askren was undefeated yeah undefeated and Maz Vidale comes out flatlines like that and talked some pretty vicious shit after the fact and even mimicked him laying on the floor yeah which would look scary the way he was out mm-hmm yeah monster doll say calls out easy Conor McGregor I want to break his face yeah that would be that's a rough fight that's a rough fight for Conor Maz Woodall was a big fellow too I mean he's he really belongs at 170 that's where he's fighting he fought at 155 but really tortured himself to make that wait all right he's a big guy you're talking about a guy who knocked out cowboy Cerrone knocked out Darren till knocked out Ben Askren mean he's knocking out big welterweights big Darren till is a big welterweight he's big he's not a guy coming up from 155 pounds he's never making Hanukkah babies 155 155 sorry yeah so he's one weight class heavier and he's really running into like the last few fights he's at least coming into his own he's really becoming something special he had a real close decision loss to wonder boy I wish I could remember how that fight went down I just think it was a decision I don't know if it was a split decision or unanimous decision but I think it was just wonder boy out pointed him I don't think there was any knockdowns right now smile zodavia's monster doll but wonder boy is a particularly difficult guy to fight and especially for three rounds and I went to Bali right after because I have some Long Island friends stayed out there for a week that's an amazing place that's a place I want to go to fly this Bali like cuz I almost went there last summer we decided to go to Thailand instead we'll have you served before no it's a it's a it's a great place for surfing no 25 to 30 feet long five thousand pounds Wow what yeah what's up it dislike jaws is real this is like jaws is real the biggest shark ever right it's gotta be what it when did this get soft someone said to me yes I remember watching on my phone you just like I said it and popped right in my head what's the biggest shark ever it's like the Shaq of human beings I've been exaggerating those numbers but that's what it says here here's the tweet what is this from Twitter someone or Twitter Martha's Vineyard Shores does exist watch how big this fucking thing is okay here comes the tail right here Martha's Vineyard isn't that where it was yeah oh my god dude it's so big oh my god Wow oh my god oh my god that is so big do you not just fuck

this Gregory long what does he do I don't look up what do you do Gregory what is this what is his actual credentials he doesn't seem like to be a shark guy but it says Wednesday wisdom how's that wisdom Craig are you talking about great guy great Craig's drunk at work that might have just been fifteen feet it might be a regular gravy the way it's fucking giant might not have been really I wonder Hawaii that the bitch monitor right they have a chip and it's called like deep blue or big blue or something something like that yeah and that's the biggest one they know of correct yeah but I thought that was significantly smaller like 20 feet bunch of websites ran the story oh but we're user Gregory long posted a video but there's no perspective though it's it's there's not a boat you can look at we can say oh this is a 15-foot boat look at it's 10 feet longer than the boat yeah come on Greg stop being drunk at work either way fuck sharks man [Applause]
