hello freak bitches I'm sure I can ice-skate incredibly man I'm fuckin again I schedule 85 yeah good first of all I can't find her shoot when I don't have my own ice Kade's so I have to write ice skates is for the same same reason why I couldn't for years I can grant those are fuckin shitty well it's not even just that my feet are too wide so if I had a regular size 11 my feet I have someone in my background fucked a monkey big fuckin big foot long time ago like when you shouldn't be able to fuck monkeys anymore someone just went back in for one more shot fuck the monkey guaranteed it was like the last like last call evolution last car and one of my ancestors just snuck back in it got one more not off but my feet are just too wide so I get in those things I'm just in agony and I just never learn how and I'm not gonna I'm not interesting enough for me to go out and buy ice skates you know if I was like this is it it's something I have to conquer then I would have to learn how to ice skate was much more exciting as a youth yeah fucking roller like not rollerblading fucking ice skating - Green Day shit like that either I mean that's right they play loud music and you spin around the ice yeah see I guess hockey would be the reason to do it like if you wanted to learn how to play hockey say you pretend you're doing hockey moves and like you're on the ice snowing when you stop and you throw the snow of people you know this right that's a cool move yeah exactly so straight you wear the hockey skates you definitely don't wear the figure skating ones mmm no chance no you don't what's the difference well they have the spikes in the front so you could do the triple toe lutz you don't worry buddy what you you don't want anybody seen your spikes definitely what you're gonna when you go straight you have to lift it a little bit and you're gonna fall on your face the hockey is a little curvature like a running shoe mmm it just allows you to maneuver to the ice so it allows you to maneuver better but it doesn't allow you to do tricks can't do you can't do a stop and then triple toe lutz or like a scott hamilton flip so are they doing flips and when they do those spins on the ice they're doing them with like special skates is that what the deal is sure Brian Boitano and I've noticed with archery my ego even when I will have me shoot the arrow in the exact same way even though I'm still off the fucking target you know like you say no no you were right their arrows right that's how the brain works like it felt right just keep doing it so so so you've got it even though the feedback from the universe like nope wrong don't take that approach to blood fucking ever stop screaming I'm doing it right Yeah right exactly but think of it man so I certainly in my life have erred by choosing my instinct over the feedback I'm getting from the universe well this is like that book that you introduced me to which I wore of art another book of five rings oh the real one and the one that talks about how you should just learn anything like good at anything it doesn't matter what the thing is that you're getting good at because if you understand how to get good at this one thing you can extrapolate from that how to get good at almost anything there's these recurring patterns that happen and so with archery it's really cool because you have to find these you have to keep all these variables the same no matter what your environment if you can learn to keep these variables the same if you're on a hill the distance in the wind whatever if you can learn how to hold these variables the same which is the anchor point the way your arm holds the bow the way you pull the arrow back the way you release the arrow there's all these pieces in there and if you can keep all of those the same or close to the same with adjustments based on whatever your target happens to be then you are going to improve in your accurate accuracy if you keep changing your variable if you keep moving your arm up or down or like releasing in a different way or whatever if any of these things are always changing you won't be as accurate over time so from that you can grab that and look at your life and realize like oh shit man my life I've just been reading all these stupid vert Abel's over and over and over again without just for at least a month attempting some rhythmic pattern some similar thing you know and when you start doing that it's really interesting because you begin to improve and a lot of and everything in general I mean there's there's arguments in anthropology that actually there were lots of societies that had a lot more leisure time than we do you know hunting gathering societies it's been you know four to five hours a day quote-unquote working hunting gathering and there lots of time for you know ceremonies and all kinds of other things it depends on where you are in the world and how harsh the conditions were but but the sort of the original leisure society may it may have predated food agriculture certainly they had no iPhones and maybe that was a blessing who knows but five hours of hunting and gathering is exhausting you know and you really don't have enough time to develop a car no no cars yeah you figured that out after you've got done your hunting and gathering then it's about cooking and but also there's no days off because you don't have any refrigeration right depending on you know depending on your climate I mean they could they could dry things and be certain yeah certain things but clearly clearly not another frigid area around the corner but you know what you're talking about about whether it's cities are just modern society that high-tech high-speed world that most of us live in where many of us don't feel like we have much free time and we're running around and doing all these things in cities usually when I talk to people who become hunters as adults by and large that's part of why they did it they wanted to reconnect yeah you know it's part of why they garden it's part of why they raise chickens it's part of why they do all sorts of other things that you understand and value to they want to get back in touch with those not only the hands-on skills but just the world they inhabit you know beyond the domesticated concretize city concretize you know you know good word you know the pavement you know but on the pavement yeah into nature but it's a little garden patch in your backyard or you know hunting around the Missouri Breaks you know there's a sense of wanting to reconnect so that all these practices hunting gardening raising chickens in part are like an antidote to modern life so you want to you want me to tell you a bit about the evolutionary roots of religion how you would study religion as an evolutionist okay you ready yeah so one argument is based on it's an adaptive argument right so the idea is if religion exists does it confer an adaptive advantage to people and so there is some work done by a good friend of mine David Sloan Wilson an evolutionary biologist where he argues using a group selection as argument that that groups that are religious outsurvive groups that are not by virtue of them being more communal more cohesive more banded so that argument is an adaptive argument for why religion exists there is another argument by other evolutionists that is based on an exaptation argument have you ever heard that sir exactly exactly know what I mean so that's a byproduct of evolution in other words it's something that evolved not because itself it confers an adaptive advantage but rather it's piggybacking so for example the fact that your skeletal system is the color that it is that itself is not adaptive it is a byproduct of other evolutionary processes so from that perspective religion piggybacks on computational systems and our brains that evolved for other things before I mean for example coalitional thinking the idea of viewing the world as us versus them blue team versus red team that is an innate part of our psychology Mouse now religion piggybacks on that right it takes that computational system that already exists in us and it it puts it on steroid right so do you think about the Abrahamic religions right every one of them has us versus them they are the Jews the Gentiles the believers the Kufa right and so agency detection detecting agency in things is something that is innate to us religion plays on that the agent becomes God and so that's an argument that was proposed by Pascal whyyyy where he's basically saying that religion did not specifically evolve because itself it is adaptive but it's piggybacks on other things that have evolved and then a third way to study religion is to just do a content analysis of the the narratives within religion so there's a great study done by a Darwinian historian where she looked at in the Old Testament how many women are ascribed to a different male in the Old Testament as a function of his status so the higher the status of the male the more sexual partners he had which is exactly what you would predict from an evolutionary perspective high status to men confers reproductive success so there are different ways that evolutions and there are several other ways that can study religion from an evolutionary perspective [Music]
