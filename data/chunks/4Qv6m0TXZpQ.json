hello freak bitches now you but you've also been real open about steroids which i think is very commendable because it's one of those things in the world of powerlifting the world of bodybuilding and even in the world of fighting it's a dirty dark secret that people like to keep to themselves but your grandpa can take it yeah yeah right yeah I believe in my in my opinion there should be used to pass the physical no one has the right to tell you what to do in this world one when it comes time to die I'm the one that's got to die so much time for me to live let me leave the life I want to live but what do you think in terms of that the problem with a lot of people have the problem the problem they see with using steroids and sports is going to force young people to use steroids to be able to compete with the people that are using them and good anyhow yeah but if everybody's forced to be clean then they don't like what we're doing now with the UFC you wear like the you sada the the people that have stepped in Jeff Novitzky running that program the guy who caught Lance Armstrong well actually Lance Armstrong was never caught right right he passed 25 tests for seven years in a row whenever was tested see it's not against the rules to take drugs it's against the rules to get caught taking drugs um that's a fucking loophole you've got a good doctor you're on the crap and I'm not so that's why there should be no deal of Tyson Fury said make it an even playing field stop the drug test I'd say the same thing and we're not all born with same out testosterone that's true I mean when I was a kid I even was if I was born today I would be in prison you're not telling me teach like all these you know some of those fighters they've got way more testosterone did another fight that's true not born same amount so the only thing you could buy not party on train you got a better if you got a better you know you could kick my ass because you do jujitsu shit and I don't do any but I don't mean you're tough on me I just mean you had a better coaching me so are you cheating me that's a good point but if two guys do have the same coaches and they do have similar body types and one guys taking steroids he's going to have it right but isn't that pharmaceutical what are you look at you watch TV every five minutes you got a drug commercial one right every if I be 69 let's take all the guy I'm 68 I'll be 600 let's take all the health medication off 68 year old I'll be the only one left owner I don't have any element Khan will tell you my problem is to go to doctor just notice that moment there's nothing wrong with me I just beat the crap out myself physically III don't have high blood pressure and cholesterol I don't have anything and so let's just take all the drugs away but all the old 68 year old guys die off is community well a video only one went for garlic all the old women yeah but for a guy like you who's not competing and see one of the arguments for fighting is that steroids allow you to do more damage to your opponent and that that is one of the reasons why steroids should be illegal it's because you can train harder you have more endurance and not just steroids but things like EPO and yeah let's other stuff you'll have more energy in a fight you could possibly land more blows possibly wind up beating someone you wouldn't be able to beat and do damage to them so it's different a lot of ways but why why wouldn't person take his force for him you know it's called peds performance-enhancing drugs right why wouldn't you do that in sports well it's because they would think of it as cheating well who does well a lot of people how many guys have cry their eyes out but to get caught then they cried like bitches and they'll I run baseball players they only never took drugs you get caught in a cry like pitches right that's what I don't like just tell the you know I tell people but I see them billboards on the freeway says I shall not lie just quit lying and come out and say I take droids you know the NFL why would you be in a sport like E in FL you know what drugs do is for recovery right that's all it is right you know you take I can give my strongest people I've ever seen dude I've seen weak guys take more drugs than anyone I've ever budget really yeah drugs don't make you strong you're born that way you're born fast you're born slow you're born with an attitude no you're not well that's the big misconception about steroids right is that they make you bigger the work makes you bigger it's the recovery right cause you did you recover to do more workouts right so everyone doesn't want to do workouts how do people you know save you wanna be a MMA fighter until they get in a cage one time right never get but Coleman told me Mark said he had a million wrestlers when he had hammering house here so they got are barred one time he never came back right yeah yeah but there's there's a mild benefit to taking testosterone a bunch of other stuff without doing any physical work but almost all of it is in the fact that you could put in more work and you recover far quicker than the average person yeah but see that way if everyone took it you're not cheating you know you know you got it you got a you got a Corvette you don't have to put high test cats in all right but don't you think that like it also but for young guys who can fuck up your endocrine system and fucks up your body's production testosterone at what so what so what that's what HCG is for you got a smart doctor you take a see everybody takes HCG because your knuckle shrink up because if you take roids you take tests you're taking more than mother nature told you so you're not shrink up well they're morons anyhow because you took AC cheaper than us what drink up HCG what is that's the advantage of a hormone it raises all your hormones winners in sports there you cannot there's no the sportsmanship in sports it mean you were to fight in front of a big crowd half the crowd would want me to knock you out and the other half a crowd would want you to knock me out as that's fortune shit well that's just people I mean but but that sportsmanship is supposed to be the athletes competing without cheating I mean if I if if there was a pill that you could take that made you invulnerable gave you like a god pill and you took and you went into a fight and the other guy thought he was fighting a man but you're you're invulnerable no one can hurt you you can't be hurt you don't get tired what generally have superhuman strength that's a good point which sure would still be legal till they go to point well it would be better than steroids it would be like a super steroid but I mean wouldn't you think that that would be cheating No no no but well then nobody can beat anybody the fuck out of each other nothing would ever happen happening hell's right here it all starts up in your brain man see I kind of could see how you can make that argument with other sports but fighting I mean fighting is about but fighting is problem-solving with dire physical consequences I mean that's what it is and if you can minimize those consequences through drugs a lot of people would think that would be cheating I look at like this I look at the Diaz brothers I'm guessing they got a lot of testosterone I don't know who the hell their dad was but he must have a lot of cancer well it's interesting those guys eat vegan and for the most part thing Nate eats fish and eggs too I don't even know if Nick eats fish they might have in the past but I don't think he does anymore I think he's pretty much vegan which most people that eat vegan have lower testosterone because the substrate for developing testosterone is fats is like cholesterol and fats are one of the most important it's it's like when people get on ketogenic diets one of the more interesting things that happens when they consume a large amount of fats and saturated fats and cholesterol is that their testosterone goes way up as you went that your own high cholesterol diet yes so I don't I don't necessarily know if those guys have high testosterone what they do have is high endurance their endurance is through the roof right but a lot of that's because they participate in triathlons a lot of endurance running endurance swimming biking things along those lines so it's you still have to have a brain thought to go kick someone's ass right but doctor you think of Ronda Rousey has that brain thought to she was having a testosterone well mean she has some but not a lot yeah I mean but more than the other girls yeah but not without my fine work well that's a little different well see that's the argument for steroids right there that's the argument because she actually has been caught she's actually tested positive and obvious she's passing tests now right yes but you know as well as I do that when a woman takes male hormones for a long period of time even if they get off of them there's benefits that they keep forever it's the same thing with men yes just because you're passing truck tests I won't say who I trained the top international shopper he could golf Hannah barn eight days and pass a drug test IOC shit IOC see that's it's it's only eight days you don't own an apartment above the quickest ones to get off up for ya so I mean in that you I mean how I forget to take stuff for eight days so the benefits unquestionably are permanent or at least some of them are what I think about you know what you're looking at you're looking at a fighters career as you see it in an envelope and then when I did that tough hire retires you forget about but what about the years later after a fighters career if he was on antibiotics he would survive the fighting years and be able to continue his older years like me so what you're saying is that listening well longevity post career I totally understand that a lot of fighters believe that as well like testosterone replacement growth hormone therapy for guys who have retired but while they're competing themselves they don't want to do anything because they don't want to think that the reason why they accomplished those goals because they were taking drugs I can shoot tons of roids and sometimes I think will make them kick my ass it's not gonna make them kick their ass but there's no question that some fighters fight better when they're taking steroids well how about only not just a nutritionist let's just cut out their nutritionist yeah but the nutritionists look look everybody knows how to eat healthy I mean if you're eating healthy and you're training hard but one guys taking steroids and one guy's not there's a giant advantage for the guy who's taking steroids I just don't too many people take steroids and then you pass a drug test that's all I'm trying to say right well that's make up any names I understand and I know you not but that's one of the reasons why the UFC is instituted this incredibly invasive you saw the policy where they don't wake you up at 6:30 in the morning well how do you like that watching piss in a cup I don't like it exactly but that's the only way to catch people I just I mean I'll never go with the drug test I don't think the NFL chef's drug test I don't think any entry I think this is a good argument there you know first of all it's a good argument for baseball baseball no one's getting hurt in the NFL you can make the argument you're able to hurt guys more and then that damages them and it shortens their career but but baseball there's no argument my opinion baseball is boring it's fuck mind if I mean some people like it I get it but what I'm saying is like if you if you got a drug that lets you hit more balls over the fence take that does the only thing interesting about baseball's homerun is ego-self wha blood that's is so how do you let that sport get away with it you know what I'm saying why not make it legal for all you know like baseball is a funny thing you know if you hit less than 50 home runs against your drug free but you start hit 51 you're on roids right it seems like that's what this quote they talk about the base of the steroid here mm-hmm we're taking drugs in 1960 so who they drawn the kids were they yeah as st. Louis you know as a football team you know the Raiders I've heard stories where I think it's even documented on ESPN that we're going and had people tabs on the training table all right well you know what I just say to the Raiders what the baseball team that the oral the ace the Athletics but what it's like if they're in the same town youth it's like assign these to ensure having sex with one of the girls room section both degrees what if no one tested their new football players were taking it right it okay in Oakland but why wasn't why wouldn't the baseball players be taking it right down the street yeah they probably would what do you think the people were thinking of steroids as being like like that kind of power being a crucial aspect of baseball bad thing what it was sure today smells more of a skill game don't you think did one ever test Mickey Mantle Roger Maris Hank Aaron you think Hank Aaron was doing steroids they had steroids back done bad shirts 1939 but where people were athletes taking them know exactly yes that's what I'm trying to say okay the football team was taking it why wouldn't the people so we got these fortune answers all geeks anyhow there goddamn thing in her life right but they're all so hypocritical and they got these ideas and their puppy on they're probably taken uh you know I'm testosterone 238 is peeing I said apparently one time this doctors are big fat guy he's talking about how bad boys are so I'm just listen to them and then my friend says what's a patch one here is all it's a testosterone patch what kind of thinking is that I mention is a dirty jittery story well there's a lot of hypocritical thinking when it comes to that stuff for sure it's just it's it's an interesting debate and a lot of people think that you should be able to do whatever you want like the pride days they're in the pride days which in my opinion was some of the most exciting all-time mixed martial arts fights those guys did whatever the fuck they wanted and the Japanese literally told them like in their contract we will not test you for steroids they told them that you know like a horse racing yeah right dog racing yeah but everybody that's okay so you just worry about that well equipoise right equipoise is ecwid it's like got a horse in the fucking title okay yeah I mean and that's something that people take and it's a hormone for steroids for for horses exactly now so you don't think there's anything negative without this obviously got to be some drawbacks to steroids right I went on anabolic in 1910 uary 1970 1970 1970 and so was this 2016 yeah I've never been off you never been off in 46 years that's insane you just stay on them that's right no side when I go off um to tell everybody you're awesome I got exact I go out there tell the truth I don't lie do people get upset on you that you're so honest about it I don't give a damn of the upset but but I'm just curious and you'll never have my back to counsel self-respecting uncle about these geeks they're not doing crap right they suck when they were kids they suck when you're middle-aged they suck when you're old ah that's how I look at it our day in prison I'll be on roids a whole country about rody wouldn't be putting our world would be in the shape us in the day if they had some nuts but if they had not stayed with me steroids right cuz in the night let's say some aggression right some aggression yeah so my premise is psychologist and he would test people in prisons rapist and murders he said he attested some had twenty five times the rate testosterone normal man doesn't twenty five what times that's why I say you know it was it even possible well got the boy why are they out there raping people might be killing people wouldn't knoe no remorse because he got enormous mountain he said that he's sold that's why he probably did it he didn't you know if you can't do that stuff he realized that but he thought that's why they would be on a course to do stuff like that it is absolutely crazy you take look at elephants you dug these elephants I what they call it one night it just ease out ten thousand turn out killing each other and knock down villagers and everything so the world needs more of that well I think it needs more because of the cat look at uh you know what when I was a kid just ten percent gay now they say there's thirty four thirty four percent more person he fucks as that but colleges good I believe it there's no way you need boy bands okay there's no way is thirty four percent get four percent oh man okay well I'm sure someone got cast off here because look at Jeffrey Dahmer he's out there killing people mm-hmm well he was gay too yeah that's what yeah but I don't think I don't necessarily think that's a testosterone thing right that's a sociopaths Psychopaths thing no don't say that well I don't think well I'm not talking about the gay part and the other part or eating people yeah yes I mean that but that's but that's not a good argument for testosterone if you're saying that prisoners and rapists and murderers you have a lot of it so everybody's got a lot of opinions about roids but I've seen probably a thousand people on roids over the years right okay no maybe more right that's right the ones who took the most drugs we're not always the strongest and I think the strong guys didn't much and a lot of them and then I mean your lesser guys ticket on a ship but he just can't in essence it's not what strong well isn't there also a point of diminishing returns where like taking too much of it throws your body out of balance to the point where he's not going to recover correctly because your body is constantly dealing with this end and it makes you crazy right you can't concentrate yeah that's a that's a real problem that people don't want to admit that road rage isn't a real thing I've seen it it's real it's 100% real I don't think there's such thing you don't think so well you said it makes you crazy yeah but I don't seem that little amudha guys you know there's plenty of fighters would fight a 300-pound guy cuz it's just crazy because I see right you know it's not because they're on roids are fucking crazy right but when people are taking too much steroids and it makes you crazy a little guys not going to jump on a big guy and get his ass great you know because a roid rage he'll do it because he's he was born that way to do it your mourners to kind of people praying predator you'll find out which one you are real quick [Music]
