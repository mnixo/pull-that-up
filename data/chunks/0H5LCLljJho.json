logan experience joy my day Joe Rogan podcast by night and we're live gentlemen here we go again what's happening back in the room a pleasure to see you guys as always this is one of my favorite podcasts that we ever do and this is very timely because first of all the big New York Times article about the possibility of a comet hitting Los Angeles the preparations for what they would do if a comet hit Los Angeles and the comet known as Donald Trump that's hit the United States and he's even got the hair it's just the whole things I mean if the end of the world was coming boy it's all on the wall you know the writings all there it's kind of crazy mm-hmm so what's the latest and the greatest well the latest and the latest and the greatest is like I mean last year when we sat down with you I think it was last November mmm yeah it was almost a year got floated in the discussion the idea that this really important comet research that's going on which is just changing our whole view of history and prehistory and of the future of humanity but it would be good to make a film about this and crowdfunded I actually mentioned that to the scientists and they said what we really need is more funding for our research and so they've inspired by basically by your show they have put out a crowdfunding campaign which is linked on my on my website it's the comet research group and it's it's a big story right now so how can people find it really quickly it's IndieGoGo well now that research much quick away just go just go to my website Oh Graham Hancock calm and there's a revolving banner which is the comet research group click on that and you're in this beautiful ok Graham Hancock calm and then crowd funding for comet research and so what are they were trying to put together well they're they're wanting to see the thing is these guys have actually not had any official funding this is a group of major highly credentialed scientists who for the last decade have been investigating the extraordinary story of a massive comet series of comet impacts on the North American ice cap twelve thousand eight hundred years ago that is the the global Cataclysm that wipes out a whole civilization from from prehistory so that's why it's of interest to me they're not coming at it from that point of view they're coming at it from rediscovering something that we've lost about ourselves something is really important to understand the role of cataclysms in the story of the earth and they need to do much more research they need to go back to Greenland and look for the nano diamonds in the in the Greenland ice cores they need there's a there's an ancient city which they're not revealing the name of which they're pretty certain was wiped out by a comet impact about four and a half thousand years ago they want to go there and investigate that so there's a lot of fieldwork they need to do to drive home this hypothesis and to frankly put down the opposition because there's been so much opposition to this idea from people with vested interest in other theories that that's why these guys have not got funding so the only place they're going to get funding to do this further research is from members of the general public and that's what we're hoping that will will happen it's called the comet research group there's a banner on my site and all the links are there to their crowdfunding to their website which is full of masses of scientific information and to their Facebook page as well it is a very unusual thing the the fact that we know that comets and all sorts of various large objects have impacted the earth we see the craters we know they exist but it's so rarely discussed it's so it's so strange if it wasn't for this article in the New York Times I can't remember one the last time and that it even came up and it's such a huge issue it's a massive issue it's a massive issue both Randall and I have really you know given a great deal of thought to there's nothing rattled you that the point is that catastrophes are the untold story of our past we were given a little we're givers a little hint of it February of 2013 Chelyabinsk siberia reverie of it yeah yeah now that was just a little cosmic spec came in I was about fifty feet in diameter which is about um and it came in at a fairly low angle it blew up nearly eighteen get that thing right in front you right in front of me like this yeah if you flat it out it's usually easier how's this just better yeah all right there we go so it came in I think it exploded twelve miles about 20 kilometers up in the atmosphere but it still enough to damage thousands of buildings and injure 1500 people another thing about that one is if it had been slightly larger if it had come in at a slightly steeper angle a little bit higher velocity you could have had thousands of fatalities rather than just injuries and that would have been major headline news at that point as it was it's already forgotten but you do remember yes oh yeah oversee we may even talk I've talked I believe indeed we did I think most videos of it you know it's fascinating is Russia has so many of those trail cam and nut trail cam um dash cam photo cameras that's right because they have so much insurance fraud apparently over there slam into each other all the time and they want to record it so we're fortunate enough to have so many of those videos because of that which puts it on the record whereas other otherwise it would it would not be I think I think people don't they don't like to talk about cataclysms and catastrophes and actually nor do I nobody wants a horrible Cataclysm to occur but this is the point which is that the prospect of a comet or asteroid Cataclysm on the earth is actually much higher than has been told to us up till now and something can be done about it it doesn't have to be the end of the world we don't have to you know say okay it's all over forget about it quite the contrary this is this is just something that would be prudent and rational for the human species to do and amongst many other imprudent and irrational things that we focus on instead we should be focusing on a bit on this well at least just to heighten awareness of it and and also the possibility that we've been nailed a bunch of times and we've forgotten about it and this is this is the big thing that you've been dealing with your entire career this skepticism about past civilizations I mean I got into it with Michael Shermer who's a friend of mine who's a very famous skeptic I got into him with it yesterday because I posted that you were going to be on and he started chirping something about civilizations 12,000 years ago where's the evidence on like to do you don't even you're saying this and you don't even know about gobekli tepe so I sent him gobekli tepe and literally like five hours later he wrote something claiming that while that was made by hunter-gatherers it was all just really to sort of suit he narrative so he doesn't know that no one knows nobody knows that they're so determined to keep the existing model and and when new evidence comes in which can't be explained by the existing model they just try to explain away the new evidence and not not think maybe it's time to change our theory you know this is this is the unfortunate thing but cataclysms a global Cataclysm the massive event that happened twelve thousand eight hundred years ago the Younger Dryas impacts which were a series of comet impacts on the north american ice cap this accounts for why we don't have a lot of evidence hard evidence over 12,000 plus year old civilization because it went down in that catastrophe it was wiped out I've been trying to amass the evidence actually that complements what Graham is doing and it really answers that question the Schirmer brought up and it's a legitimate question where where's the evidence but I'm quite sure the Schirmer is not really educated in the extreme events that have really taken place on this planet in the last ten to twenty thousand years um and what that would do to any kind of evidence it maybe while we have some time here today I've brought a few things to try to convey some sense of how extreme some of these changes have been and how one would actually be quite shocked to find anything existing in the aftermath of these events well Michael Shermer is a brilliant guy and I don't mean the shit on him but but what what is disturbing to me is that his knee-jerk reaction to this without having any research at all in the subject not knowing at all about gobekli tepe which was discovered in what the 90s yeah 96 I mean so this is to me this is something that I've looked at because of you guys in great depth when I read your book I was just completely enthralled with this idea of history having some sort of or rise and fall and civilization having these resets so I've been absorbed in it for a long time but what's fascinating to me is people that consider themselves to be skeptical or you know or I mean he's a skeptic professional insurer but many people who question anything that's outside of what they've been told as soon as they hear any sort of a theory outside of what they were told they immediately call quackery happy anything and this but it's it's a weird knee-jerk reaction to something especially when you talk about asteroids that is very real part of our past we have a ton of evidence I mean there's actual craters that you can look at on earth the moon which has no atmosphere is littered with them and if we look at the moon as a model for what could possibly have happened to earth or at least you know some of them obviously with the moon having no atmosphere it's going to get hit a lot more than we are sure but still I mean this is a very real situation that this this solar system you know at least as far as we know the only solar system has to deal with this but we know this is a real issue maybe we've seen impacts what it's like you just said on the one hand you have earth scientists looking at the earth and what they're realizing is that the earth is pockmarked with scars and each of these scars represents a tremendously powerful catastrophe that's happened in the history of the earth now that's accepted by mainstream science that that major catastrophes have happened in the history of the earth but where this thing now is about to come full circle is the recognition that these kinds of catastrophes have also influenced the rise and fall of civilization and a lot more a lot more extremely than then has been recognized up to this point and while geologists and earth scientists are looking at the surface of the earth and realizing that itched into the surface of the earth or imprinted into the surface of the earth are hundreds of scars of which undoubtedly are only a small percentage of the total that exist at the same time astronomers are looking out into near-earth space and discovering that we cohabit space with a lot of stuff it's not as empty as we thought just within the last six or seven weeks we've had two close flybys of previously undiscovered that really of previously undiscovered asteroids this the point is NASA keeps saying well is you know there's we've counted 1,650 asteroids and none of them are going to hit the earth in the next hundred years well yeah that's true but what about all the ones they haven't counted which are estimated to run into hundreds of thousands and which haven't been seen yet and what happens is we see them roughly ten days before they pass the earth that is not enough time to do anything about them but we have time if we're prepared to be rational and reasonable as a civilization to take care of this issue now when you're dealing with hundreds of thousands of near-earth objects that are flying around like what what are the things that could be done to protect Earth you can paint it's it's low-tech actually you can paint one side of the asteroid affect its albedo so that the sun's rays push differentially on one side rather than the other that will shift its orbit slightly it has to be calculated you can give it a little knock with with with a rocket basically you don't want to blow it up you don't want to turn you know you're one big piece of our artillery shell into buckshot you don't want to do that you want to you want to move it into a safer orbit you can mount jets on it people are looking now to mining asteroids of course our society always goes our civilization always goes for the where weather where the money's to be made but yeah if we can mine asteroids we can move asteroids and and the technology is there and ironically the most dangerous asteroids are going to be the ones that are the closest to the earth which are the most accessible and the asteroids pretty much have unbelievable amounts of resources on them I mean pretty much everything that is being mined on the earth can be found in asteroids from the hydrocarbons to precious metals to all of these things and we're not that far away from technologically being able to actually you know mount expeditions to asteroids and mined them and that's that's the the you know that's the solution I kind of prefer because again these things are tremendous sources of reefs of all kinds of things that would be usable to an expanding civilization and we could feasibly within a decade or two be mining asteroids and again the ones that are the easiest to access are also going to be the ones that are more dangerous because they're the ones that are coming the closest to the earth so and another point here is that there is one specific danger there's one specific if you like region of the sky that really needs to be looked at and this is this is the region of the sky this is why I wrote magicians of the gods because because of this discovery that there's a thing called the torrid meteor stream which is 30 million kilometres wide and which envelops the solar system and the earth on its orbit around the Sun passes through the torrid meteor stream twice a year turns out the torrid meteor stream is the debris of a giant comet that came in to the inner solar system about 20,000 years ago that thing was at least a hundred kilometers in diameter according to their calculations it may have been more so and then like other comets like shoemaker-levy 9 which spectacularly hit Jupiter in 1994 it began to break up into multiple fragments and those carry on orbiting on the original path which and as they break up more and more they degrade and small bits and large bits break off and it gradually fills up a kind of huge hoop of debris that the earth is passing through twice a year it takes us 12 days to pass through it we do two and a half million kilometres a day on our orbital path 12 days to get through the torrid meteor stream and the scientists of the comet research group have made the point that a big object out of the torrid meteor stream multiple objects as a matter of fact was what hit the North American ice cap twelve thousand eight hundred years ago it looks like there was a second series of impacts eleven thousand six hundred years ago from the same source it looks like there were other impacts in the Bronze Age the most recent almost definite impact out of the torrid meteor stream was Tunguska in Siberia back in 1908 that hit on the 30th of June 1908 and that's at the peak of the torrid June shower when we passed through the tories in June and and in November and what they're saying is we really need to focus on this torrid meteor stream their calculations are that there are hundreds and hundreds of massive objects in that torrid meteor stream and you know as a comet breaks up into bits it becomes those bits become asteroids and those asteroids are circling in the torrid media stream and I've likened it to strapping on a a blindfold and crossing an eight-lane interstate twice a year and just hoping that we don't hit any heavy traffic you know that we meet bicycles or motorcycles rather than rather than trucks but the trucks are out there and what the comet research group scientists are saying is we need now to be in depth investigating the torrid meteor stream because it appears to be the hidden hand in human civilization it has wiped out episodes of our history in the past and there's no reason to expect that it won't do so again unless we do something about it because the remnants of that original giant comet still circling in the torrid media stream and they are fucking dangerous now how is this being received in mainstream science I mean is there any resistance to this because it seems like this is all pretty straightforward and entrer scible mostly being ignored mostly being ignored why I think that is by scientists who have a vested interest in other ideas first of all there's a vested interest in not admitting that cataclysms are important at all this goes right back to really to the 19th century when science began to take shape in the form that we know it now and they wanted to separate themselves off understandably from superstition so I didn't want anything to do with something that sounds like the Biblical Flood for example they felt they would be contaminated by that and they preferred to explain any cataclysmic evidence as a result of gradual processes so you really think it's because of the reluctance to accept religion or religious ideas or to to separate themselves I think that was the stuff where it started or it started to separate themselves off from that now they've gone a long way from that and many many scientists have got a vested interest in what is called uniformitarianism or gradualism and they they don't like to hear about cataclysms having any major impact on the story of life on earth so is it sort of the momentum of these initial desires to escape religious influence that have sort of led them down this path yes and then there are others who have a vested interest in current accounts of global warming there's others who have a vested interest in extinctions taking place now they want to say that our ancestors were responsible for the extinction of all the mammoths and mastodons and so on and so forth whereas the comet research group scientists are saying no those huge megafauna of North America were wiped out as a result of the massive series of impacts on the North American ice cap I'm reading a book right now by Dan Flores a really interesting book called coyote America he's a wildlife historian and he is really an expert on all the different forms of Wildlife in North America where they originated were they migrated to and one of the more fascinating things about it is he's talking about all these animals that went extinct you know ten thousand plus years ago this mass extinction event and never once does he bring up cataclysms and and there's all these different these different ideas and one of the big being that human beings with addle addle x' which is like really a very weird sort of a spear throwing device wiped out the woolly mammoths and all these other animals and to me a posture it's a lunatic idea also if you have any contact with hunter-gatherers today you find that hunter-gatherer peoples don't over kill their game they they hunt them respectfully they take what they need and they leave the rest because it's a renewable resource for them so I don't think hunter-gatherers wiped out the the mammoths in North America the evidence is compelling it was the comedy well the evidence that you brought up when you were here the first time when you showed the images of all those mammoths that had been literally knocked over with broken legs from the impact of something on a mass burial grounds like these mass did you know and not burial grounds obviously but mass casualties mortality sights mortality sites cool yeah that's a good way of putting it yeah in fact graham i visited one up in south dakota called hot springs where there's just several dozen nobody knows how many are actually there but there's at least several dozen two species woolly mammoths and Colombian mammoths that have been entombed and while we were there I interestingly I you know the the guide the woman giving us the tour there was kind of giving the a gradualist explanation at well over long periods of time these mammoths wandered into a sinkhole and were too dumb to get out and so they became entombed and I asked the question well what studies have been done on the the sedimentary matrix in which their remains are being found because as I'm looking at this sedimentary matrix I'm seeing a massive deposit that in other words a deposit that was instantaneous instantaneous and when I brought that up she actually got very irritated and wailing you all yet dismissed my question didn't you know what we've got it all worked out you know we we know about that well what is it well you just we've got it all worked out and it immediately went on with her like but yet I had an article that was actually written by one of the original scientists worked on the site and he his description was well it could have been that but also as an alternative and he used the term bloat and flow that what you had was woolly mammoths that had been caught in a flood drowned and they're bloated carcasses floated into a depression in the landscape and that's where they were entombed and that makes a whole lot more sense to me than the fact that you know individually over several thousand years these in these mammoths wandered into this sinkhole and then couldn't get out but you got to bear in mind we're talking about you know at the end of the last ice age a hundred and twenty roughly species of megafauna that disappeared which is about equivalent to the same number of megafauna species that inhabits the earth today well as a short period of time was something like 65 percent of the North American mammals went extinct 75 / 75 percent a very short period of time or a very short period of time pretty much totally coincident with that period called the Younger Dryas and so there's nothing resembling what we're capable of doing today back then I mean when you look at human extinction events human caused extinction events was very logical and what we're doing today with pollution and the expanse of civilization and weapons are super sophisticated if we wanted to we could wipe out a lot of different species yeah but what we're out of the least the case actually seeing is that at the end of what's called the balling allarod which was the gradual warming at the end of the last ice age that preceded the sudden catastrophic change at 12,800 was a de Clovis culture that existed for three to five hundred years I think yes somewhere but they suddenly were gone right exactly simultaneous with the mammoths and then there are interesting studies that coming out now showing that at least continental wide there was apparently a major human population crash exactly coincident with the megafauna extinctions because you had quarries that had been mined for centuries that are suddenly abandoned you have campsites that had been that had generations of debris and toolkits accumulating and so on debris from the from the the fluting of the the spear points and so on that are suddenly abandoned right so the evidence actually suggests that the human population crashed which would certainly imply that they would been far less capable of wiping out all of these species of MegaFon also the the studies of their diet and their life ways suggest that they were very quite diverse they were hunter-gatherers and they focus mostly on small game they ate a lot of fish lot of shellfish they gathered food and why would they go after the biggest most dangerous animal you know in the in the whole in the whole array of animals and with the incredible efficiency hunt them to extinction in a hundred years it doesn't make sense no it makes no sense it seems pretty silly it mean ancestors from that time if I may say Randall mentioned the Clovis culture this is for a very long time really until just a couple of years ago all of the mainstream academics in the fields of archeology and anthropology were saying there were no human beings in North America before let's say 13,000 years ago give or take five hundred years and they came across the Bering Land Bridge the Bering Strait at that time was above water sea level was lower they entered the Americas then they weren't hit there before now in the last two to three years there's just been a whole raft of new scientific research and no scientist today is prepared to defend the Clovis model anymore it's accepted of course that they've been human beings in America for 50,000 60,000 years and there's weird genetic links like for example there's a trace that connects Aboriginal Australians with North Americans they had a common ancestor it's a very peculiar thing that's going on and so what what happens is that actually these scientific models which constrain and restrict research for so long do get overthrown and that Clovis model is being overthrown and what the missing piece of the puzzle puzzle I think for everybody working this field is the Cataclysm the comet what happened between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago which changed everything is it the bizarre to you guys or frustrating in any way that this is not a mainstream idea this is this very much fringe but yet it's it's not something that we don't have any evidence whenever whenever I put out a book I'm I immediately there's this huge hostile reaction like the Michael Shermer thing like the Michael Shermer thing like me I mean I would say magicians of the gods which I published in 2015 which deals with this whole comet issue is actually the most thoroughly documented the most thoroughly referenced book that I've ever written it's calm its measured they actually don't read it they just say Oh Hancock's brought out another book he's a pseudo-scientists that's what they always call me or a pseudo archaeologist and and it's obviously rubbish because it disagrees with everything that we know well that's the point of the heretic in society is to offer an alternative view and and well-documented evidence but it seems that we're dealing with such a deeply ingrained mindset which is connected in curious ways to power structures in our society that it's very difficult to change it absolutely like graham mentioned earlier there's kind of a poet it went from a religious motive I think in the 19th century and now it's more a political motive and again the idea that every day you'll find something you know coming from various factions that were destroying the earth and the earth has never suffered this kind of you know assault on it before and and you know we're causing the sixth great mass extinction and we're going to cause catastrophic global warming if we pump another 50 or 100 parts per million of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and and so what that is done is like many I won't say many but several of the scientists now that have been in the forefront of criticising the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis are also very much involved in the global warming movement and the idea that we are now precipitating the sixth great mass extinction having looked now at mass extinctions and been really an obsession of mine for about thirty years now I've looked at everything from the cretaceous-tertiary the Permian Triassic you know right on down the line to the most recent one which to me is really in some ways the most interesting because the most recent mass extinction that we're talking about is the one that took place while we humans were were part of the of the story and between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago the Younger Dryas yes the Younger Dryas which is still an unexplained climate anomaly that happened and I mentioned this I think in previous broadcast that you know what you had was you had just spasm of extreme warming followed by rapid shifting into extreme cold literally within a matter of a few years and we're talking about climate changes that are up to 15 degrees Fahrenheit within perhaps 1 to 5 years which uh turley Dwarfs anything that we've experienced in the last since the industrial revolution began and we still don't really understand and that's why this research is so important because now we understand that there was something cosmic that happened it's left its imprint in the landscape over what four continents five continents yeah over over 50 million square kilometers of the Earth's surface there's a giant debris field of the this stuff that is only produced by massive impacts these things come in at 70,000 miles an hour and you know if they have any diameter at all if they're if they're 100 meters or more in diameter they are they are going to hit the earth really hard they're not going to burn up in the atmosphere and when they do they pack a huge amount of kinetic energy a huge amount of heat and shock and that creates very definite chemical products so nano diamonds so Carbon spherules so melt glass that's like the Trinitite that was produced in nuclear explosions all of these when they're all found together in the same layer of soil and when you can put a date on that layer of soil and when it's all over the world there's only one thing can explain them a massive cosmic it I don't understand why this is controversial I really don't I mean I do I understand it because I know that once people start teaching things once people start doing lectures and giving speeches they want to stick to their guns and they want to they want to somehow or another avoid anything that's going to contradict what what they've been espousing it's a game this is a game changer this information it changes everything it changes the way we've looked at our past it changes the whole story of archaeology and it changes the way we're going to look at the future and I think that people in academia are reluctant to embrace that change and they're afraid of being called pseudo scientists because there's a whole lobby of skeptics who use this word pseudo scientist or pseudo archeologist as an instant dismissal of other ideas and those who are in the profession they don't want to get tarred with that brush they want to keep themselves clean and I understand that but you're talking about hard evidence yeah you're talking about this nuclear glass you're talking about nano diamonds you're talking about core samples that show this massive shift when you do the ice core samples massive shift in temperature and you're talking about very clear evidence of impacts that we know exist it's not like a comet's a theory that's not like it's Bigfoot or something like you know we're looking for the final piece of evidence it shows that comas real thing exactly it's real it's Toth it's totally real but it's so difficult for those who are invested in other models to accept and unfortunately they have the ear of the media it's the it's there are or by the way all the scientists in the comic comet research group are absolutely mainstream scientists and they have taken a lot of flack from their colleagues for even daring to investigate this area that's why they've had no funding they've had to fund themselves it's so well that is so crazy because this is not a controversial thing in my mind shouldn't be it should not be this is not an airy-fairy thing we're not talking about psychics we're not talking about UFOs we're talking about something we know exists yeah so to bury your head in the sand over something like this seems to me invested in a process is interest right now NASA is spending the equivalent of one attack helicopter a year on investigating the the Comet and asteroid danger you know 50 million dollars a year that's not that much it's peanuts it's a tiny it's a miniscule some hundreds of billions of dollars on on massive sophisticated military equipment which we can use to slaughter one another in ever more sophisticated ways but just fifty million dollars a year on saving the earth from from a potential Cataclysm that could put our civilization back into the Stone Age tomorrow and I don't mean to keep harping on Michael Shermer because I like microwave but that he highlights this sort of natural inclination to poke fun at something that he has done no research on whatsoever when I pointed out gobekli tepe and I sent him some articles from National Geographic he went radio silent mm-hmm I mean he should know about it it's astonishing the people mocking it yeah he's gonna mock it you should actually know what you're mocking and to say that Gobekli Tepe was created by hunter-gatherers what I'm sorry that's just theory that's not it that's not a fact you seem very very sophisticated site with astronomical alignments with hundreds and hundreds of megalithic pillars weighing up to 20 tons each the world's first perfectly aligned north-south building which you can only do with astronomy this is it's not enough to say oh they were just hunter-gatherers there was something strong from a half a mile away I mean there's there's some serious sophistication I mean what how big were these stones well the the biggest one actually still in the quarry they left it because it had a fault in it they clearly intended to move it 50 tons you're looking at 20 foot high objects and then it's the it's the putting together of them see here's the problem hunter-gatherer societies are not the kinds of societies that produce large-scale fixed monuments why because they don't generate a surplus you can't pay for somebody to become an architect and for it of those times somebody become an astronomer you're busy hunting and gathering and that's what you do agriculture generates a surplus and that's the bat is the problem at gobekli tepe because there is no background this site just appears out of nowhere amidst what appears to be a hunter gatherer community but what they're not considering is the possibility we're looking at a technology transfer that the survivors of a lost civilization who already had all that knowledge came to go back Lee Tepe and use that site as a center of initiation to teach the local hunter-gatherers how to do agriculture and that's now taken as the beginnings of civilization I would say it is the reinvention or the remaking of civilization so when we're looking back at Sumer and any artifacts we find ancient Mesopotamia in that area Iraq those are the people that are sort of reinventing and relearning well that's hence Oliver actually when we talk of Mesopotamia which means between two rivers the Tigris and the Euphrates gobekli tepe is sitting right there in the headwaters between the Tigris and the Euphrates and we cannot separate that from the later cultures that enter history five thousand six thousand years ago they're part of the lineage that descended from gobekli tepe times and what's fascinating about gobekli tepe is the way it doesn't fit the way there is no background to it that you would expect to see them practicing learning architectural skills the oldest stuff should be the worst and as they carry on it gets better that site ran for a thousand years the best stuff is the oldest a thousand years later what they were producing wasn't so good this is a real anomaly and it needs to be investigated not mocked by skeptics but actually explored to consider maybe this does Rock the whole paradigm and it's kind of ironic that in their desire to get away from the ancient myths and tales in the Bible they've ignored those ancient myths and tales which all talk about cataclysms well part of our modern psychology is to imagine that we are somehow so far advanced from our predecessors that we now represent the pinnacle of civilization and anything that preceded us has to be looked upon almost as you know as if the workings of children it requires a major psychological shift to admit or accept that our ancestors have may have been far far more sophisticated than than we had imagined in our 19th century models which basically still dominate thinking today and you know in Graham's book he devotes several chapters to the story of one 19th 20th century heretic J Harlen Bretz in his story to me kind of encapsulates the whole the whole process of forcing his paradigm shift and for years he was out there exploring this evidence that there had been this tremendous flooding in Washington State and all of his critics were dismissive without ever even going out and looking at the evidence firsthand in the field but what he did was he stuck to his guns for three decades and continued to amass evidence to the point where they just couldn't they couldn't dismiss it anymore and finally a group of them went out and began to explore the the landscapes for themselves and one of the leaders I think you talked about it in your book James Gillooly who was sort of the leader of the the skeptic faction that had set out their sole purpose was to discredit and lay this whole flood heresy to rest once and for all but he went out in the field and they spent about eight days in the field where he's seeing this evidence for himself over and over again and when you look at just one piece of it you might be able to say okay there's other explanations for that but what happens is when you get multiple lines of evidence all converging and there's no way to individually explain away each one of those things other than just saying oh well it's all coincidence what he this James Gillooly was honest enough so that after a week out there they were in a place called Palouse Falls in southern Washington which was one of these areas where these tremendous inland tsunami swept across the land and I actually just visited there about eight weeks ago when I took a group of people out there and and took them to Palouse Falls to show them right on the spot where James Gillooly was standing when he finally had his epiphany divyam images that that you brought with us I have images I can dig them up here yeah I sure do yeah I've got some really interesting images to show you which relates because see this flooding stuff relates directly to the idea of the impact and we can get into a little bit of that explaining how how these parallel lines of evidence are now converging but the interesting thing about but Gillooly was that in the India descriptions of the trip he wandered off by himself for a long time away from the group and was standing here looking at this massive cataract with 400 foot cliffs in this little tiny ribbon of water flowing over it in this huge canyon below it and these big boulders and he had seen for a whole week he'd been seeing this stuff and it finally got to the point where it wasn't undeniable and he walked back to the group and the words out of his mouth verbatim were how could I have been so wrong and he finally admitted and at that that was like a turning point and now and again Graham describes it's very effectively in the book how in a way the flooding phenomena was hijacked and then placed within this more gradual istic context to really to avoid the fact that it was something so anomalous in so such a departure from our modern experience that we had to look outside of our modern experience to find an explanation what they wanted to do was find something within our modern experience and this is the the cornerstone of the uniformitarian approach is that we look for a modern example and then we extrapolate backwards from that and so what they did was they saw well in the modern term in the modern world we have Pro glacial lakes lake that's that form in front of glaciers and sometimes these Progreso Lakes might be held in by a ice dam or another glacier these ice dams will give away and they will cause pretty catastrophic flooding they're very common up in Iceland because you've got several volcanoes under the law the Icelandic ice sheets and up there they use the term yokel ops to describe these outburst floods but here's the thing when you look at the modern versions of it you basically are looking at floods that are less than one thousandth of one single flow from these floods we're talking about that happened you know twelve and thirteen thousand years ago one thousand less than a thousand less than a thousandth in peak discharge and in total volume and and so it has been admitted in several places I've extracted the quote saying well we do admit that this is a major extrapolation upwards but never mind yeah you know was it never mind is so disturbing me see Holland breaths for 30 years was walking the walk in the channeled scablands and what he saw was evidence for as he called it a humungous flood which which actually Rosenthal within fell within three weeks and and he went through decades of being put aside by his colleagues insulted they mocked him they laughed at him just as the sceptics do today but gradually the evidence began to mount and they couldn't deny it any more that there had been there had been flooding and actually eventually they gave Harlen Bretz Joe Holland Brett's the Penrose medal which is the ultimate you know the ultimate be stole of geology in America he got the accolade and he said at that he was aboard more than 90 years old at that time and he said at that time he said all my enemies are dead so I have no one left to gloat over but but the point is in a way there was nothing to gloat about because what they did was they they they separated him from his central idea instead of accepting that there had been one huge flood and that was always his view they said oh there must have been 70 or 80 floods that caused all this damage and that's what we're that's what we are seriously challenging right now it's so ironic in a way that the human desire for knowledge is what has led us to where we are today we have this insatiable desire for knowledge and for innovation but that same human desire to achieve is also what what's the the ego is responsible for that and the ego blocks anything that's contrary to what you've already established as fact exactly as soon as you see something that might throw a monkey wrench into the gears of what you've been teaching and practicing your whole life and I know that you've gone through this with Egypt your your whole issue with the Sphinx and with dr. Schaack and John Anthony West was on the podcast I was with you just recently yeah he's amazing by the way I'm going to be doing an event in New York with John Anthony West when on the 29th of November where it's well it's in it again it's linked on my website the details are on the talks and events pages in its in some church somewhere but I'm going to give a presentation and then I'm going to interview John live on live on stage first time I've ever done that I'm kind of podcasting you know in such a character he's an amazing I love that dude and in magical Egypt is I think one of most important things anybody could ever watch I think that DVD series is just insane it's so spectacular and so fantastic and next to going to Egypt with that which I haven't done I think that's probably the second best thing just bet you back and John is an example of why we need heretics this is this is the thing you see that the science today yes you're right we have this thirst for knowledge and its case human characteristic but also we get invested in particular positions that when people criticize those positions we take it as an existential threat and where we beget all angry and hot and bothered about it if we allow that to happen too much we don't keep a place for heretics in our society then we're never going to do anything novel we're gradually going to get locked down ossified into the into the existing system we need heretics John has been the leading heretic on ancient Egypt for decades pointing out that we should listen to what the ancient Egyptians said that their civilization was not a divot it was a legacy it was a legacy from the time of the gods and that cast me back again to this whole issue of a lost civilization now when gobekli tepe was discovered it vindicated you in so many ways but what are the possibilities if any of more of these sites being explored and exposed Amu's are there are there more that people are looking at right now are there any that are under the radar just a year ago at the bottom of the Sicily channel at a depth of more than a hundred and twenty feet it's been underwater for at least 9,000 years is a huge megalithic site before the discovery of Gobekli Tepe that site could never have been explained the dating is absolutely definite the Seas rose and covered it at least 9,000 years ago we don't know how long it stood there before it was covered by the rising seas but there it sits underwater and I think underwater discoveries are and I've had a part to play in this over the years are one of the ways forward we need to look at those areas because there was a 400 foot rise in sea level at the end of the Ice Age you're looking at the amount of land that would be put together in say Europe and China added together that amount of land was swallowed by those rising seas and archaeology has largely proceeded without taking account of those lost lands I'm not saying they haven't looked at all but they're primarily in marine archaeology interested in shipwrecks now this this megalithic site is there images of this so we could look at there are yeah yeah yeah I can I can probably find it monolith at the bottom of the Sicily channel try that try that a search on that pull that up Jamie yeah but so what does this look like is this and is this been clearly established that this actually is the work of man this is not some sort of a yardang or something of course there's dispute right of course but the mainstream is not going to just accept this overnight but again it's mainstream scientists have found it they're absolutely certain that they're dealing with a man-made site there are holes drilled through these megaliths one of them is very very large there's a series of other megaliths around about it's not a natural thing so here we're looking at some of it right yeah so there's that big big megalith broken into two parts right there oh wow yeah and and and this we can say a often with archaeological sites the problem is dating them you know for example there are incredible megalithic temples all over the island of Malta not far away from this place incredible megalithic temples but they can't date the stone directly they have to date organic material associated with the stone and that can give them misleadingly young dates in a case of a site that's been covered by sea level rise there can be no argument nobody went down there and built that 9,000 years ago it had to be built before the Seas rose and that puts a minimum age on it of 9,000 years what are the best images that we can look at because right now I'm just seeing rocks it's very difficult because I'm looking at so that's I mentioned I'm afraid that's all you're going to see those are those are the best images of it that existed over 1 right above that that's in Yonaguni okay that's not in that's not in the Sicily channel so um what what are the biggest pieces down there is it this right here is this way yeah that big thing big thing there I'm 30 feet long I think and is it what what leads you to believe that this is man-made the scientists who worked on it the fact that there are holes drilled through the stone the fact that you can go to neighbouring areas like Armenia and find really very ancient megalithic sites where they have exactly the same kind of holes drilled through the stones and the holes seem to have been used for astronomical sightings now this sites a mess it's been knocked over by the sea it's fallen down but we're seeing the same thing big megaliths with holes drilled through them and you're also dealing with 9,000 plus years of erosion and barnacle arose all of it all of that and the ocean is a difficult place to work you know yeah it's it's it's not easy visibility can be bad you're dealing with currents there's all kinds of all kinds of problems this is Britain just cups Cameron this crazy little submarine ring in James Cameron well I spent seven years scuba diving or around the world looking at this stuff and you know it's pretty convincing in my view well it is it does make sense that if we do know for a fact and we do that the sea level rose dramatically at the end of the Ice Age it makes sense that some things would be buried under the water well in during the Ice Age whatever you know you don't have to talk about advanced civilizations or anything but the during the Ice Age living on the coastlines in establishing your as communities everything on the coastlines would have been probably one of the most benign places to get you know because for one thing you're down near see the sea level this presence of the Seas is going to you know smooth out the climate and so forth so you know you're going to have probably most cultural development during the Ice Age is going to be close to this to the sea so it's going to be underwater now just like Graham was talking about and so this to me is probably the future of archaeology as marine archaeology where a lot of discoveries are going to be made and in that particular thing I mean there's a lot of megalithic structures around the world that if you set that thing up like this and put those citing holes through it would look precisely like scrape the barnacles off of it you know and no one's saying oh it's proven but what it is is we have to keep an open mind and say well there are some very strong similarities here so let's investigate this thing further and that's the whole point of all this is all of this stuff needs more research it doesn't need some Cavalier dismissal by somebody who's you know protecting their their own paradigm it needs more research on all fronts I mean because I think that there's enough evidence it is now accumulated to suggest that there is a deep history to the human species on earth and we're just beginning to really appreciate how much deeper really is than the conventional models of history and rather than just waving an arm and dismissing this with a skeptical snare with a skeptical sneer exactly oh it's interesting is there's accepted scientific models of humanity when you're talking about supervolcano's right like the super volcano of 60 70 thousand years ago towba yeah I mean they're they pretty much accept that wiped out of the vast majority of human beings on earth mm-hmm and why is the supervolcano hypothesis so easily accepted but yet the asteroid impact both of them are real events both of them are historically documented in fact we really don't we've never watched a supervolcano take over the world but we've seen asteroids hit other planets we've actually watched shoemaker-levy like you were talking about before we call embodying Jupiter unbel lievable bigger impact and the planet Earth itself yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly so yeah and actually more than 20 impacts each each each one of them would have wiped out all life on Earth if that if that object had hit the earth yeah so you know so it's a it's a it's very another thing too we were talking about underwater structures but let's also consider the possibility and again john anthony west work is important here let's also consider the possibility that we have misidentified a number of structures that are standing in plain view like the great sphinx Egyptology read any egypt logical text any encyclopedia actually they will tell you that thing was put there by a specific Pharaoh Pharaoh Khafre of the fourth dynasty round about 2500 BC that is not a fact that is an opinion but it's presented as a fact there is not a single inscription that relates the Sphinx to that fair or not a contemporary experience Krypton not one dating from 2500 BC in fact there's nothing at all it's just the assumption because it's close to a pyramid which they assume the same pharaoh built again on the absence of evidence that the sphinx must have been built by them but john anthony worse was the first to see that actually when we look at the sphinx we're looking at a highly eroded stone object and that erosion is very odd and that's why he brought professor Robert Schoch professor of geology from Boston University to Giza in 1992 to look at the Sphinx and say what actually caused this weathering on the Sphinx and shock immediately saw it what caused it was exposure to a very long period of heavy heavy heavy rainfall and no such rains have fallen in Egypt in the last five thousand years but they did fall during the Younger Dryas we had a prolonged rain out from this comet impact as that ice cap was pulverized and a massive amount of ice water was thrown up into the upper atmosphere prolonged rain ow which could have been the cause of the erosion on the Sphinx now what has occurred new what discoveries have been discovered in the last year like what what is new that we can look at there in terms of archaeology there's not much new gobekli tepe at the moment is in deep freeze it's right 30 miles from the Syrian border there's been massive an unrest and unrest in Chandelure which is that the main town archeology is very difficult for them to to carry on there it's basically just frozen where it just sort of stopped they've just kind of stopped you know and in fact there's amazing number of these of these sites another site I visited from magicians of the girls was bar back in the Lebanon absolutely stunning site and again I'm convinced that that site is nuanced it is yes there is a Roman temple there but they put that temple there because the site was sacred long before and there's this incredible u-shaped megalithic wall which surrounds Baalbek which does not appear to have any connection to the to the Roman structure at all again that's an area which is subject to tremendous unrest and difficulty and it's difficult for archaeologists to proceed but just just in 2014 they they made a huge new discovery at Baalbek of a buried block which weighs one thousand four hundred and sixty tons which was sitting there on the site that they'd been working that site for a hundred years they only found it in 2014 Wow 1000 tonnes 1462 is that two million pounds so that is like I don't know it may be what math is better than mine and converting it into pole one times 2,000 pounds yeah 2,000 pounds to her to a turn to an imperial ton so whatever and I had three zeros on it double it and had 3 zeros on it it's a horrendous amount of pounds to put that way this it's a single largest block of stone ever cut and quarried in the ancient world and they found this just in 2014 found it in 2014 now there's another big one right beside it which has been in plain view for about the last hundred years and it's astonishing to me that this one which is just below it was covered by sediment that we have a national calculator you might be the only person unless I never go anywhere without my calculator uh-huh nobody has one of those we were just talking about that yesterday you're like who the fuck assistant is an actual car I'm the last guy take care of you when it while the so Baalbek was also the site of I mean there's many mountain monoliths that have been discovered there and it's really fascinating site that most any people have sort of overlooked when you talk about ancient structures absolutely I have to resist I I've got nothing against aliens but I don't need aliens to explain these things I I think a much a much leaner and more elegant explanation for these huge archaeological anomalies is a lost human civilization much better it has been the case that I've been making for 25 years I think the the alien thing is a bit of a distraction but of course there's aliens of course the universe is full of life but the ancient archaeological sites are not good evidence for that idea that they're very unless you massage the evidence a lot they're not good evidence I think we are dealing with a lost human civilization and at Baalbek 20 feet above the ground we have three blocks of stone join so closely together that you can't get it edge of a sheet of paper between them each one weighs more than 900 tons and they are 20 feet above the ground it's a stun it's a stunning achievement it's just absolutely astonishing how on earth did they do and how does mainstream archaeology deal with that they say are the Romans built it all are the Romans yeah the Romans did it the Romans did do some awesome stuff they did do some awesome stuff they absolutely did but this site is separate from the Roman site it surrounds it but it's not part of it in my view in terms of your question what's happened within the last year or two I would think that probably the most significant thing or certainly right up there would be the the comet research and the discovery I mean like this article I have right here which came out in 2014 so it's not that old a nano diamond-rich layer across three continents consistent with major cosmic impact at twelve thousand eight hundred years ago and it's something like 2425 highly pedigreed scientists and these are the comet research group gives scientists from the comet research group who have funded all their research themselves they came out with another paper in 2050 where was this published if anybody wants to read this that's in the Journal of geology yeah but then there's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences hosts a lot of their work as well and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences get into trouble for hosting their work but they feel it's important so they keep on hosting it this is so spectacularly confusing to me because that's rocks science yeah this is evidence it actually can weigh this stuff you can measure it you can you could run tests on it and find out what its components are this to me is so baffling yeah it's very baffling they had brought out another paper in 2015 I won't go into the some of the details are boring but it's called a Basie and chronological analysis and basically what they're what they were looking at is it they asked themselves is it possible that this evidence these nano diamonds these melt glass the Carbon spherules could that have been laid down gradually and the chronological analysis that they've done absolutely answers that no it was not laid down gradually this whole thing unfolded in a period of about 24 hours whoa what a night yeah in what had happened Joe was that for years archaeologists had recognized this up Ede black matte layer at about two dozen or more of the Clovis sites around North America which there had been over 50 of them that have been studied and it was C Vance Haines who wrote an interesting paper saying that he was the one who noted that below this black matte layer which is only two to three inches thick in most sites you found evidence of the Clovis culture you found their toolkits and their their spear points and so on you found evidence of the extinct megafauna but not above it you would find this evidence of this cultural activity and the megafauna right up to the bottom of the of the black mat layer but not above it so what finally happened was in 2007 Richard Firestone and Alan West and some of their colleagues and it was just basically a small group at that point took a look at this closer look and that's when they began to discover these impact proxies usually right at the base of the layer and the layer itself is carbonaceous which suggests that there had been a lot of soot deposited which would imply widespread wildfires factors to study off the red off the coast of California on the Santa Rosa Islands that pretty much concluded that there was just massive wildfires that pretty much just annihilated everything and then this was preceded by the deposition of this black matte layer and right at the bottom of this black matte layer is where you'll find the nano diamonds the magnetic grains the microspheres the carbonaceous Ferrell's fullerenes you find these impact proxies and they're not all the same at all the sites in fact that's been one of the things that the critics have seized upon but what they're doing is I think taking an oversimplified model and when you look at a comet fragmentation event you could be looking at the individual pieces could be have very different compositions and what we were talking about earlier the torrid meteor stream I'm not convinced at this point it was necessarily just a single impact event it may have been a bombardment episode that may have lasted even several decades it may have then ceased for a while and we were talking about this last night over dinner that there seems to be a second spasm at eleven thousand six hundred years ago that's also associated with a massive rise in sea level they call there's two meltwater spikes meltwater spike one a in meltwater spike one B I'm quite convinced that these meltwater spikes that have been documented by marine geologist and oceanographers are correlated with these melting events of the ice sheet that I've been looking at in terms of their their geomorphic consequences because some of these events I mean the only way I can describe some of these meltwater events is that you the only modern analog to this would be a tsunami and we've seen some pretty devastating tsunamis within the last decade or two both in Indonesia and in Japan and I don't know if you've ever seen any of like the videos of these tsunamis anybody listening it is definitely worthwhile to go online and look at some of these videos where you can actually see the the unbelievably powerful effects of a 30 or 40 or 50 foot tsunami right now some of the landscapes and I have a some images we can pull up here shortly are places in Montana Idaho Washington where you literally had a tsunami sweeping over the land there was over a thousand feet deep and that tsunami came off the I'm not an oceanic tsunami that's like it's a freshwater tsunami it's meltwater coming off this this catastrophic melting of the ice sheet and I've traced the sources of some of these meltwater I've made two trips now up into the into the plateau country of British Columbia looking for the source of this meltwater because in the conventional models now of this this flooding this that goes back to Harland breaths and basically what they've done is they said initially there could have been no flood because Harlen Bretz didn't provide a source for the water they said the critic said well you're saying that all of this evidence in the landscape is evidence of the flood but what was the source of the flood and he didn't have a source so the critics then said well you don't have a source for the flood water therefore the flood didn't take place then as as the research evolved you had independent evidence accumulating in western Montana by JT Pardee who was with the US Geological Survey and he was investigating evidence that the mountain valleys of western Montana had been filled up with an enormous volume of water and this volume of water seemed to be exactly the same time as brett's as floods he then assumed that this was a giant lake and because you can see and we can I think we have some images I think Jamie has some images so we'll pull him up shortly we're on the mountain side you see the shorelines itched you know a thousand feet above the valley floor and what he then decided was that based upon an old nineteenth-century interpretation by TC Chamberland that there had been an ice dam he said well there must have been an ice dam west of here somewhere in the Clark Fork Valley a giant lake backed up burst through the ice dam and then this is what would have caused Harlen Bretz 'as floods so now the geological community is shifting because number one the evidence is overwhelming and they can't deny it anymore but what they're doing is looking for a gradualist or a more uniformitarian explanation so they immediately latched on to this well there's a giant Pro glacial or in front of a glacial lake in western Montana well you're talking about somewhere between five hundred and twenty and five hundred and fifty cubic miles of water that's a lot of water right in in and normally when you have a large lake you have a huge catchment base and it is feeding lots of streams and rivers that are feeding into that lake when you look at the any of the big lakes around North America you have the lake and then you have this big old catchment basin and all of that's feeding in Lake Missoula the whole lake fills almost the whole catchment basin it's like to me what they did was they said okay we're just going to push the source of the water from here over to here but let's not go into the question of where did the water come from that's filling these mountain valleys of western Montana and this is what I spent a couple of weeks in September going up into some of these following these valleys up into British Columbia and there's spectacular evidence and it's almost like the American geologist stopped at the 49th parallel and they say well that's the Canadians preserve up there we'll let them they've got their own theories we've got ours interestingly the Canadians are saying that we think that the water for these floods came from up here but they don't like that because you see one of the leading geologists who was saying that these floods came from from Canada is John Shaw who who basically came up there was idea that drumlins which are these inverted boat hull shaped landforms that are found by hundreds of thousands in regions where where glaciers were that they were formed not by the glaciers grinding over the landscape but they were actually formed by massive sub glacial flows of water and his critics have all been saying well here's the problem what's the source of your water therefore it wasn't water wasn't sub glacial floods is easy parallels the Harlen Bretz a story very closely well here's the thing Shaw and his colleagues couldn't really come up with a plausible explanation for how you could form these massive sub glacial reservoirs in fact what they call the Livingstone Lake event required eighty four thousand cubic kilometers of water and I eighty-four thousand kilometers I can do it really quickly here we divide that by 36 that's about 2300 cubic miles of water that's more than all of the great lakes combined vastly bigger than all of the Great Lakes combined it's probably every Lake in North America combined and he said this one event required over two thousand cubic miles of water well where did that water come from so he basically said well there must have been a reservoir somehow that formed his critics have said that's impossible you couldn't form that much water under the ice sheet well what's happened now is the idea of a major cosmic impact into the ice sheet has completely obviated the need for a sub glacial reservoir because now we have a way of instantaneously melting enormous volumes of ice it's no longer a mystery when the water came from fully explained and this has been the missing piece of the puzzle until the comet research group began to identify this evidence well it's baffling to me that this is a source of controversy because we know that the Great Lakes were created by melting glaciers we also know that there's vast areas of North America that are flattened by these glaciers you know a buddy mine my friend Doug lives in Cazenovia Wisconsin which is what's called the Driftless area where the glaciers didn't go through I just was there in May it's peuta a it's beautiful it's gorgeous give rolling hills and it's just it wasn't it wasn't crushed flat like other parts of North America were right so we know we know that those glaciers melted and they created the Great Lakes I mean the Great Lakes were from glaciers we know that that's an established fact so why is all this confusing I just don't understand why they wouldn't just add that to it they just can accept the great glaciers somehow or another in the last 10,000 years the glaciers just decided to stop smashing North America flat and melt and create these great inland oceans of fresh water yeah yeah those are it's it's very bizarre ultimately a lot of ideology is is involved in this there's there's that there's this desire also in the modern world there's a desire not to panic the public not to say things that are that are going to cause that are going to cause panic you now with Donald Trump being president I think people ready now I think people are ready for panic I think so has anybody debated you on this either one of you on this well you know I tried to Dan but not specifically on this I tried to do a debate with Zahi Hawass who was the guy who runs the Giza pyramids and the madman yeah yeah total total I mean very crazy event there's a video of it online there's a video video of it online the debate last what 30 second is something like something like that yeah yeah yeah and then and then later on when he when he finally agreed to come back into the room because he was so angry with me walked out when he finally came back into the room he was asked a question about gobekli tepe and just like you're skeptic he didn't know anything about gobekli tepe or he claimed not to know about I mean this is that this is supposed to be the world's most famous archaeologist and he knew nothing about this incredible site in a weenie in a neighboring country but one point to make the Randall was talking about the second event eleven thousand six hundred years ago we're dealing with an with with an episode of Cataclysm begins twelve thousand eight hundred years ago and ends eleven thousand six hundred years ago both episodes accompanied by massive floods and the eleven thousand six hundred years ago date I may have mentioned this last year it's in it's in magicians of the gods what's interesting about that is that is the exact date that Plato gives us for the destruction of the lost civilization of Atlantis Plato that's the only source we have for Atlantis it comes to us many people think it's all over the place but it's not Atlantis comes to us from the Greek philosopher Plato who lived around 340 BC and he got the story from through his family line from his ancestor Solon who had visited Egypt in 600 BC and there Solon was told of a great civilization that had existed on earth that was the progenitor civilization of Egypt but that was destroyed in a terrible Cataclysm and he asked are there Cataclysm involving a gigantic flood and Atlantis was submerged beneath the waves and was never seen again and so Solon said to the priests when did this happen and they said three to nine thousand years ago that was in 600 BC so that's 9600 BC that's eleven thousand six hundred years ago that's melt water pulse 1b how could they know yeah how could we have to start taking this stuff more seriously instead of sneering at it and skepta sizing it out of existence we need to leave a little bit of room for extraordinary ideas possibly being right that's the main beef I have with the skeptics is that they want to throw the baby out with the bathwater I want to add something to that in the Timaeus you know Plato discusses Atlantis in two dialogues and in two Timaeus he preface 'as the story of Atlantis by recounting the myth of Phaeton now the myth of Phaeton is a very interesting story and basically what it is as Phaeton was the offspring of hey Leo's the Sun God who was raised didn't know who his father was his mother kept it a secret from him and then one day he was being taunted at school because all of his schoolmates had you know recounting the great deeds of their fathers and everything so he went home distraught and finally his mother said well actually your father is the the big granddaddy of them all Helios the Sun God so Phaeton decides he's going to go and find his father and eventually does and he goes to some you know celestial realm or his father is located and the way it is with the with it with the Greek gods they have unlimited powers except they also have certain restrictions for example if a God makes a promise he or she cannot go back on it right so when hey Leo sees Phaeton has his lost son come he's overjoyed he says I'm so happy to see you I will grant you any boon you want and Phaeton says i want to drive the chariot to the Sun I want to drive your chariot and hey Leo says well I meant anything you wanted except that you know so it goes back and forth and back and forth finally fate and convinces his father let him let me do it his father says look you've got to hang onto those reins tight because those steeds are going to pull away from you he gets in there the gates of the Sun open it describes in the myth you can go you know you can read Edith Hamilton or Bulfinch or any of the great retellings of the Greek myths and they'll describe it in there it goes through the signs of the zodiac and then all of a sudden it careens off and heads down to earth and then it describes this whole litany of catastrophe setting the earth on fire and finally the Jupiter at the the the beseeching of Poseidon who is afraid that the oceans are going to boil away get Zeus to mount his his Mount Olympus and hurl his Thunderbolt which knocks Phaeton from the sky and he falls to earth and falls into the river air adonis which is a metaphor for the Milky Way and his sisters the hell yachties then weep over the death of their brother and their tears fall to earth and cause the great flood Plato then after referencing that myth he then says now this has the form of a myth but what it really represents is a declination or a declining of the bodies in space orbiting around the earth in an eventual falling to earth of one of those bodies and a conflagration of all things triggered by the fall of that body it's intriguing that he mentions the zodiac because because the torrid meteor stream is so cold because it appears to come at us from the direction of the constellation of Taurus the zodiacal constellation that's where those shooting stars amongst which are some very large objects that that have hit us in the past and can hit us again in the future that's where they come from they come from that area of the sky it's an actually an illusion it appears that they're not actually coming from Taurus it looks like that they come from that area of the sky they come from that area of the sky and so anybody in in ancient times who was witnessing and according to the Victor Clube and William Napier and those guys who are the British neo catastrophists that have been doing all of this work for decades on the toward meteor shower have concluded that you know in times past it was an extremely active shower and would have created some pretty darn impressive light shows even if it wasn't causing catastrophes down here below but what they've what they've conjectured is that there might be times of multiple Tunguska like impact bombardment when you know there could because there could be thousands of objects within the tarde meteor stream on the same scale as the Tunguska object and that if if you go and you read the accounts the eyewitness accounts over and over and people are saying things like well it looked like it was being discouraged from the Sun it looked like it was being born out of the Sun right it looked like a second Sun in the sky like for a short period of time the Sun had a twin right well the summertime torrents are coming from their parody lien passage around the Sun so you like grain was saying they make an elliptical orbit out to Jupiter and back around the Sun in this stream right earth crosses that stream twice each year one time late June early July we cross but at that point they're coming from the direction of the Sun so their their arrival to earth is going to be very difficult to see because they're coming from the direction of the Sun right but that's exactly where on June 30th a torrid meteor would be coming from and then also the fact that it's that the perfect date for the peak of the of the shower and the correct place in the sky to me is pretty convincing evidence that it was most likely a remnant of that torrid stream the other time that the earth crosses is late October early November in fact we've just passed out of it within the last week basically but it Peaks interestingly coincidentally between like October 30th and November 4th or 5th so it's peaking right around Halloween time in fact they've been called the Halloween meteors and there's some very intense I work sometimes thing called the Halloween fireworks yeah but there's some very interesting work done by a researcher back around the early 20th century named grant Halliburton who spent about 15 years researching the connections between ancient calendars and he concluded one thing very interesting was that a lot of these ancient calendars were being synchronized by people's observations of the rise and fall of the Pleiades which is the shoulder of the bull the Pleiades comprises basically part of that constellations like Taurus yeah yeah the shoulder of the bull and what he came up with was that in his research he discovered that many of these stories that were associated with us like the slaying of the celestial bull you know Gilgamesh and Enkidu in the in the earliest known story they they fight the celestial boulders many counterparts and variants of that in mythical stories and so what he then found out though was that in many cases the that our modern Halloween actually goes back thousands of years to an ancient day of the Dead that was observed all over the earth at the same time every year even in the southern hemisphere and it usually revolved around a commemoration of the the culmination of the Pleiades which is when the Pleiades crosses the local Meridian in other words it reaches the keystone of the Royal Arch so to speak up in the sky so if you go out on Halloween now and you face the south in the northern hemisphere you will see the Pleiades right at midnight at midnight they will be if you think of the the arch of the zodiac as being a like a clock it's right there at midnight at midnight right well here's the interesting link is that in all of these myths what halliburton discovered over and over again was that the Day of the Dead ultimately went back to myths about of the destruction of the world by a great flood and/or fire it's fascinating that it's all coming out of the constellation Taurus - and it's the celestial bull that they're fighting in these ancient myths and then all these cultures around the worlds are celebrating the day of the dead of this exact same time this amazing stuff and right now our science is closing its eyes to this I I think it's fair to say with the torrid meteor stream which is a very big issue in this whole discussion that we are dealing with a hidden hand in human history it's something that is going to ultimately require us to re-explain almost everything that the skeptics hate it they can't bear it because first of all it involves cataclysms and secondly it involves the possibility of losing a whole civilization from the record it's really it's really interesting when you look at the dates of the this cluster this episode of bombardment between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago that's the period that just immediately precedes what mainstream academia think of as the very beginnings of civilization and they've just never maybe if not even their fault it's this is so recent this science is so new that they've not had time to adapt to it but if they adapt to it and take this into account then suddenly what was an extraordinary and absurd an impossible idea that there was a lost civilization twelve thousand years ago becomes a very plausible and reasonable idea and then we start once we can once we take that on board then we can start opening our eyes to archaeological anomalies like the Great Sphinx like Baalbek like submerged ruins like gobekli tepe and begin to consider what does all this mean are we in fact a species with amnesia are we here forgetful of the truth about ourselves maybe that's why we're so fucked up you know because we just actually don't know we've made up a story about where we came from what we are I certainly think it plays a part and I also think that conservative skepticism is probably prudent when you're dealing with most scientific issues most things that come up that people are claiming I mean there's so many charlatans out there crazy people that are claiming new discoveries but uh in some cases they examine these discoveries as long as they're far enough away from us or weird enough like this new planet that they believe they're they have a 90 planet sign in yeah yeah they they're pretty sure there's something outside past the Kuiper belt and they think it's massive they think it's at least four times maybe larger than the United States or then excuse me the world down the world and got an orbit of about ten thousand years yeah and that's interesting with comets because this huge massive object circulating in the outer solar system through the Kuiper belt which is the source of many of the comets that hit the earth is destabilizing comets from safe orbits and putting them into really dangerous orbits they come our way the correctly from wrong but like what what is the source of all these near-earth objects do is this have anything to do with earth one and earth two does it have anything to do with the initial impact that created the moon is that because we were hit by another planet right during the formation of the earth and this is all scientifically established Astro scientists or astrophysicists rather and astronomers all agree on that right there's a lot of debris would go back to that to that time and but comets are another story because they're coming in from the far reaches of outer space they're coming they're coming in from the Oort cloud and the coital just vast distances away they're their voyagers they're kind of messages from the distant reaches of the cosmos who come in in an unpredictable way because their orbits are destabilized by something like Planet nine isn't there something called bodes law where you you can measure the mass and the orbit of a certain planet and you can accurately depict where the next planet is going to be and doesn't that fall apart somewhere between Mars and Jupiter that's with the asteroid belt yeah yeah yeah which would indicate that something was probably there what in the theory of the asteroid belt that it was an exploded planet of course there's a lot of opposition to that theory too you know you're right skepticism really has an important role to play it's it's very it's really it's really essential that we are skeptical otherwise we'd all be following on zecharia sitchin for the Anunnaki to land exactly it would have sold our houses December 21st 2012 we'd all be going with the fuck now I'm homeless example years later I have to say there's a skeptic called Michael Heizer who has done really an excellent job of thoroughly you know debunking the bogus translations of zecharia sitchin is wrong coms hitch in his wrong doctor it's a very useful it's a very useful site so we hated him and loved him at the same time is so sad I love the idea of the aliens come down and manipulating the monkeys and making us to mine gold it's a wonderful story but unfortunately it's a work of science fiction it's not a work of fact yeah we need I knew him he was a fascinating man I once drove him from Stonehenge to London we had we had many conversations he was a deep and serious researcher but I think he I think he got he got carried away with his own fence I also think that that fantasy became very lucrative and it also became a source of identity to him yeah you know I followed him pretty closely as well I've read the 12th planet and I got really India's research and this is in my early pot-smoking days when I first started smoking pot so I was I was all-in I was all-in and then as I got wiser and then as I got not honest maybe not wiser just I started recognizing objectively why these these things are so attractive the fantastical is more attractive than the practical and so something else again I don't want I don't want to put Sitchin down and I'm here also to say that Sitchin did a lot of really good work he's a clever guy and he had a lot of very very very thorough research I just lost my track actually smoking too much dope where was I going what we were talking about that all the difference between the fantastical and the practical that there's this inclination to accept things that are fun yeah you know that's what I was going to say is that when you start talking about the Anunnaki those from heaven to earth cane these fantastic creatures from thank you you've brought my memoranda Bureau thing I remember I was got to say what's interesting some part because I know kind of once could be good what was what's what's interesting is that the level of technology that Zakaria attributes to the Annunaki oblique Nephilim that that level of Technology is the level of technology that we had in the 1970s when we were you know NASA was doing its stuff so it's NASA technology from the 1970s that is projected out on to that is projected over a gram but is projected out that is projected out on to his theory of the past now it seems to me very unlikely that the Nephilim or the Anunnaki would have had for four hundred thousand years which is what he's saying the same technology that NASA had in the 1970s is much more likely that he's projecting that on to the data rather than that it's actually inherent in the dot there was also some interesting ideas that he had that turned out to be ideas that scientists had also proposed about preserving our atmosphere by by levitating or by suspending reflective particles in our atmosphere and that that is something that the Annunaki in his books we're going to use gold for because gold has such unique properties which is why they use gold to plate things because you can take a little tiny piece of gold you could plate this entire table goals are really spectacular yeah a piece of I mean there's nothing like it right absolutely not there's a lot of really good material in Szczecin but unfortunately the translations of the texts the translations of the texts are not translations of texe they misrepresent the text often what he did was he took a nineteenth-century translation and he massaged it so that it would you know fit his fit his argument and that's a pity so we need skeptics and they help us to sift out the wheat from the chaff but but occasionally what the skeptics do with this drive to to criticize anything that's not mainstream occasionally what they do is they let go a really good idea which deserves investigation and which the human species could benefit from and that's my feeling is with this amazing species we've developed all this science why are we why are we so ready to let go of wonderful ideas well it's also fascinating to me that because of what Sitchin has been sort of criticized for people now ignore the stuff that's absolutely undeniable like the actual stone tablets themselves the clay tablets where you can see the depictions of the solar system somehow or another these people from 6,000 plus years ago had a detailed map of the sources clear idea of the source what's the size in like a relatively correct order in the planets in the right place like they somehow or another knew that Jupiter was bigger than Mars they knew these things in some weird way and we don't know why we don't know how also the caduceus representing the the the double helix of the DNA that's really fascinating concept to that the caduceus is used for medicine that's used to reports that Gaia did so it's kind of too bad there was so much crazy involved in that I think what any of us should do when we're exploring the deep and hidden mysteries of the past is is to go to a lot of different sources go to a lot of don'ts just stick with the mainstream don't just stick with the alternative but try to try to bring it all together and in a way that's what I try to do in my books accept the skeptics still hate them yeah but it is so hard because it's so it's so fun to go with the crazy story yeah like the the alien story is so compelling it's so fun very compelling story I mean if we found some sort of evidence of aliens it would be so utterly spectacular even if it was a simple alien like I've always said this that if we felt like got a jellyfish on the moon we would freak out but you know there's really complex bizarre things at the bottom of our ocean that we've never discovered just they're just not in the correct location for us to be excited and then the other the other issue we're getting slightly off our flood topic here actually but the other issue of entities that that in the encounters with entities anybody who's smoked DMT will know that as I have as you have that will know that you do encounter entities in the DMT in the DMT state and they do communicate with us and there's a lot of parallels with the ETS or the aliens as they're described in modern UFO abduction accounts and Rick Strassman have you ever had him on your show you know Rick got sick he was supposed to be here a couple of times we're trying to reschedule it now yeah but he had some pretty serious health issues now we had a date scheduled out but I love that guy got a chance to sit down with him a couple of times and talk to him and of course you presented DMT this molecule yeah he's brilliant and he's so important to me because I remember when I did it I was so confused I mean it to me it was like the first my first DMT experience changed everything I thought about the world and I immediately didn't give a shit about aliens anymore right like it was almost instantaneous like before then I was like Roswell they've got the they got the ship man yeah it's in a hangar but what I encountered doing DMT was so spectacularly alien it's a pedestrian concept of something that looks like a person but has a bigger head enlarged eyes at high attack yeah yeah it was weird and cool as it would be if it was real it was nothing I mean literally not one millionth as interesting as what you absolutely can encounter when you do DMT that's the aliens that's the aliens that utterly alien realm filled with alien intelligences who communed and of course again the skeptics say oh it's all just made up in your brain but we don't know that and Rick is open to the possibility that we are dealing with areas of reality that are not normally accessible to our senses and that become accessible to our senses by retuning the receiver wavelength of the brain which is what he suggests DMT does and I think I think that's very plausible and at the very least those who are interested in UFOs and aliens should be also investigating this line of inquiry can we can we use changes in consciousness to understand the majestic complexity of the universe in which we live and I think the answer is definitely yes and many of Rick's volunteers I paraphrase but they came back with reports that the entities who'd encountered them said we're so glad you've discovered this technology now we can communicate with you much more easily you know it's fascinating so there's a technology for encountering other intelligences and against that this mechanistic simplistic alien meme that's going around now that they're a bit like us but they came here in higher tech the higher tech it's dull by comparison with it is dull by comparison if you're interested in anybody is the book is amazing it's called DMT the spirit molecule and he has a new book that he's putting out about DMT and the spirit and the soul of prophecy yeah and he's just a really really interesting guy but his his experience that he did experiments that he did were the first I think in many many decades to get approved by the government correct so he did everything above-ground I mean he was above board he was did and because it because it was government approved the his remit was that he had to find some therapeutic benefit for DMT and he couldn't actually but that's not the point I'm sure actually there are therapeutic benefits but that's not the point the point is here is a tool for investigating the mystery of consciousness and the mysterious nature of reality and I mean fact me if we get five or six volunteers who haven't compared notes or coming back with met entities who said we're so happy you found this technology yeah it's hard to explain that as just to reduce it to brain activity not only that when we talk about things that are so big and are ignored by mainstream culture this is one that's just like that you're talking about an endogenous human chemical yeah that not only is in US but is in thousands of different plants like when how many different plants contain DMT huge numbers huge very prosaic ones like peas and you know well there's the money recorder okay yeah that's what I was gonna say the australian oriental tree is actually illegal this isn't that what would be the jerusalem the the professors from the university of jerusalem i believe that any shannon yeah what they were talking about they believe that that's what the story of the burning bush and moses is so that is Mimoza with the DMT and syrian rule with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor in other word it's it's ayahuasca but a Middle Eastern alternative of it doing the same thing we like molecularly and isn't it possible in some way that the idea of the burning bush was them figuring out how to dry or extract DMT never in it very light very possibly right because they're talking about the burning bush producing God yeah and it just so happens that this bush is the acacia tree is incredibly common in super-rich and DMT and it's all over the area and I should probably insert at this point that if you're at all familiar with the Masonic ritual you'll know that the acacia plant plays a central role that's why you're one of them one percent Mason characters every now every now it was inside every now and then on face book Randall I get accused of being a freemason Hancock is a freemason as know it explains as though it explains everything I know lots of Freemasons I spoken in Masonic lodges but I'm an author and I shouldn't belong to clubs you know I went to a few I went to a wedding that my friend Duncan Trussell was performing at for these two Satanists and like 2003 into this day I was the one of the lavas Anton LaVey or Stanton Levay whatever is his son oh and his son got married was some young hedonist you know and they call themselves Satanists and so Duncan performed at this wedding and I went there to this day I get fucking tweets about being a Satanist so I can't join your little club pal no one of your Masons I I need to confess you Graham yes you didn't realize this but I secretly initiated you oh my god oh you're in so he get in how do you self really initiate somebody can you do that yeah no okay yes I sort of did sort of so you could get him in if you wanted to though right if you know the people oh of course you even you Joe I don't think something's gonna happen bro I didn't I met a couple of Masons they're very cool well most masons don't really understand the corpus of symbolism that's that they're sitting on top of I got to say that not to get off on the Freemasons but simply there's a mass of symbolism and that's the whole that's that's the thing that they're custodians of and most of them don't have a clue what it means but they're doing an important job by preserving this corpus of symbolism through the through the layout of the lodge the the meaning of every component in the lodge because it's a purely astronomical allegory and then you have the Masonic carpets and that's where you have the whole story of the comet the flood it's all there the acacia plant it's all there it's all correct me for my wrong but it's it's all also an integral part of how Washington DC was designed is that true yeah just so much I haven't you know I honestly haven't studied that okay but what I've seen is that there's a there's a bunch of videos where you can watch it where they sort of describe how the layout you know is in some way some sort of sacred geometry I think what is based on Freemasons were massively involved in the construction of Washington as they were of many great cities city I live in England has got you know the major Masonic architecture so is it like people like me like my initial prejudice I hear something like the Masons I got fucking dudes in a cult get out of here leave me alone like we we assume that all groups of people that follow anything somehow another wacky Masons in my opinion they're largely a drinking club for men mainly that's what it is guys win at all but they do can make special arrangements to bring women into a lot of my life when I've get when I've given a talk in a lodge I've given talks in two or three lodges been asked to do so then they make a special ceremony to allow my wife Santa to come in because I won't go anywhere without Santa and so women can women can go in but then there are more there are others within masonry who are pursuing deeply esoteric interest and exploring the mysteries and you can have incredible conversations and facet it's just another another group of people who you know are doing are doing their thing it's not for me I wouldn't join I don't I would lose I think if I joined Freemasonry it would weaken me as an author I think I think I'm better able to comment on these things by not being a member of any such group that's interesting why do you think that well because I think I have to remain open to all possibilities and if I if I if I commit myself to a particular line I don't commit myself to a particular religion I don't commit myself to a particular men's club either I just which is what masonry is I I think if I commit that then a bit then ultimately I would become a spokesperson for that and I don't want to be that that makes a lot of sense considering your occupation and how important being open-minded has been to your life it's vital absolutely without it how could you have ever done fingerprints of the guys I could not you should have I mean and the the thing the initial thing where you were to tell me about Ethan that place where they believe that the the Ark of the Covenant lays which is one of the most bizarre ideas ever and that was my first book on a historical mystery with the sign on the ceiling that's right and when you go into it like it's so interesting but I just I've always imagined you as a young guy forced to sort of reconcile with this bizarre piece of evidence you've got these old men that have cataracts in their eyes like they're around radiation sites and no one's allowed to go inside and see this thing and they claim they have the Ark of the Covenant in there and like what the fuck is in there I think was the beginning of a magic it was the beginning of a magical journey for me it's been a magical journey for all your fans too for guys like me man when I read fingerprints of the gods it was to me it was one of those books I just couldn't put down and was so mind-blowing and this is again was in my the heart of my yeah fucking-a theorem and fingerprints was published in 1995 and magicians came out in 20 in in 2015 and I would say in that time the the evidence when I made the case for a lost civilization and a global Cataclysm in fingerprints of the gods I can't begin to account for the amount of hostility and anger and rage that I generated in the academic community the idea was considered to be absolutely absurd twenty years later with magicians of the gods it's not so absurd anymore the evidence is mounting we have incredible evidence now for a global Cataclysm in exactly the period that counts between twelve thousand eight hundred eleven thousand six hundred years ago and we have sites like gobekli tepe we have a redefinition of the Sphinx the whole area is just about to explode in in the future we're on the edge I believe of a paradigm shift and this comet material is central to it what I really appreciate about your courage is that you've also had the courage to admit when you've made mistakes you're not you don't in any way pretend to be some sort of a bearer of secret knowledge no one else possesses absolutely not a guru I don't want to be anything like that I'm a reporter that's that's what I am and I'm a reporter who's reporting on offbeat subjects and to some extent I'm an I'm an outsider so one of the talks I do now it's about being a being an outsider I think there is a I think there is a place for Outsiders in society well I don't think you're an outsider I think you're an outsider from the established mainstream ideas I just think that is what are the same we're both we're both outsiders in that area I'm working in different fields to get into this but don't you think that these established channels that were so deeply grooved in distributing information those things have widened so wide now what you're getting I mean a professor could do a podcast like he could teach a class you could write a book or he can do a podcast on a certain subject and like you're aware of Dan Carlin and that hardcore history podcast I just can't stop raving about what he's done is brought historical accurate but really dramatic stories of real events that took place to millions like you know that's just that no one's doing that like this is but it's not mainstream well what's more mainstream than being number one on the iTunes podcast list which he is all the time what is more mainstream and he must be getting millions of downloads it's part of the big change is taking place in our society that the old structures are being overthrown they're being thrown away it's a very uncomfortable time it's a very uncertain time is a very exciting time right because we can build out if there's something something amazing in the future the Internet's had a huge part to play in it the fact that people can communicate with one another all around the world since I've had a web presence in the last I was late comer but maybe 2 or 2 to 3 years ago I've been getting contacted by I mean professionals from around the world I've got probably a dozen major ones I've geologists who want to know more about and interestingly you said earlier about debating you know I'm always looking for somebody to debate about that right I you know because I have questions and I'm thinking maybe somebody even somebody who would disagree with me on something good still help me answer some of the questions right but I try to associate as much as possible and hang out with professionals in the field and of course what I discover is that a lot of them are working in these things part-time almost clandestinely without making it part of their you know if I go on a field trip of geologists into the flood lands none of them are really work full-time it's all part-time you know they're working for the government they're working for the oil companies or you know exploration mineral exploration whatever they're doing this research into geological catastrophes on their own time right but recently just last summer I got invited to actually present some of my research to the Atlanta Geological Society which is the largest Society of professional geologists in the southeast so I jumped at the chance rather than you know and so I presented hoping that I would get challenged that somebody would say wait a second there's a flaw in your thinking you didn't happen so did you make friends with some of these mainstream geologists oh yeah well I mean I've been known I mean I just took a trip for um in September spent 10 10 days back out in the flood lines and I did geologists with me on that trip so yeah I'm getting to know more and more people who are working as well you know I I majored in geology and cums I still am in touch regularly with the head of the geology department I see her pretty much on a regular basis and have been keeping her apprised of some of my stuff and she has off offered to sponsor me at whatever point I think that I can pull it together as a dissertation mm-hmm but we'll see how that goes I mean my objective was to learn geology not to become a professional geologist that wasn't interested in working for the government or working for you know the energy industry I had geological questions and that's why I made in geology and you've walked the walk and in my opinion you know more about this stuff than 10 fully PhD geologists yeah you always freak me out so what's what's fascinating to me about all this is that I think what you've done has been very measured you know everything you back up with facts and photographs and descriptions and disclaimers you know when you when you say well it's it is possible you will go down other various paths you're not dogmatic about these ideas but you've spent so much time going over this I don't know if there's another if there's a commensurate guy in mainstream archaeology that has been public about it the way you have been because if there is I feel like we probably would have heard about him your podcasts have been the ones that we've done they'd been seen by millions of people they didn't listen to by millions of people I mean the information is getting out there and making a real difference you're always going to have the the guys like I think Michael Shermer is very important and not criticizing him but that knee-jerk reaction to do something to mock something or put down something that's not mainstream like one of his tweets he said you know what archaeology with evidence is and he wrote archaeology like why would you even tweet that this doesn't make any sense like that someone who's not paying attention to work but made all you do is focus on Evan I'm reminded of the Shakespearean line methinks the lady doth protest too much why does he need to say that it's got the evidence you know it's like I see tweet like Fox News saying fair and balanced you know he's tweeting at you with this yeah meanwhile your entire book is based on photographic evidence yeah and all the other various pieces of evidence I mean that you're adding documents to each other without examining all these pieces of evidence yeah it's not these aren't things that you've invented no these are actual real sites that you can look at I'm drawing inferences from them that they don't like that's the thing well what Robert Schoch and guys like him are so important guys who have the courage see who's a Boston University professor absolutely encouraged to look at the stones and say this is the product of water erosion too cute us - Robert Schoch as a geologist as a career academic geologist who's taken that risk and put himself out there and followed the evidence where it leads another one is Danny Hillman Natta with judge' in Indonesia who's been responsible for the investigation of this extraordinary site at gunung padang where work has been stopped since 2014 again he's a highly credentialed geologist he's Indonesia's leading expert in megathrust earthquakes but he's been looking at archaeology bringing his geological expertise to that so that things are changing we are finding we are finding academics who are willing to engage and willing to to discuss I got into a very interesting City email correspondence with a guy called Daniel Loman at bar Beck but from the German archaeological Institute who's an architect and an archaeologist and he was very civil with me and I he answered my question into it in depth we had quite a long debate that's very refreshing that kind of thing wasn't happening 20 years ago yeah that is very refreshing now what about those pyramids in Bosnia has that been what is what is the deal with that by those thing I've been there I know Samos with magic personally Sam is the guy who's promoted the site I like Sam very much I must say when I'm in his aura I'm extremely convinced but when I when I look rationally at the at the so-called pyramids I don't think their pyramids I think they're Hills I did spend with Sam showing me around and it spent three days in Bosnia looking at the so-called pyramid of the Sun the pyramid of the moon-- the love pyramid and so on and so forth I do see that a tourist industry has built up around this and it's a fabulously beautiful intriguing site and the massive beautiful mountainous place but they are Hills they are not pyramids impression is given that there are tunnels passageways inside the pyramids that's not true the passageways are about two two and a half kilometers away they're very low-tech I just don't I just don't see it and for that reason I did not cover the Bosnian pyramids of the magician's of the gods I'm not going to say they're not pyramids I'm not going to write a book saying that they're wrong but I didn't excite me enough to justify devoting a chapter to them there's much more exciting and important archaeological discoveries that are being made like gobekli tepe which need more space and there's some there's some pyramid-like structures or hills in China as well right there's thousands of pyramids in China cien the province of Zeon is just the moment you land there four of your aircraft you're seeing pyramids everywhere I've been hearing that there there are certainly hundreds and hundreds of them distributed across fields vanishing off into the distance in all in all directions they've been terraced and used as agriculture but local farmers grow grow crops on them I went there with Chinese archaeologists they haven't excavated a single one not one why not they said we don't have this was nearly ten years ago I was there they said they probably got the money now but they said then they didn't have the money they said we're an old country we don't mind if we wait 200 years to get with this it's crazy and the famous tomb of the first emperor is part of this pattern it is also a pyramid it has also not been excavated the Terracotta Army around it has been firm the Terracotta Army is amazing oh yeah it was on display somewhere wasn't it where you can go and see it lie they did some kind of trap I want to see that thing I'd want to look at those things what what a bizarre concept now these pyramids so this one that this this Emperor was buried and that had the terracotta army was that a pyramid as well it is a period it is absolutely it's a man-made pyramid the Terracotta Army was buried around its edges not in the pyramid itself so the army was there to protect him yeah to protect his soul into the afterlife seems to have been the seams have been the idea and then there's a mythology that's come down that the within the pyramid is a lake of mercury that there are mechanical devices in there which will fire arrows at you if you go in that there's a whole story about how how intensely protected it is and up to this day it's not being excavated that's so crazy how could someone leave that alone and you know even major archaeological sites like Tiahuanaco in Bolivia for example you'll find that only about 2% of the site has been excavated I don't know how we can draw inferences about the whole site from from a tiny little fragment fraction like that and that's the that's the problem I think with archaeology and it's why we have to you know consider another way we're looking at an image of the Terracotta Army now you know in front of this pyramid and it is spectacular now that I think about it I don't think that was on display anywhere I think maybe they had a couple of them they brought some of them they came to the British Museum there were a number of museums Lee but it's so much bigger than I thought it was you know I mean there's I mean how many there's thousands yes thousands of these terracotta figures absolutely and this period was made out of what was it Stone round earth mainly okay so they just sort of shaped the ground they just dug around yeah they brought in earth and turn it into a pyramidal Mound over the but it wasn't just it's not massive stone blocks it's not massive stuff that's why they can grow crops on the sides of some of these pyramid weird yeah so they wouldn't build these giant mounds of dirt and then dig holes in him and support him well they probably created the interior you know subterranean as they were building the whole thing mmm and they just stacked dirt on top of it yeah wow what a weird way to make a house yeah and then we have to consider this with you know with with archaeological sites all all around the world is that any site may actually not be the product of just one culture but may have been reworked and worked over and used by many different cultures over this is different periods stunning to me um I found out about this because of a friend of John Anthony West who was here with him he showed me he lives in China and he showed me some video of it and I was like how do I not know about this I had no idea there's this many of them also here's one that's exposed what's this controversial ancient pyramids of China that one looks exposed blocky yeah well that is a another thing about China that we just don't have a clue when we when we think about the the age and scale of things we're so silly we've only been around since you know in 1776 is when the country was established it's not really that long ago you're dealing with China you're dealing with literally thousands of years of civilization all rising and falling and taking place and adapting and growing all in this one area mm-hmm that's still in our eyes in a lot of ways it's kind of behind right I mean they're behind environmentally they're behind when it comes to human rights consider this the Portuguese in the late 1400s have rounded the Cape of Good Hope and they've entered the Indian Ocean in their little ships they've entered the Indian Ocean and they actually establish a huge Empire they go to Malacca they go all over the place okay the seas are open to them if they had come forty years earlier they would have encountered the Chinese treasure ships ships that were 50 times larger than the little caravels that the Portuguese were sailing in Bastion you know what the Chinese did at that time they went through a period where they felt they just wanted to give gifts to people and they put together these huge fleets carrying incredibly precious gifts silks and ceramics and they took them all around the Indian Ocean and they just gave them to people so off the coast of East Africa and in East Africa you can find remains of this pottery from this episode and then a Chinese emperor came along and he closed the doors burned all the boats shut everything down and didn't let anybody speak to China for 200 years whoa what a dick well he he felt it was time for the Chinese culture to turn inward yeah and he they were afraid that they were that their ancient culture on one and there might have been maybe a laudable motive in that they were concerned that the ancient culture was going to get contaminated by too much contact with wasn't that generate cultures from other places and that was a factor in it that the constant desire to maintain the current situation human we have to say it's some kind of some kind of human nature yeah for sure I'd love to see some of these images of it yeah let's look as the drone stuff from the chemists that come as Prairie and what what is it please unless let's let's have a look at you got that this Chinese parents are still blowing my mind they blow my mind as well I just can't believe they haven't been asked it's an eerie spooky scene I would I recommend anybody to go to SIA not just just it's incredible how many of them there are and how unexplained it all is and it's again it feeds into my general point is we don't remember our past what are we looking at here okay let's let's can we pause so I can talk about what we're looking at yeah you look at this one that way you could hit the mic right in front yeah okay this is the beginning but okay what here's what really I mic right up to you that we're looking at a place in western Montana called Camas Prairie and you see some hills in the foreground and you see a basin in the background right okay right here on top of this hill and down on the side here you see that there are some coring operations those are coring gravel because everything you're looking at here this whole landscape between the hills are these large masses of gravel trillions of tons of gravel now what we're going to do is we're going to start sweeping around as the video plays and you're going to load us down here a series of ripples okay I see that okay and I'm going to have Jamie pause in a second but let's keep coming around you start seeing the ripples on your landscape let's pause right there right there let's pause now I wish I had a pointer but if you look up you're going to see a flat piece of land like a tongue coming out rounded out Jamie's right here that's it gets you a laser that's a delta that's a delta you know what a delta is you ever heard of the Delta it's when a river comes into a body of water and it's carrying sediment and because the river is moving along swiftly it's carrying the sediment but when it comes into the standing body of water it slows down and it drops its sediment it builds a Delta the whole city of Portland for example is built on a giant Delta all right New Orleans is built on the Delta right okay so what we're seeing there is a Delta and then in front of it we're seeing rippled landscape let's keep coming around Jamie and so enfold landscape that looks exactly like the beach looks yeah keep coming around with us the thing is fractal because this this is the whole mystery of this that this happens at a scale of inches on beaches and a scale of hundreds of feet here stop again okay Lord now right here in the middle you see a massive Delta yes you know like a big tongue splayed out and then right down here you start seeing the ripples and there's a farmhouse you see the farmhouse then now those ripples are the tallest ones are about the height of a five-story building whoa how does our keep okay let's keep keep sweet swinging around stop it stop this for a second um if you don't mind are these things they're the size of a five-story building what is that like 70 feet or something 50 feet okay so that's those are 50 feet high and how much water will we'll get to that let's see let's see the rest of it and these are just dirt right there there well if you dig into one what you're going to find is they're they're a massive okay let's pause the game look at this this is crazy this is totally crazy this is one of the craziest things you'll ever see this is these ripples repeated ripples in an area where there's nothing else like it this is the fingerprints of the flood that's what it is Wow where can someone look at this how does someone look at this in real you know this right now this is what we're looking at this is this video well my colleague Brad young did this with his drone and I think he's got it on the website geo cosmic-ray is this being played in the YouTube video right now okay all right so the YouTube people are cool with it if you're listening on itunes we'll find it find it on youtube but it's worth looking at it's what my point this is this is mind blowing shit and I think I think you made the crucial point Joe which is which is that we can understand what this is because we can see it on any beach we can see how water flows receding across a sandy medium will produce ripples but here they're on this unbelievable scale where they're hundreds of feet long and 50 feet high where they dwarf houses and they're lying all across and that - what that tells us is that a huge water flow went across this plane and did this you will seeing it from this perspective love which is a rare perspective unless you're in a plane or helicopter or something you get a chance to look at it this way you really get a better sense of what it is if you were on the ground there you'd probably say oh look at all the hills hard to see you don't quite get the impression though we did visit this this location and in to that day it was overcast so you don't quite get the effect like you do when you've got when a low Sun angle mm-hmm really helps you to see what what what's going on in the landscape can I ask you is there a dispute to this is there um no no nobody disputes it nobody knows because this is not from a flood not anymore Wow no in fact it was this JT part let's be fair nobody disputes that it was caused by massive water flows there but those same people would still not buy into the notion that there was this one humongous flood okay so they think into the cumulative effect but this was all created for the bottom of Lake Missoula right yes and this is supposed to actually represent the draining of Lake Mazu right where as I argue from a number of different reasons that this is the filling right Missoula I have a friend of mine who his friend lives in Montana and they found a dinosaur on his ranch allow yeah like really recently goodnight we should go back to that because there's a connection yeah the well the Great Western inland sea all that at that area there was this is a crazy place at one point in time it still is arguable yeah a different way the the water here Joe that did this the way to visualize this is to gain begin to think a tsunami you have to think tsunami because the tsunami is the closest scale of water flow that we've experienced in modern times no River flood has even approached this well no no flooding any floodplain nothing that we can put into perspective right the closest the closest we can get to it is a tsunami but even there you got to picture the tsunamis that we've experienced in the last decade and a half and you know in in Indonesia in Japan when they made landfall those tsunamis were roughly between 20 and 50 feet depending on where you were relative to the to the oncoming wave and how far distance you were from it here what you have to visualize is a tsunami sweeping over the land that's over a thousand feet deep that's that's what happened here and we know that because we can trace the the high-water marks on the hillsides are clearly left the high-water marks are clearly etched into the into the hillsides so we now know based upon the study of the ripples in the water here was moving down it's filling this Basin it's rushing in and a great tsunami from the north of freshwater meltwater coming off the ice sheet and it's sweeping down over this land at probably two or three hundred million cubic feet per second which is an inconceivable amount of water it's it's many times in excess of every River flowing on earth flowing today all at once it's it's beyond that many times ten or twenty times beyond that one of the trickier things about water is that water in itself it's kind of fractal in some sort of a weird way when you look at the actual molecule of water it's almost like we don't we don't distinguish it as being a fractal thing because we see it as like this moving phloem but if you're looking at the actual molecules of water the cup of water Withey that you dip your fingers in which is seemingly completely innocuous and becomes this massive element of change when the volume is a thousand feet high and just rolling over with massive amounts of weight behind out it's that same stuff massive amounts of weight enough enough way besides that it's actually causing seismic responses is only imagine you know how much weight are you talking about that can create these 50 foot high walls but this what's fascinating to me is that we don't have we we don't have a scale like in our minds as a reference like the difference between that little cup and these gigantic waves that you see that surfers travel by jetski to get to you know the off of a believe it's Mexico right ever seen those massive waves they go way out miles out to get to these crazy waves and we ride them in there like 60 70 feet high like that's that's the comparison almost like a glass of water to those waves and then that to the it scales up it scales up it scales up and at a certain point it can change the whole story of civilization almost doesn't compute let you can intellectualize it but it's almost not computing one of these flood flows here is three orders of magnitude greater than the largest measured modern flood in other words over a thousand times greater in terms of peak discharge or volume you would have to scale up at least a thousand times greater than any modern measured flood to get to the smallest really of these flows here because this is this is just one read one place one locale of on five states where you can trace the the literally the ocean of fresh water sweeping across the entire Pacific Northwest pretty much washing away anything that was there it's almost like we have a defense mechanism built in where we ignore how vulnerable we really are like we put it maybe that's one of the reasons why people are so reluctant to really go deep into studying asteroid impacts I think we're or even to pay attention to this stuff like that this could happen and this is I mean the those are not two separate subjects because this is the result of the comet impact on the on the ice cap this this is the this is why I feel that the research in this field is so vital okay right there yeah now here notice this is great that's a beach we go but it's a beef it's a beach for giant monsters yeah what it is you can see in this here that you've actually got three massive currents converging here do you see that over here right you've got a massive current coming in that would be from the west and then we're standing we would be standing looking down current of course this the the drone I'm guessing here is about 200 feet in elevation so the top of the water was another eight to nine hundred feet above this perspective right here and it's moving very very fast and it's sweeping down into a river valley that's down in those mountains you see in the distance and from there it's being carried down and joining up other equally as large floods coming in from other valleys and all of this is happening at once and it's covering five states basically and that's just one region that's being affected by this sudden catastrophic melting of the ice sheets they are dealing with the largest flood that ever occurred on earth it's a simplest yeah this is insane I mean it's insane look at it a lot here in North America and it happened twelve thousand eight hundred years ago and it's story has yet to be fully told isn't it possible there was something larger before like the 65 million year ago one that hit the Yucatan like what you know what kind of an impact did that have well it actually would because if dad had happened 12,000 years ago we wouldn't be him none of us would be here yeah that'd be a wrap right yeah that was a single large oblique about six miles wide that was that was a much more devastating impact than the impact of twelve thousand eight hundred years ago but nevertheless those impacts of twelve thousand eight hundred years ago were really really bad and they did stuff like this and anything that was in the way of this of these massive flows of water would have been rubbed completely from the story see this all makes sense yeah and here's the thing that the Michael schirmer's don't get when you understand the extent of this the scale of this phenomena and the severity the unconceivable severity of this in the aftermath of an event like this what would remain of a city of village a refrigerator I know not a goddamn thing no nothing nothing how much what nothing would exist in the aftermath of this and most things wouldn't exist I mean you find like an old refrigerator or car up on blocks in someone's backyard in the south and it's in 1970s and the the rot has gotten into frame the H is gonna eat it up nature's eating it up just a couple of decades right what's it gonna be like in a couple thousand years we should on exist should not be surprised about how little we really know about our past this is also a comfort game with our ecology oh yeah we've got the past all worked out we understand it here is what we teach in schools this is what our friends in the media report this is the facts not the facts we know nothing it's there's been so much lost so many missing pieces of the puzzle that we're you know desperately trying to stitch together and it's important I think that we actually do get some clarity on events like this because we still live on this planet and we have kids and we have a future and we want to hopefully want to hopefully we want if one of those big boys comes our way well that's that's right but again I come I come down to this which is which is that we are not dealing with gloom and doom and the end of the world we're dealing with a problem that humanity should be confronting we should not be sticking our heads in the sand we should be confronting this problem and that's why I support the work of the comet research group because they are the only people right now who are confronting this problem and really getting to grips with it we should all confront I mean we should absolutely all support them and confront it because this if something like this can happen once what's it's what what really makes sense is how many stories of floods there are in ancient times and how many parallels there are there are and how many there are from North America tells dozens and dozens yeah it was the Caitlin the Indian artist who spent 30 years or so pre Civil War I think maybe a decade after the Civil War painting Indians of different tribes and he wrote a book called last Ram bolts among the North American Indians very very interesting book but what really is interesting to me when I read the book years and years ago was his final conclusion of the book he says after all of these different customs and traditions that have been handed down amongst these tribes they all have one thing in common they all have a memory or a story of a gigantic world destroying flood and he and he this was concluded tribes down into Central America that he visited I I believe the Americas are the repository that the Native American peoples who have been subjected to so much destruction over the years they in their mythology their traditions their memories they keep more of this than almost anybody else it's rit's rhe it's really tragic what has happened in the Americas from the time of the Spanish conquest the deliberate destruction of knowledge that the the terrible horrendous abuses that Native American people suffered they are our wisdom keepers they are the people who passed down the oral tradition and and remember the past so not only do we have cataclysms wiping the human memory but we ourselves actively get involved in the human memory and wipe it we rub it out the burning of the Maya codices by the Spanish friars thousands and thousand oh what was in those documents yeah you know we might have had a whole other story about ourselves if we could have had access to those but instead we're this destructive cannibalistic species that just goes and smashes everything to bits it's a weird impulse that human beings have is when they move into an area and take over it one of the things they like to do is destroy their icons destroy every what's going on with Isis and all these ancient Buddhist structures a thousand plus year old beautiful sculptures absolutely they're blowing them up yeah you know and in yelling praise God while they're doing it it's really very bizarre it's a very bizarre inclination that we have with it so it's almost like we don't want people to know you know it's as a bizarre almost human instinct to wipe out the past and just to constantly keep moving or was there some trauma is there some collective trauma some be please deeply suppressed memory could be but that we that we can't quite confront that's that's exactly the thought I had because I think that's the one way one of those areas were Velikovsky finally really nailed it was mankind in amnesia that somehow we carry this the Trump because once you begin to get to get a handle and you get to get the picture of these events as they occurred and did occur and would have been experienced by our ancestors you've got to understand what would it be like to see you're entirely young completely obliterated starting over again from basically a barren mud filled hmm you know were you that's essentially what these people were faced if they lived at all and so fabulously they did because where we are but you know again the evidence is emerging of major cultural collapse if you had a guess what percentage of the population of human beings just as obviously just a guess but how many do you think were wiped out half of them three-quarters of them I don't think that would be unrealistic no it doesn't seem like it would be and if it was that number and those people that's enough for people to survive and if it was that number boy what a strange fucking mythical past they would have the other the other thing that bear in mind is in the world today our world we have an advanced civilization America you know Germany that the industrialized technological countries and we have coexisting with them in South America in the the Namibian desert we have hunter-gatherers so the the notion that hunter-gatherers and an advanced civilization might coexist right in the same epoch of history should not be strange to us because we're doing that today and that's what I would suggest happened before twelve thousand eight hundred years ago before the Cataclysm of twelve thousand eight hundred years ago that there was a fairly advanced civilization that was capable of mapping and exploring the world creating gigantic works of architecture and it coexisted with hunter-gatherers and who were the ones who survived the Cataclysm the answer is the ones who survived the Cataclysm were the hunter-gatherers not the sophisticated people's a few of them survived and they then settled amongst the hunter-gatherers and tried to transfer some of their knowledge and skills to them and it's the same today if we if we were to have a repeat of the Younger Dryas Cataclysm today I don't think that people from Los Angeles or London would be amongst the leading survivors right I think the survivors would be people like the hunter-gatherers of the Amazon rainforest because they're in the business of surviving that's what they do it's not a mystery to them it's not even a problem they do it they do it all the time they would they would carry the human story forward and ten thousand years from now their descendants would be telling a myth about how there was once a great civilization on this planet so advanced that they could even go to the moon they could fly around the planet they could speak to one another on other sides of the earth but they did something wrong they fell out of harmony with the universe they ceased to wear their prosperity with moderation that's actually a line from Plato about Atlantis Wow and the universe slapped them down so there would be a differential survival rate those who were that I would say that those who are more technologically advanced are less likely to survive because they depend on a complex interrelated network of skills and any individual on his or her own most of them well you're different jokers you do know how to survive but a lot of people don't know how to barely know how to survive most likely so you've worked at it yeah I'm not that good at it but most of us most of us haven't even worked at it at all we haven't got a clue let me fucking open everybody's eyes to all these people to think that you could just go out there and shoot annals and stay alive good fucking luck you're you're probably screwed if you have a rifle even if you have a rifle you're probably screwed if you have a bow and arrow you're gonna fucking starve to death right it's extremely difficult yes to get close you know and yet hunter-gatherers for thousands and thousands of years have succeeded in doing that like that the Bushmen of the Kalahari I think there was less humans and more animals right I think that's also part of the rub okay it's like we're dealing with is that one of the terrible things we've done is taking these giant swaths of land and made them entirely inhabitable for wildlife like cities like you how many people grow food in the city that what is the percentage is it even 1/10 of 1% of people in the city grow their own food probably no probably not even that so you have these massive essentially deserts with where no wildlife exists other than predatory species like coyotes and ravens and things like that and take and then you you you go out from there and then you have these vast farmlands yeah the only benefit of the vast farmlands is the amount of deer that exist now is greatly more than when Columbus landed but it's because they've almost become an agricultural animal it's almost like they're almost a domesticated animal they're a free wild domesticated animal I have a friend who has a farm in Iowa and when you go there it's very strange because he's got these wild giant 300-pound forest horses running around his backyard I mean they're fucking everywhere there's all these giant deer and when we were there it's what's called the rut so all these they're very horny so the big bucks are usually high they show themselves I'm like this is a crazy place like there's all these wild animals that exist along with people and even in a game rich place like that it's incredibly difficult to get to one you have to have vegetables you'd have to have your own vegetables so let's imagine the situation where all the resources of our cities all the yeah all the amenities all the infrastructure are gone most of us are fucked I would say radically ours I would say in fact our civilization which appears so strong is actually very very fragile extremely just a little push it's like when you look out the window and you're like wow that's the outside no that's a piece of glass you're outside it's not that piece of glass in your outside you know the effortless it is it just seems in petrol because you know you pull the shades tight and you set your alarm clock in asleep you're sleeping next to glass yes like it's hilarious you feel confident yet you're sleeping next to a piece of fucking glass there's this incredible complacency and arrogance yeah of modern civilization that we are the apex and pinnacle of the human story that we're the best that's ever come and and and that's a danger mythologically that is a very dangerous place to be when you start imagining yourself as the apex and the pinnacle of everything that's precisely when the universe reminds you that you are not that at all yeah it's a very weird existence that we have well we just sort of look at how things are right now and we can't imagine things being any different no matter what whether it's people that have to come to the realization that they've been injured like if someone breaks their leg and also it just doesn't compute like how come I can't walk anymore well your reality is now shifted and this reality that we have here with this fairly healthy earth could shift at any moment that the the Yellowstone Volcano is the one that's been freaking me out the most over the last few years another big issue yeah an interesting pair would be if we look at small or what happens in smaller catastrophes like we've seen today when we look at the ad for example when Katrina hit and hit New Orleans right it was almost as if the human species separated into two sub species you had one group of people that rose to the occasion and did heroic things they organized and they saved people spontaneously you know because the government was conspicuously absent for five days the first five days of the Katrina disaster and here you had a major flooding of New Orleans and and you had people spontaneously organizing and performing these heroic actions of saving their fellow man and and doing just stupendous things super hero type things but then you had another segment to the population it just went completely barbaric and you had mass rapes and you know smashing of businesses and looting and in and just people running in it wild complete unrestrained gangs just and just committing violent acts at random so in America the richest country on earth did not manage that crisis well no I mean it was very and that was a little crisis by comparison with what we're talking member when Kanye West go on TV George Bush does not like black people I don't remember that but yeah George Bush I think was on day for George Bush flew over an Air Force One and know the window wave yeah yeah give me below but there's there's a lesson lessons in those kinds of events sure we're not prepared and we have to extrapolate from that and and you know if you go back and what you know I often time as a thought exercise think how how would we respond if we knew that there was a high probability of a younger dryest type event or series of events impending in our future what would you do to start drinking there well you know it all depends on lead time right it all fits on lead towards a 10-day lead time like you know the shoot a rocket up there and man I really super again and let's just go hard go hard to the end yeah ten days but ten years or twenty moons then we can do some stuff then we can do some stuff the real scary thing is to scary things one if you survived because you're like fuck you know if you if you really did survive and everybody else was jacked and also in you're dealing with some Mad Max type reality where people are starving to death and they're very desperate and they become almost like animals that's entirely inside the realm of possibility well that's what we learned from Katrina or the other terrifying possibility is that you leave the future of civilization up to those other people is that they survive and they have kids and their kids survive and somehow another somewhere along the line we get better and better at understanding our place here which is what I think has happened yeah and all it would take is one I mean this is as much as people are complaining right now as much as there's riots in the streets because it excuse me protests in the street some riots apparently but over the president-elect what this time is it represents the greatest time in history when it comes to safety when it comes to knowledge access to information the way we understand each other I don't think it's ever been better as far as long as we know we have everything at our feet yeah there's there's incredible potential in modern civilization the but the problem is that there's also very rigid mind control the way that our societies work is it's turning people into drones people people brought up to believe that their only purpose in existence is production and consumption the people forced to fit into a sort of narrow place in the Machine mass media beaming you know messages at us at us all the time even the concept of democracy is absurd when you don't when you don't have complete transparency when there are secrets when things are hidden how can the people vote you know with Alia with clear minded if a lot is being hidden from them that's not democracy democracies in fact invest in in mind control most unfortunate development well I I wonder how long it's going to take before the rigid mindsets that are in place right now on this idea of this resistance to change that we were talking about when it comes to science when it comes to the accepting this asteroid will impact theory and I think that exists in politics I think it exists in religion I think it exists socially the way we approach relationship and friendships and just all of it is evolving in front of our eyes I was watching a movie last night not another teenage movie I said what it is that was called and I was live-tweeting it so smoking pot and writing and sometimes I just like to have the TV on and not listen to it just just sometimes I like to like see some things when just writing things sometimes I know that last night I chose to do it that way and I just got so enamored in this weird movie from 2001 this is a the movie felt like a time machine as like I was watching this culture that does not exist anymore it's one of those like teenager movies where like in college and they're drinking there's a lot of naked women and really racist sexist humor and its really crude and Goofy and stupid and I'm like this is so bizarre because they this doesn't exist anymore this kind of film like this is like this is like Al Jolson with blackface on or something and in a way it's like a cultural time machine like you get to go and for a brief moment see like this comedy that somebody concocted in 2001 which seemed so recent but it's such a in that film you get evidence of this weird cultural change our students a weird massive cultural change that's happened as far as we're we're allowed to joke around about things I'm just embrace it shit in that movie like racist and sexist shit and violence like men punching women in the face and shit like that you just can't really do in a comedy to that mm-hm and that's only 15 years ago and what what is it going to be like if we can avoid getting hit by a rock blowing ourselves up Yellowstone blowing up in our face if we can keep going I think we're on a great path I think our lesson where I'll think about the president-elect and I think we're on a great path it's a hazardous past it path it so it's a path where the future is not at all certain but but Humanity is at one of those moments mother's crossroads where you kind of stand on the edge of an abyss and and you don't quite know what lies ahead and we can take a really great path out of this or we can take a really horrible path right and I I think the key issue is that we do actually have choice it doesn't have to be that way I see a lot of positive a lot that's positive out there out there in the world I do think people are waking up I think they are questioning old structures they're refusing to put up with the bullshit any longer more and more people are doing that is happening in the realm of politics is happening in the realm dealing with the big corporations it's happening in the realm of investigating the past we're just not going to be told what to think anymore that's encouraging but then on the other side there are huge efforts being put precisely into making people think in certain ways whether it's the advertising industry whether it's political messages and so we have to be aware of that and it could go it could go down the drone path I mean like the bee The Beehive path which would be a wipe even bothered to be human if your society is turning you into a work at drone in a bee hive life existence or it could go down an expansion of consciousness and a realization of the incredible beautiful potential of the human race I honestly feel like that's where it's going I do John sleet I'm optimistic I'm very up to missile that's beautiful to hear because this is a time I was watching that John Oliver show it's a great show on HBO very funny guy and his very left-wing leaning and as is his show but they had this fuck 2016 thing where they were just naming off all the horrible things that happen in 2016 though and then just saying goodbye to this terrible year I'm like yeah but a lot of good shit happened this year too there's a lot of fantastic discoveries a lot of interesting observations a lot of people learned a lot of things in 2016 as well and I think that I'm quite a number of American states have made cannabis legal yes that's I think you know there's a huge development it's it's also a big it's going to be a big factor in our cultural evolution it really well well it was a big factor in the 60s it was a huge factor in an in effect what happened you had a very closed conservative society and then you had an outside shock in the form of the psychedelic drugs that came in and completely stirred up everything in art and music and fashion and even into scientific concepts of our place in the universe and time and space and in in so many ways that had just a major impact on the direction in our society when and what would be the equivalent today or in our near future in terms of an outside shock that would suddenly wake people up would be another event another Tunguska event and based upon everything that I've seen it would suggest that events like that are going to happen and probably within our lifetime and when it does happen especially if the message of the story has been out and enough people have heard it five percent of the people or ten percent of the people are aware that there is this major impending potential paradigm shift and then we have an event like that an event like Tunguska 1908 I think that's all it would take because the the magnitude of that event would have been such that it occurred today and you had anywhere from a million to two million people instantly wiped out or a whole city instantly annihilated from a thing from a shot from space what effect would that have on the planetary consciousness in which with this latest exercise NASA coming late to the party finally seems to be thinking about you know that what happened they finally see what happened if LA is hit by you know a 350 foot diameter right in epidemic ulna is because well when that when the the probability models for a Tunguska type event were first laid out in the 50s and 60s and into the 70s it was pretty much determined that it was like something that would happen once a millennium once every couple of millenniums then it sort of got contracted to once every few centuries you know it may be that it's actually much more like one or two a century or maybe even perhaps clustered events where you may have three or four or half a dozen of those type events occurring over a very short window of time but an event like that happening not one that would be caused the extinction of civilization by any means but an event like that that could you know wipe out a thousand square miles of landscape completely in an instant would have a major effect I think on the people of this planet it would focus Minds it would focus minds in a way that nothing else would and I it's not to me is it pessimistic to say that might be what it's going to take or is it just realistic I don't know well I think it's like the the massive impact versus the slow trickle effect I mean is it going to happen eventually or is it going to happen in one gigantic swoop because of an event like a asteroid Olymp act where it kills a bunch of people and we wake up to the fragility of our existence but either way it's a waking up of humanity and that is in process that is happening that is in process now look as a as a Brit observing what's been happening in America as an outsider I'm enormous ly encouraged by the legalization of cannabis movement that is that is taking place here and and and what it and what it all means sure I like to smoke a joint but this is not about getting high it's not about recreation what this is about is recognizing the sovereignty of adults to make decisions over their own bodies their own health and their own consciousness while doing no harm to others that's what it's about and that's a really fucking important issue that is for me that is the most important issue because if we live in a society that is not prepared to recognize adult sovereignty over one's own body and one's own consciousness then that cannot be a free society in any meaningful way and so I applaud the people of America in those states who have voted for full legalization that's a brilliant thing to do and that's going to have an impact around the world because the war on drugs all the ideology and lies about cannabis are all going to be proved wrong we're going to know that the Emperor wears no clothes that you can legalize cannabis and civilization does not fall apart as the war on drugs Lobby have been telling us for ages it's going to it's going to change everything and it's a beautiful thing because it's the American people whereas the American State America as a governmental state presence on the world stage has been the dark force behind the war on drugs so it's it's a to me a beautiful thing that is the American people state-by-state who are winding that back and saying we will not put up with this shit anymore I think what you were talking about earlier is really important to we're talking about different factions of our civilization or creating it to this day they're still creating disinformation and still trying to mislead people but I think that goes to what we're talking before were it's a system and systems protect themselves and I think that they develop almost a consciousness of their own it's scary in a way yeah yeah bureaucracies arm the bureaucracies they've got a kind of personality well even when there's no financial stake in it there's just a social stake like what you're seeing right now with the left versus the right yeah like there's some people like my friend Wanda Sykes just got booed off stage at something last night apparently what she went on some anti-trump rant and then and people got super upset at her there's these systems that are in place this this is this why almost like wanting to fight like it's not it sets us up in this bizarre team mentality where this left protects its ideas of the future and the right protects its ideas and I'm watching these people go at it back and forth on social media and it's toxic and I don't like to use that term because it's so compromised by you know toxic sexuality or toxic masculinity so many uses of that word in our culture but I think that this desire to fight with each other and be deeply unpleasant it's a really horrible hurtful gosling things you see it so often and really I mean vile and from the left too as well as the right the left is toxic toasters the right word exactly and I think that we have to resist the urge to fight I think this is when people push too far on the left that's when the alt-right emerges when people push too far on the right that's when the left comes up and you know that's when you know Kent state emergency you have all these weird factions duking it out that have so much in common yeah and a lot of times the things that they don't have in common it's either because of an ignorance or it's because of an ideological dispute or a lack of communication and I think of those three things are in place at least open lines of communication Lynch is also fostered by marijuana and get these people talking openly and vulnerably about these things and you find out that a lot of our misgivings and our misunderstandings about each other or just misconceptions miscommunications and we probably even if we disagree on things I have friends that I disagree on a lot of stuff with but we're very close yeah because world you're allowed to have different opinions of course that's what makes the world interest doesn't have to be we held at each other because we're weak is weak listen to somebody else's opinion with empathy rather than with hatred or anger we have were too it's too attractive to be on a team make the fucking maison it's very elegant yeah it is man it's it's too attractive it's too attractive and we'd love I mean we love city versus city we love that we love when you know Chicago's gonna take on Cleveland fuck you we love that the tribal is the tribal thing you know we've not really evolved out of that we've changed our social structures but we're still tribal tribal mentality we should nationalism is just tribalism writ large yeah so it really is just like religions just a cult with a lot more people yeah exactly yeah should we look at one more yeah we could look at as many as you want man Oh Rolla party what do you got yeah let's see the next one back to the flood this is the place that I didn't get to take grams that I really wanted okay I really wanted to take you here let's see it lets see it so you're gonna see it second best okay possibly this is the potholes holy shit look at that this is crazy this what we're looking at folks that people who are just listening in you have to go to the YouTube now cuz this is insanity this is as close a like a knot for a dummy like me to look at something like that and then go fucking you for yeah that's definitely a river a river carve that okay what you're looking at there is a gigantic extinct set of cataracts like you would find it Niagara Falls but to use grams to large we're looking at a ridge we're looking east the tsunami wave that swept down over these four states one branch of it swept off to the west this particular branch of it was 400 feet deep when it hit this Ridge and what it did was it spilled over the ridge and down here in the foreground you see the modern-day Columbia River from the top of the ridge where you see the the agriculture in the landscape down to the rivers about a thousand feet well so you basically have to picture you've got this huge sheet of water three to four hundred feet deep it's rushing over and it finds a low little lowest spot within this Ridge and that's where it starts focusing its energy and as it does it begins to just strip away the rock now what you're looking at here is this cataract complex is about five miles across and the otter came in you see you've got those kind of curved finger lakes at the top and those tunnels those are potholes that's insane potholes are formed by underwater turbulence and in a flood this swiftly-moving with this much turbulence you literally have four ticular Eddie's high intensity high amplitude high energy underwater tornadoes literally underwater tornadoes now these underwater tornadoes are typically in this case about a half a mile walk oh my they're spinning at a high rate of speed and they're right there they're probably 600 feet deep because the water pouring over the ridge is at least 200 and you can see what it's done to the bedrock anybody listening you got a wall you got to look at this you have to look at this and then listen to the scale this is this is a gigantic scar in the landscape of which there are hundreds around this the exact location Rundle this is potholes cataract right the exact location that it was to get to it which were in Washington State still yes we're in Washington say central Washington's can be right on the Columbia River just below Wenatchee okay where we saw that where we saw that huge that huge erratic yes giant 18,000 ton Boulder brought there and chained in an iceberg an iceberg floating on the flood carry an iceberg the size of an oil tanker carrying an 18,000 ton Boulder carried on the flood grounds 700 feet up of Raleigh side rests there as the flood waters recede the ice melts away and the boulder is left sitting what we're gonna be sure of that Boulder in a second one of the people back in this part of the country what do they think about this well you know they're only just catching on to what they're sitting on top of he's the first time I went out here 98 there was the the ice age floods Institute and I went to their only location which was a which was in the Better Business Bureau in in Moses Lake Washington and it was they had one room boom in the back of this Better Business Bureau Chamber of Commerce Chamber of Commerce and there was two elderly ladies in there who are basically the the overseers of the group now there's about two dozen chapters and every year there's several guided field trips led by geologists who are studying this in their off time and I've been on a number of these just to participate and get the air the access to the geologists in order to pick their brains but this is this is very close to when a Qi Washington so anybody he's wanting to find this on Google Earth this is a Google Earth image now what we're going to open but before we leave the Google Earth image I was going to explain that you've got those you got those see those lakes those this meandering lakes up mhm what you got a picture is you've got a sheet of water coming and as it's coming over this Ridge it's beginning to selectively erode into fault lines and cracks within the bedrock can you picture that the water is going to naturally try to go into those low spots where there's cracks and fissures and it'll start going from a sheet into channeling mmm what goes from sheet to a channeled in then that spills over the ridge and in the middle you see this it's called a rock blade see that the wrong laid is that debts that yes that's it right there separating the two alcoves if the flood had continued for another few days that rock blade would have been gone and you would have had a single alcove up there now in the next as this proceeds what we're going to do is we're going to go down and we're going to be right at the head of the rock blade right there yeah right there we're standing right there so now you're going to get to see as the drone is about to take off you're seeing the landscape we're looking to the east in the direction of those Finger Lakes and I guess the soundtrack is it not playing the sound not oh there we go in here a little Toccata and Fugue in d-minor oh okay and the landscape opens up so you're on that rock blade we're on the rock blade right there that's so now you can begin to see the scale of this thing that we were just seeing from Google Earth well now the way when you describe it I mean I would have just looked at it and go wow that's kind of cool-looking I would never have thought so that was obviously created by water pouring through that's the problem is because we haven't had the scale of perception it took Brett's 25 years to put the pieces together well also we haven't been able to take these sort of high-resolution photographs cause they're wrong he's right above it till recently yeah that's that's it gives us a whole other insight I mean you used to be $1,000 an hour to get up there in a helicopter now you can fly a drone around you know it would have known yeah exactly GoPro on it right here in the middle ground you see that big hole that's about 200 feet in diameter that's that's a pothole that was created by this swirling vortex of massively turbulent water holy shit this is incredible yeah in otherwise the evidence is all over the landscape oh staring us in the eyes and it's only in the recent years that it started to make sense we've evolved the the eyes to be able to see this and so now by going out here with a draw I've been over this landscape several times in a small plane to see it from that perspective but now like he just said like Graham just said now we've got a drone it can go up and see it from a whole different perspective and and now you can see see they see the man standing right down there on the rock no you see all that little dude yeah yeah little that little dude is 6 feet tall he's not that liveable I mean on the pictures little no no in July we are 4 inches it's it's it's an illusion what's the me stunning that we knew this is really beautiful and cool and everything like that but what's really stunning is the initial picture where it becomes so obvious that above picture we see the farmland and that just it's so obviously cut cut sliced out of the lens let's see the rest of it then as the drone flies over yeah so and then we have what's called classic scab land you see all these mounds these kind of lumps that's what are the scabs on the scab land that's why it's called scab land and again it's flooding that causes it plucking slifer entually plucking material off the surface mmm wow this is incredible and in this water remaining yeah then fill fill the pie yeah God yeah there you get a saw Mike there you get a sense of the rock blade well there you get a sense of what the volume of water muscle looked like when it was rushing through there right and see this is just holy shit we've looked at two features now Camas Prairie and potholes cataract we could sit here for the next 10 hours looking at dozens and dozens of these mega features and you look at there's a whole bar this is a gravel bar down here over there okay see see the giant ribs on it you see those yeah I've never seen those reported in the literature it may be that nobody's ever seek really seen him before or no one's ever paid attention nobody's ever paid a tip but there they are so how what is mainstream science use to describe this this sort of or mainstream archaeology used to describe these features this would be geology well Karis an archeology yeah what would they so they believe this catastrophic flooding is I just think it's a slower I think it's lots of small catastrophic floods they're not not one not one big catastrophic flood and how what kind of timeline are these geologists putting on us Oh two or three thousand years yeah and why do they think that well because of the the ice dammed model and how much time it would take see it gets complicated and because until the comet research there was no credible source of heat that could melt that amount of ice and cause out now that's the new factor that's come into the equation now you look at look at the people standing on the cliff edge they're the edge of the rock would you see them down there yeah so now you get the sense of scale what would survive again in the aftermath not that dude something no not that dude not a dude or his buddies yeah this is a crazy place man it's crazy to look at it's just so when you were looking above it I gave in here I mean you get a sense of it but if you would just show this to me quite honestly I probably wouldn't piece that together but when you look at it the original image it's so blatantly obvious right well that's that's the thing now is we are in this position where we can we can see it and when I take people out in the field what I do is I I prep them first by showing these images from NASA the satellite photography the Google Earth imagery aerial photography then ground photography and then you go out in the landscape and at that point you can start having this framework for understanding what you're seeing otherwise you just don't the scale of it is too vast it's amazing it's really amazing this is you know this is an adventure of exploration that we're just getting launched on this is this is recovering yes recovering the lost the lost past of humanity and if I may I want to make a pitch again for the Comets for the comet research group if anybody I think it's really important it's not it's it's not just a matter of funding their research it's also a matter of sending a message that we the people are prepared to take matters into our own hands and and support those scientists who are working with open minds inquiring into the past and whether you know give a dollar or a hundred dollars or whatever any little counts it says it's the voice of the people as much as the money that really that really matters these guys the comet research group they need their research funding they have an indiegogo crowdfunding campaign you can go to my website press the comet research group banner it will take you to a page with all the relevant links please consider supporting it it's valid it's worthwhile it's worthy work and it has the potential to change the whole story of our past and our future and it's a story that would be incredibly exciting to be a part of and that's what I'm trying to get people to think look there's this thing happening and it really it is Democratic in its own way and you don't have to be some specialist or a thora particularly in some branch of academically approved science to begin to appreciate and understand this very human being getting out into the field and seeing this kind of stuff firsthand getting it into the discussion into debate and in spending more time on this because it's it's such an interesting story and that's where the scientists at the comet research group are offering that the people who contribute will participate in certain ways and this also in the future but we're all wells gays we're all human beings we're a part of this planet we are pedestrians walking along at the unlit we're being married by this planet and all this stuff is alright it's it's your right to understand what the history of this crazy Rock has gone through absolutely this is amazing yes an amazing stuff into perspective to understand this is like this for 12,000 years this story has been written into the landscape of the earth and only now are we able to step back and begin to see the big picture in in tandem with ever greater detail and what's emerging is really it's a really wild tale but the evidence is there to support it completely and this is I mean this is this is what is is the story I've told and magician's of the guns this is this is recovering this this lost memory it really is wild and our time here on this planet has been confusing for so many reasons and the one of the big ones is not not understanding how we got here and that's one of the reasons why your book I think is so important to me just give you this new perspective of how this sort of civilization emerged another problem when I think we deal with all the time is light pollution I think light pollution ever see the stone it's I think it's a really a perspective blocker in a big way no absolute absolutely is the brand old and I were having a discussion earlier about how ancient cultures related to the cosmos as above so below they felt their selves connected with the cosmos they made their monuments in alignment with key celestial bodies they did it very carefully there was a sense of bringing down the enchantment of the heavens onto onto earth in modern societies we can't even see the stars he live in the middle of the big city the stars are gone the light the light pollution just blots them out you never think they're there and you forget actually that you're part of a majestic cosmos everything about it is mystery we are immersed in mystery from the moment we're born to the moment we die and yet our society is telling us so it's all very prosaic and dull and it's just about production everything's all explained you don't really need to worry yourself about it too much because some authority somewhere has it all figured out no one has it all figured out it's not possible I think everybody owes it to themselves to go out into the desert in the middle when when you know there's a stretch where the moon is not going to be out and there's going to be clear skies especially if you live in Southern California you can get out to the desert pretty easy just get out away from all the cities and just look up and it'll freak you out it'll freak you out because it's it's one of those things that you kind of really take for granted because I'm also time the sky is just a dark black featureless thing the little couple little white dots aren't really that compelling but when you get out there and you see the actual Milky Way itself you go oh holy shit well see now we could have you know every year there's probably a dozen high-altitude events that could have been witnessed by ancient peoples that we are completely oblivious to because of our urban existence because of light pollution because nobody is really looking at the sky but these high-altitude events would be essentially equivalent to like Hiroshima sized bombs going off 20 miles up is just outside yeah it's basically like if it's in the daytime and you're not looking right up there that's right you're not going to see at a time and at night if you're living in the city if you're inside the light pollution by the time it happens it's over but if you're out in a completely wilderness area where you've got but you know visual access to the stars and you're aware of that and you're constantly aware of the presence of the sky you're going to see much more of that kind of thing happening then if the cosmos decides to get a little bit more active which it apparently does from time to time suddenly the sky is now becomes a major factor in your in your existence your tribal existence your cultural existence especially if in those episodes you have multiple fireball type events that could be on the scale of anywhere from Chelyabinsk up to tangu sky and that's what Clube and navier-- that's their scenario is these clusters of that we enter episodes of bombardment when we are passing through a filament of the torrid media stream that's thick with heavy debris asteroids of a kilometer or more in diameter when we enter those filaments we're entering a period of episodic bombardment when human civilization is at risk and according to their calculations we are entering one of those in the next 30 years Jesus and that's why we need to pay attention to this because 30 years is enough time to do something about it if we apply the resources of our civilization to this we can solve this problem let's look at a couple more pictures because I'd like to get the picture of Grahame I wonder people are too busy making new phones they don't have time to fix the asteroid thing exactly execs images and Holograms that's my my contention that it's going to take well but again those ago the serious commercial talk of mining asteroids than is that is the way into this that if they can if they can if they can see an economic return for the minute then maybe they'll do the good thing actually for the human race will this have to be a manned expedition like Bruce Willis and then asteroid movie not necessary ok what's the image that won't show well uh Jamie why don't you go to the the folder of the one we opened a folder of Awesomeness the folder for a folder the folder of Awesomeness yeah just let's start with one zero zero seven what are we gonna look at here well we're going to look at some NASA stuff how cool and then we'll look at a couple of Google Earth things and then we will look at some couple of US Geological Survey things and then we'll look at some photographs five deals worth okay let's do it we got well holy shit this is this is an early one of the early NASA photographs taken from five hundred miles up back in the late 70s actually and what we got here is the two big scab land tracts that show two of the big meltwater streams that have left their their scars in the landscape so each one of those is varies roughly between 10 and 20 miles wide and the bigger one on the right is probably 50 to 60 miles long or actually a little bit longer net but you can actually see that when the water swept down from the north out of British Columbia it washed away 200 feet roughly one to two hundred feet of the existing topsoil it had covered the basalt bedrock right basalt bedrock by the way that was originally formed by eruptions of the Yellowstone Caldera interestingly but so the water came down swept way the topsoil and left the bear dark basalt exposed down below the feature that we just looked at is not even really in this NASA photograph it's over to the west but let's go ahead to the next one Jamie with the Snake River down there which is um where's the Snake River Snake River comes up out Idaho and it joins the Columbia and then flows out to the Pacific Ocean alright then we got a Google Earth image coming up ok on order because there's just a lot there's a lot in here oh ok what tell me which number you Emil pol left we one thousand eight one zero zero eight the next one what's going on with our TV keeps going off and on that TV is not really made for the way we use it so it doesn't like the inputs and I just turned it off so I could pull up the next one okay there we go so now we're getting actually a bigger view of the landscape and you can see the two meltwater that's asked a bland tracks mm-hmm here here okay did you have what's called no one can hear you if you do this just just tell me where it is I get it okay so there's the to scab land tracks right then you've got the Grand Coulee which is that dark women going up to Columbia River there Grand Coulee Dam is right almost you almost had it it's where the Columbia River suddenly gets skinny mmm right there that's Grand Coulee Dam that's the widest the most massive concrete dam in North America and it's impounding water in Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake - about four hundred feet deep right now all of the area at the top the glacier the green mountainous area this was all covered in ice and then over to the left right there you have that brown area and do you see the kind of semicircular arc of dark ground right there yes that is where a tongue of the ice came out of Canada and it stopped right there and when it receded when it melt melted back what it did was it left all this rubble that can't really be fun armed effectively this it's called till glacial till and where the Glade where the glacier ended that's called more moraine moraine and you can see it's circular where the glacier came and then coming right off the snout of the glacier do you see kind of up a ribbony that's a giant scar in the landscape that was formed by a meltwater stream coming off of that ice sheet it's called Moses Coulee hey Randall I think we should keep in mind a lot of the audience aren't actually seeing the visuals on this they're not I mean they take the take away is that all across the Pacific Northwest is a landscape that has been utterly scarred and devastated by gigantic flood that took place 12,000 it's left its marks everywhere and this is right near coeur d'alene so coeur d'alene is from that that's the residue of this immortal Lane right yeah if people go to the Geo cosmic recs website or the sacred geometry international website they can see most of the images that we're showing well they'll see it if they watch the YouTube video they can watch it and hear you talk about it at the same time it's just the the vast majority probably 90% of our you can just leave the visuals right now but they can and so they probably will so they can go to that in watch it you can look down way down on the lower left is the potholes cataract right go up a little up along the river come down south south keep coming keep coming stop look to the right of the river that's what we were just this man does his landscapes to notice to the right to the right to the right Jamie Jamie how dare you yeah this this whole area so we we get it this all over here has been absolutely unequivocably right undeniably you see this Joe and you realize the scale of what we just looked at and now you're seeing that within this whole landscape yeah that was essentially inundated you'll start to get the scale of the thing and that's what I'm trying to do here if you Joe can get the scale of this in your mind I've accomplished something I think I got it from that one image was uh those a real mind blower both yeah the rippers yeah the well the ripples were real mind blower and then the other one with the farmland and then this massive channel cut into it you kind of get it yeah um the ripples aren't even on this image they're their way to the east has anybody sat down with you and tried to dispute this I mean the people that believe that this was a slow and gradual effect does anybody sat down and tried to debate you on this no this seems like something that would be really interesting to debate I mean I would love to see someone who's a geologist that you know that I'm sure there's someone out there that is listening to this that may have a dispute with it that there is I'm sure but I would love to I would love to see them talk to you about it and go over all the various things the nuclear glass that they find the I mean all of it all the tops like here's the thing Joe at this point nobody is connecting the work of the of the comet research group with the Missoula flood effects that we're looking or arrests except up except us yeah that's crazy most people are like that's crazy how is it possible because it's a missing lady it's it's such an obvious it's such an obvious connection and it really merits sex she scares the shit out of me what if you guys didn't exist what if you guys were never born what if you never wrote that book what if you never been freaking out about this shit your whole life how would I know how many times in the in the human story as this happened yeah where stuff has just not been explored that really needed to that sounds crazy to something like a Michael Shermer a skeptical person well I'd say to Michael Shermer come on man let's go spend a week out in that landscape well he does wanted to bait you he wants to sit down debate you Graham all right let's can we set that up we can set that up I would love it yeah yeah that's how that sounds that sounds like yes it would be a good time yeah well in my mind there's really no no arguing with with this this evidence I mean well it's too overwhelming and the question really comes down to at this point nobody disputes that there were catastrophic floods the question is what was the mechanism how many were there how long and so long how long did it take was it a bunch of catastrophic but smaller floods or was it back to Brett TSA's original model of one giant flood and I think the truth actually lies somewhere between the two and and again the geology gets complicated but I'm writing it up so I will explain in detail what my thoughts aren't after after having criss-crossed thousands of miles of this landscape heatedly and basically absorbed every piece of scientific literature every written on it I've evolved some ideas about what could have happened here and how it happened well I was a grown adult and I found out that North America most of it was by you know what was it ten twelve thousand years ago was covered by a mile-high sheet of ice I was yes thought I was a grown adult in a way no America roughly north of Minneapolis yeah yeah and that was that's common knowledge right I mean everybody knew that anybody who's actually studied the history of it but it never made it to my dopey head until I was a grown adult and then I went wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute what and the the idea in my mind that this whole thing was covered just 12,000 years ago that seems so incredibly recent by the way that ice was more like two miles deep could consider the weight of those ice masses pressing down I mean anything that was there before the ice came down with it being ground to powder and then as the ice cataclysmic melts everything below it is washed away forever it's like an eraser for the world iterate see that's exactly that's a great phrase and eraser for the world and that is the thing that so many of the skeptics haven't factored into their thinking when you're going whoa where's the evidence yeah the evidence is you've got to understand is that we have to rethink the possibility of evidence once we know that there has been these erasers of the world that have been transpired and not just once but I mean what we're looking at here is probably the most severe events in the last five million years and I have a reason for using that number five million what's the reason well the reason is is based upon the the the severity of the mass extinction we have to go back five million years to find an extinction event of an equivalent level as what occurred at the Younger Dryas it's funny because what I would call a knee-jerk sceptical person would always say that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence is there anything more extraordinary than that image of those farmlands and that giant swath cut into the land that's that is the extraordinary that is it yes that that's very right pretty extraordinary and then the core samples the core samples that show this massive fluctuation of temperature yeah yeah that yeah in prekow that coincides with the mountainsides yes yes it's all there is it obviously all leads even if someone like me it leads to an event and this cataclysmic episode immediately precedes the time when we've been told that civilization began yeah that's the other point which is really important we have this huge punctuation mark and then civilization suddenly starts to evolve know it was there before this is a reinvention those hunter-gatherers like those people that you would watch one of those shows or they survive in Alaska you watch those shows yes this shows a great like life below zero is crazy asshole yeah yeah those people would make it those people would make it and they would breed and they would carry on yeah yeah what is that was it's a 1012 oh you could just say it next to me I don't want to interrupt you Joe no worries no worries look at this Wow okay so that to me I'm looking at this after what you've told me that looks like water that is sort of like receded and left these lines in the Silcock way think think of a bathtub ring after Joe you get in here and you take a bath and the water is basically brown with sediment when it has up the clock is away daddy you take a tub rings you leave in sediment your tub a man have you're quoting Genesis and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high hills were covered Wow not because I'm you know trying to pump the biblical flood model either far from it what I am trying to drop in pictures whenever I realize here's a great quote and it doesn't matter where it's from because there's so many flood legend you can quote from well the political flood model is the it is one of those myths is one of those traditions that have come to one of thousands of traditions that's think of this the whole ancestral memory of the human race is telling us that something terrible happened it's it's also very unfortunate that's all that's all connected with an ideology that a lot of people find problematic like that there's this issues with that being you know religion of course cult or this faith-based beliefs we must immediately realized the flood is not the property of the monotheistic religion because itís found was there in every culture on it also in that a lot of these stories you're talking about massive translations from ancient Hebrew to Latin to Greek and a lot is lost in the process and you're dealing with a lot of these stories were handed down from generation and generation for like what was it like a thousand years before the first version was ever rip salutely absolutely so all that's I mean that is unbelievably fascinating go to 1014 one zero one four and we'll see a topographic map yeah whoa now that you know trifles it's like it's crazy looks like something just what like you had a sand castle or some flats and set up and a wave came in and cut through it and then pulled back the wave came from the north and it swept down over the landscape and basically carved and plucked and quarried and gouged and gashed that landscape and this is one of the places Graham and I went if you look right in there you'll see where it says Grand part of Grand Coulee gr a nd right there with the D is we have a great video clip online of me and grey and we're looking at the this actual topo map right here and then surveying the the cataract around us you'll also notice that there's a rock blade just like similar to the one that we just saw in the drone footage in the rock lay human and you recognize the alcoves now yeah and if we go to the next one we have a Google Earth image of 1015 of this feature and there's the Google Earth image and for scale in the upper left hand I've superimposed Niagara Falls at the same scale so you can see by comparison Wow if you see men deny or Falls Jill I did I went when I was a little kid I honestly don't remember I think I went when I was a little kid I have to check with my mom it's impressive you see it but you the point here is that anybody looking at this and you know if the folks look at the the imagery on the online lays out one of the biggest waterfalls in the world one Niagara yeah not in terms of volume no wa naze of the african or something yeah or South American maybe Victoria Falls it depends you know the highest are the greatest volumes is about 200 and between 150 and 200 thousand cubic feet per second going over those Falls depending on the flow of the river but the flow that came through here was about 350 million cubic feet per second and left this and yeah for going lying on the Geo cosmic wrecks website there's a video clip of me and Graham down there just just by perch Lake may I ask you a question here yeah now if the water that was creating Grand Canyon or the Niagara Falls rather right up there if that all receded and we could see the bottom wouldn't it look similar to what you see in here the one of Grand Canyon no excuse me not with a dagger Falls right there right above it right there yes it would but on a smaller scale on a smaller scale but like on a smaller scale like some of the smaller features that you see right there right yeah and that's the thing you were saying or it's fractal the interesting thing about water erosion and sedimentation is it's scale invariant so you can look at features and coming up into pictures here I've got a beautiful example of scale invariance where you see the small version in the large version and it's exactly the same thing that's why if you go into any geology text they've always got something in the photographs like a a rock pic or a person standing there otherwise it's hard to get a sense of the scale of what you're looking at right so my question though was that if that's the case if you could drain Niagara Falls and it would have a similar feature set to what you're seeing on the ground there well we know that Niagara Falls has been doing that for a long long time about a thousand years of work of the river at Niagara Falls right here you're looking at a moment in time that unfold it in a few weeks right but how do we know that well for one thing to scale of it because if it because in other words how long would it take Niagara to carve something on this scale if it's taken Niagara 10,000 years say to carve that how long would it take an equivalent flow to carve this but it would never look like if you drained it though what would it look like an equivalent to any of these things for you well right here for one thing it's not basalt bedrock so you're not going to see quite the same type of erosion because really what you what you've got to consider is that all different rock types are Road differently right also you know what happens is you have teams of flow so that what you have in Niagara today is a lower flow regime which doesn't have anywhere near the type of turbulence or erosive potential is when you get water moving at 50 or 60 miles an hour one reason we definitely can know that this is the case is because we see the association with the giant current ripples we see the boulders that have been plucked and quarried and some of them are 40 and 50 feet in diameter you see and we'll look at some of those coming up in the next next picture do you have that image that you were talking about before of that one gigantic boulder that was carried on this it's coming up out if we move quickly through here will will get to it so go to go to 1017 and that'll be from the ground view again with Niagara Falls superimposed for scale the Horseshoe Falls the Canadian Falls superimposed for scale now basically that cataract at Horseshoe Falls is about 120 feet in height the cliff wall of this giant cataract is about 400 feet high and then you see the beginning of the blade rock out there and the full extent of the thing actually goes all the way to the horizon but we can't see that beyond there but this erosion goes all the way to the horizon to stone that cut into basalt hard columnar basalt god that was extruded basically with the eruption of the Yellowstone Caldera long 15 million years ago basically but then covered up by a couple of hundred feet of topsoil and then that was exposed when the floods came through go to the next 1018 and you'll see an example of some of the debris that was left behind by the floodwaters when they finally ceased there's the stuff that you're looking at now the bigger stuff there is 30 and 40 feet those would be like four-story buildings down there so those are just washed away by this gigantic river that's just this this right this massive gigantic river moving 50 60 miles an hour sweeps through there plucks and Aires the bedrock and then when the spigots finally get turned off the water starts subsiding and this stuff that's being carried in there just gets left in the wake just like you're going to see any modern smaller flood is going to leave material in its wake the difference is this material is piles of boulders the size of houses gravel bars two and three hundred feet thick and three miles long and they're all in it so see here's the answer to your question is and this is what how Brett's finally did it was by showing that it was the full suite of evidence taken integrally that created a picture that was undeniable to the skeptics it was just it was overwhelming because it was every piece fit together too perfectly to ignores no other explanation other than gigantic hydraulic events and and now it's a question of the detail what caused them how long did it take and you know that's where the controversy is now this is amazing it's amazing and terrifying but what's cool about is it's terrifying but everything's ok right now everything is ok right now so it's well it's like you feel like a be fine but maybe not if something like this happens again well you have to ask what what could be the change in you know in the human orientation to life on this planet like for example I remember the first Earth Day 1970 right when when this consciousness about hey you know what our existence on this planet is having an effect on this planet right and at that point you see this a whole environmental consciousness emerge that didn't exist before that right well I think maybe in the next decade or two we're going to see a new environmental consciousness that involves the recognition that this planet we live on is a very dynamic place and has been so it is the key to deciphering a lot of mysteries geological cultural historical and and paleontological biological etc that that this has been a dominant factor in the evolution of basically everything that's been going on on this planet whether you're looking at millions of years or thousands of years it's just it's such a strange time to be alive where all this stuff is coming together all this information is being exposed and it's as well there's no hidden archive has young has been broken open and the stuff is spilling out you don't know whether you've opened Pandora's box by letting it out but it's all logical a little large it's so easy to follow it's all I mean it seems like when it comes to like a step by step to 1 0 to 9 coming up 1 0 to 9 1 felt like I'm a bingo guy now this one we traveled about 500 miles south out onto the Utah Canyon it's beautiful and what you're seeing there is basically dry cataracts now that you've seen these cataracts you can begin to recognize them all over the place now this has not been acknowledged as being a cataract but what you actually see when you look at the modern erosion is that these features are being slowly eroded and eaten away by the modern erosion and it's a different erosional regime altogether that creates features like this and this is a vast scale of erosion here and when you travel over the southwest that is the most striking thing that you're going to experience if you're if you're you know in empathic with the landscape which is that there's been this enormous amount of erosion now I'm not saying that this enormous amount of erosion was all created by one flood but I think what it is possibly saying is that when we go back over several million years gigantic floods on this scale aren't and that exceptional that there's something that from time to time and see here's the thing this is completely removed from the glaciers any water that would have eroded this landscape was not coming from the glaciers it had to have been coming from rainfall go if you go to the next slide Jamie one thought which is not it is not a disconnected element because because of the massive rain out that was that resulted from the impacts on the ice cap what's this this is Valles Caldera this is the largest volcanic caldera in North America oh it's 11 miles across and here's what it was born out of a catastrophe millions of years ago right and then subsequent eruptions over hundreds of thousands of years have left this feature but what's interesting to us here is what happened around 12,000 years ago the entire caldera filled up suddenly and if you look at right about if you look at it as a clock at about 8 o'clock you can see a breach of Valley coming off you see that you know Jamie can you yeah right there that was the spillover so at the same time now get this at the same window of time that this these flood events are happening up in Washington and Idaho and Montana this caldera suddenly fills up with water and the water spills over the rim and cuts a canyon hundreds of feet deep now what could cause that to suddenly fill up with water and it's completely removed it's not receiving glacial meltwater there's only one thing by default and that would be rainfall a lot of rainfall falling over days and days at a time so if you go to the next slide we'll see what sits down in the bottom of this valley is thousands of these gigantic rolled boulders and you know that their water transported because they're round they're rolled that's what water does it rolls these things now this is in New Mexico see so this is related to the spillway the overflow of all its caldera which has been dated to that same interval when the floods were happening up north the same interval that now the comet is dating to is this coincidence or are the two related I would say it would be very premature to dismiss it and say that they're not related to that because as Graham just said one of the ones that one of the consequences of an impact whether it's in to the ocean or the ice sheet is you're going to have extreme amounts of water vapor injected catastrophic ly into the atmosphere which is then going to rain out in in incredible torrential downpours that might last for days at a time and along with that water vapor is a tremendous amount of particulate mass and it's that rain out that I would say caused the erosion on the Sphinx and tells us that the Sphinx is 12,000 years old not 2500 BC you guys are freaking me out this is amazing this is the most convincing argument yet that you guys have ever made it's all it's all been convinced this is this is more compelling and and then it all the pieces let's go them together ya know the next slide Jamie which would be 1032 which is to me a beautiful example of scale and variance Wow here we have the modern snake river flowing in the modern Channel and then we have the ancient flood channel and which you can see there the average annual discharge of the snake fifty six thousand nine hundred cubic feet but the estimated flood that created the big channel is 40 million cubic feet and now this flood actually was coming up get this out of Utah it was coming up it was part of the giant Lake Bonneville of which the Great Salt Lake is but a diminutive remnant so the Bonneville Salt Flats the Bonneville Salt Flats were the bottom of this gigantic lake that that filled the basins of northeastern Utah and at the end of the last ice age it suddenly filled up very rapidly and spilled over a mountain pass to the north and then flooded the South the Snake River plain of southern Idaho and anybody can see the Snake River plain if you go to Google Earth or any topographic map and it cut channels like this that ultimately led to the Columbia River but interestingly the dating of this puts it again right in that window so that window of twelve thousand eight hundred to eleven thousand six hundred years ago when everything changes yes everything changes and so what I'm showing you is just a little bit selecting random almost dots to show you that no matter where you look you're going to see evidence of these of these events imprinted into the landscape yeah go to the next slide 1033 and if you go down and you stand on that floodplain down there you'll see the kind of stuff that got left behind this is the sediment load being carried in the flood Wow so you got what kind of powerful currents are necessary to transport and I'm standing in the canyon that was cut by the flood those walls are 400 feet high so what we would think of as being like little pebbles at the bottom of a stream gets moved around yes nice grand scale this is like sand grains on the bottom of a modern little creek but or River said that humongous boulders yes and this is what a geologist or geomorphologist would call the bedload the stuff being swept along in in the flood waters be rolled and tumble and geologists recognize this but they think took mainstream geologists think it took along no I mean did the few geological lepers that have been written on this admit that it was a one big catastrophic flood Wow and what is their explanation for that catastrophic flood well that somehow Lake Bonneville rose up and and something right breached a pass and its northern rim but you know is that possible in any way well yeah if you have enough rainfall prolonged over a period of time days or weeks that the whole body water could have raised by 300 feet roughly and then it bet you again you would need something like the comet impact to provide you with a source for that rainfall right because otherwise there's no other explanation for that ever that kind of rainfall and it's known from the modeling of oceanic impacts that yes there would be unbelievable rain out in the aftermath of an oceanic impact and clearly the same thing would follow in the wake of an ice impact what oceanic impacts we have on record only a few of them armed there's one up by Sweden we were discussing also the possible Indian Ocean impact possibly one in the Indian Ocean 5,000 years ago which which creates tsunamis on both sides of the Indian Ocean dated - a massive massive tsunami disposal deposits and again the this whole argument of the Younger Dryas cataclysm between twelve thousand eight hundred and eleven thousand six hundred years ago the strongest case is the the focus of the science has been on twelve thousand eight hundred years ago but there's a lot of interest in the eleven thousand six hundred years ago as well and the strongest suggestion of what caused that that sudden rise in temperatures are come need by meltwater pulse well one B was a second encounter with more fragments of the debris of the comet this time the impacts not being on the North American ice camp but in a major ocean probably the Pacific and that that then puts a huge plume of water vapor into the upper atmosphere and shrouds the earth and creates the greenhouse effect that accounts for the radical rise in temperature that occurred eleven thousand six hundred years ago more science needs to be done on that it's another reason why I want to see the comet research group funded because this is this is important work guide Amazon awesome podcast mmm this might be my all-time favorite yeah okay we'll talk about half a dozen more key yeah for sure let's roll okay one thousand and thirty nine and this is here now you'll be able to see actually a person in the in the field of view next to one a giant current ripple and there's a giant that's a giant current ripple field we did see this one green this is the West bar very cool yes if you go back one slide we can see an aerial photo I took years ago of West bar it's three miles long there it is whoa and there's an airport down the lighter-colored buffs of is a landing strip and the the airport building there is three stories tall so this whole feature is three miles long and the ripples here are on the same scale as the Camas Prairie ripples that we just looked at of course this is in Central Washington the other one was in Montana so again you as we begin to place these event nodes around on the map we can begin to see the outlines of a really really huge event and all of this is going on at the same time you've sort of this is dated at the same time all this is dated to the same time that you think the impact took place and it's all over that coast the only dates that we have that our hard dates are a volcanic ash primarily from Mount st. Helens the date at 13,000 years but they use that as a baseline and then assume the there was multiple floods and each flood was separated by fifty to a hundred years and what they've done is they've gone from Rex's original model of a single flood into a dozen floods into forty floods and now up to 80 or 90 floods which I disagree with but on the other hand there were see I think you have to understand this in two phases because the anit impact phase is going to melt a whole lot of ice all of a sudden but it's not going to melt all of it it's going to leave a huge amount of residual ice in the aftermath now what we see is that particularly after the 11,600 year-ago event at that point the whole planet comes right out of the Ice Age inexplicable s the end of the ice that's the end of the Ice Age the beginning of the Holocene it's over and and basically what we're seeing here is that there is a great deal of heat suddenly that's brought the planet out of the icy it does not convert revert back into the Ice Age like it did it to 12,900 event C so what we then have is that in the aftermath of this event the whole climate of the earth has been completely altered the whole balance of nature has been completely altered from before these events to after these events but what you have now is a lot of residual ice that takes about two or three thousand years to melt away so sea levels continue to rise sea levels continue to rise and the melting of this ice produces some pretty big floods but not on the scale of what we're looking at here and I think it's my personal opinion that there's a confusion between the two different flood regimes and I'm going to document all I'm writing all this up in detail as a like as a thesis to explain my interpretation of the phenomena over you know 20 years but let's go to that would be so important I would love to see people really go over this with a fine-tooth comb because it's so compelling she's so amazing like just this image itself is just wow what would what kind of power and force would it take to create those ripples those 50 foot high ripples all over the place miles and miles and miles of the yeah and and see nothing since that event has really affected them they're still sitting there's these gigantic monstrous fossil features in the landscape now when they do core samples on that stuff what do they find out like as far as the dating of it like if they get bottom one of those ripples well you've got to find a lot you've got to be able to find organic material right in there and to the extent that there's organic material it basically all dates from the end of the Ice Age the problem is is when you have a flood like this coming through it's sweeping up everything in its path including forests and animals so if you've got a bone in there or a piece of wood that doesn't necessarily mean when the flood happened right it's not a nice layer of said layers of sediment it's a jumble yeah messed up kij chaotic mess it's not like you could just go dig into the side of that hill at that same level and find something that's organic and absolutely dated to that because that's all stone right right it's boulders it is if you saw a cross-section of one of those ripples it's it's just a jumbled chaotic mess of everything from finest sand and silt up to boulders the size of cars and even houses and stuff just yeah that's so crazy go to 10:41 and we'll see an interesting artist rendition by edward Riau who did all the illustrations for the jewels original Jules Verne books and he did a version for Anna straw straw geology text was the guy's name is skipping me right now but I thought it was an interesting image because it basically shows an event on the scale of what we're talking about and what's interesting here is you see that the torrents are carrying icebergs and in this one iceberg in the foreground I call it grams rock from now on it's going to be I have officially turned aimed at graves it's carrying it I can get one dress I or we're talking about it it's now it's grams yeah because I went and climbed that it's no longer the Wenatchee erratic rush is the grammar addict I'm on a drive thank you okay so we got the grammar addict coming up in about three images so let's go to the next one ten forty two and this is basically another key piece of evidence is strewn for thousands of square miles throughout the out of the flood you have these gigantic boulders and these are being carried aboard icebergs let me let me describe what we're looking at right now because as a person is that you there I took the picture so it's two of my fellow travelers okay normal sized people and you know whatever six feet tall and and bounce them on top of each other 12:18 you're looking at probably at least 35 40 feet tall right now yeah and and wider wider than it is tall oh yeah 60 feet wide does that's insane and that was carried by water it was carried it was carried on icebergs yeah in the water oh my god so this one this flood is not just water it's it's a huge thousands of icebergs it's forests up by their boots it's a jumbling massive powerful erosive flow amazing thousands of megafauna are done doubt in fact a lot of the there have been a lot of mammoth remains found in missoula flood sediments they're generally in the Willamette Valley okay let's go to the next image there we go this is I like out in the middle of the Prairie again you got thousands of these things I'll tell you what I'm a chicken I wouldn't stand right there I think that thing's gonna roll on top of you that would be a wrap son yeah this is known as Yeager raw that thing's huge and is that you want to eat there no that's one of my try took the pictures tell him stand there yeah I said stand there and I had the other guys go around the back Rock Bush I this thing is kind of hanging off the side of that hill the way some of those Hollywood Hills houses are uh-huh on stilts see that that that rounded mass of stuff that it's sitting in is called a Berg Mound and you see these icebergs are not clean ice they're dirty they're filled with gravel and debris so in a Berg when a Berg that's being carried in the flood and the floodwaters subside the Berg's get stranded in the land they then melt and if there's no Boulder there's just a mound if there's no gigantic Boulder there's just a mound but if there is a gigantic Boulder being carried aboard the iceberg it will be sitting in a berg mound like you see right that's amazing so that white line that we see was where the iceberg was when it deposited that thing than it just melted from there no that's actually a bedding plane between two different kinds of basalt so okay so the mound itself below it is what you're saying is the burgh mound that's the Berg Mountain and the boulder the big boulder was the cargo sitting on top of the iceberg okay so the Berg is not just water it's water with a bunch of dirt and all kinds of other shit in as well yeah and so when it melts that's what it leaves behind it leaves bhai that's amazing okay in the next image we have the hancock array that you up there well that's me on top of that back in the eighteen thousand tunnel there once you bryggen walk yeah I was I do that from time to time but it but it it's an amazing experience to stand there and to think what transported this well we know it was transported in an iceberg and it was dumped there on the side of that Valley and it's just the thought of thousands of these things plowing along at 60 or 70 miles an hour carried on a gigantic flood how do we have anything left you know no wonder no wonder we've forgotten our past and say and here's the thing I mean what we're doing here is we're looking where these flood events are preserved the most spectacularly and the reason is is because you had a very steep gradient from the ice sheet elevation to the Pacific Ocean but like Graham and I when we traveled across we traveled across the Continental Divide and traveled from the Rocky Mountains to the Twin Cities which is on the Mississippi River and all the way across we were caught crossing huge meltwater Cooley's we crossed the Missouri River Valley which is an under fit stream just very similar to the snake where the modern Missouri is just a little ribbon of river occupying this massive meltwater channel of which there are hundreds across the plains and then when we got to Minneapolis we went up and we visited some of the larger known PHA mazing potholes we go again you're looking on the scale of giants this is this is beyond imagination what you look at and and the only this the flood explanation makes sense of it go to go to 1:05 for Jamie and you'll see there we go I'm down inside the pothole one of the potholes hanging up at gram so that's a pothole carved into stone by whirlpool yeah picking up rocks in them and the rock said the erosive agent that's cutting out the pothole just think like a massive hydraulic drill Wow just picking up you know coarse rock and then just good drilling literally drilling holes 50 60 80 feet deep again go to the YouTube please if you're listening to this just go just you gotta fast forward to this this is insane this image is insane just thinking of watching rocks spin around now reeling into the ground and you're talking about over a short period of time oh yeah probably you know I'm guessing you know these giant meltwater floods this is right along the st. Croix River which forms the border between Minnesota and Wisconsin it was probably of several weeks duration as its peaked at its peak and so the drilling of the bedrock probably was accomplished within that time span what I wouldn't give to know what that was like just to see it well you'd have had to be in an orbit to survive it right yeah even if you're flying over in a plane probably they're just the atmospheric change this is on top of these flood sediments from I've documented it from Ohio to Washington State there are thick layers of loss now Loess is this strange topsoil that came down and it's they've been arguing for generations is it when deposited or water deposited but the curious thing is it seems to be both wind and water deposited but I think the obvious explanation for it is this that when you see the like the top layers of the flood sediments particularly in the back flood regions where the where the water was calm or rather than so torrential you see these layers these beautiful they're called rhythmites they're very rhythmical on top of that is a layer of this lost topsoil with this vertical structure right well to me and again without getting into the technical background I think the logical explanation and most likely explanation is that at the tail end of the the final flood flows what you're seeing is is a rainfall of mud and this rainfall of mud came down and which many ancient traditions speak of yes black bituminous rain mud falling from the sky darkness a time of darkness it's all described in the myth myths are the memory banks of humanity we should not call the myths we should call them memories yeah exactly and again this this muddy rainfall perfectly fits the whole narrative and yeah with the mythology it's it's right there when we think of these the the idea of these tsunamis we think of water that you can see we're most likely dealing with the entire air around you filled with a rental downpour and solid matter everything's flying through the air slurry incredible winds incredible winds yes so it's both wind and water and just full-on chaos super hurricanes its nature gone chaotic and crazy on ultimate steroids wow this is what it's so wild and it's real that's the thing this time while people were alive oh yeah and after a while people were alive absolutely it's not a dinosaur thing no it happened a blink of an eye ago it happened it happened when anatomically modern humans had already been around for two hundred thousand years writing well no they but not according to the Orthodox historians but if we're dealing with a lost civilization which I believe to be the case then yes it's totally totally makes sense mmm completely totally makes sense yeah and it's time it's time to get to grips with this it's time to move move forward to the next level and start recovering our memory yeah we also start recognizing this is this is a potential reality yeah this is a not just the past this is very possible and and again if I may say so crowdfunding it's the opportunity for the people to give their voice show can you show that page this is the the crowdfunding page for the comet research group and it's on in the link is on Graham hanger there it is so if you go to Graham Hancock comm and click on the comet research group banner then you'll you'll get taken immediately to the crowdfunding page please support it whatever you can give it'll make all the difference it sends a message that we that we care about alternative heretical research and also while you're at my website
