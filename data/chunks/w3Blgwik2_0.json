hello freak bitches most of the time it's bet they can make most of the times with the lead leg and they don't step open the right foot so the angle cannot go like a 90-degree angle into the muscle and it kicks straight up and because look look if everybody who gets kicked to the pills I guarantee you the leg that they're standing on the toes are pointing forwards if they were point to the side it will be okay well with check I believe it was knees in the clinch oh I think it was just right sure yeah a Thai boxer should know that I never need anybody until I did once actually but that was on purpose you know I if I could fight video from that that is the best doula so I fight Renee Rosie you heard about it right the tall guy from all the total psychopath they say and it does always illegal thing so we're fighting him and I'm the first rider I beat the crap out of him in the second round would come out and we're clinching and he bites in my ear I'm shouting let go my let go let go and then you see my knee going all the way back and then I named as he comes loose from the ground that's all I need in the pills he goes down and I wanted to attack him on the ground but they pull me off and then Cora hammers was in my corner now he brought all his friends he was like he had Hells Angels with him and and I had all my bouncers friends with me and they all started fighting they threw they threw a chair into the ring it bounced off Cora hammers back it lands behind me if you see the video man it lands behind me I look behind me I see the chair I sit in the chair while I watch everybody fighting and that later they cleared everybody everybody throws down because the referee took he says why did you do it I said look at my ear and it was a hole straight through my ear he bit straight through my ear a hold in there and then he grabbed a microphone and he announced to everybody though he's got a hold in his ear he bit his ear that's why you did and then everybody calm down continue the fight no that was the idea well we live twice as long as our ancestors did a century ago you know yeah that's true but really no one's living above 120 just more and more people are pushing up to the upper ceiling because of public health and just general stuff we do that makes us healthier but in terms of longevity and aging you can't stop it all you can do is kind of you hopefully slow it down a little bit and and you want to have a higher quality life the further up you go as opposed to lying in bed in with tubes for the last 10 years of your life or something like that so that's where the future researches where the breakthroughs will come not not radical life extension is that I've also written about you know we all have 500 years Shurmur don't you want to live 500 years like look just get me to 90 without Alzheimer's and cancer okay let's just start one decade at a time it's just easy yeah you know because you know the problems are really complex well this I think the quality of life thing used mentioned is one of the most important things like we are I have this phrase that I've said many times but I'm gonna say because it fits right here we all love to sleep but everyone's afraid to die we love to shut off we'd love to shut off at night everybody loves it and we look forward to it but that one big shut off when you're not coming back is just too fucked up it's just too much well it's inevitable this is my my next book I have a chapter called afterlife for atheists so these are not just the radical life extension is but to Pete the mine uploaders and and so you know you're gonna scan your connectome put it in a computer and then you know you'll wake up in the computer like Johnny Depp in that right here's the problem when you go to sleep when you wake up tomorrow maybe you're groggy for a few minutes but yeah then you're you're back you still feel like you there's a continuity between today and tomorrow or you get general anesthesia surgery you wake up you're groggy ER for a little bit longer but the continuity comes back it's still you so a question is is if you're you die and we have a scan of your connectome and we put it in a computer and turn it on are you gonna wake up in the computer like you did from sleep and I don't think so I think it would just be a copy of your if this could ever be done which is very unlikely because it's super hard problem but let's just say I could I I think there's a break in continuity from death you're dead that's it and this thing we have is a copy of you it would be like if we cloned your body and then you die and then we reconstruct the body and there you are that's not you not first person through the eyes me it's just a copy of me I've always had this rose-colored view of us and I acknowledge that it's a myth but I always look at the myth of America as I call it the 1950's high school textbook view of America that to me is what I want to move towards so when they talk about creating a more perfect union that to me is the goal and anything that conflicts with that self-image to me is the problem so when you see sometimes how we really operate anything Dick Cheney does I'm all right and I don't use the word evil so I'll use the word into far√≠as Dick Cheney is to me when you say what do you want to avoid in this country I want to avoid where Dick Cheney wants us to go because nothing conflicts with my 1950s mythological American textbook idea then what Cheney wants us to be and when you look at some of the things we've done some of the things based on that 1947-1948 America which we thought okay we have to do everything to stop global communism they're gonna take over the country once you look at some of the things we did and you realize some of what we're dealing with today is blowback you don't know how to undo that I mean you almost think it's like permanent damage look at the way some in the Middle East see us I mean I'll talk to people like I remember talking to Sam Harris about this and he was talking about what you have to see things this certain way and I said yes but that's not gonna help you solve the problem how do you solve the problem if we've already if we've already soiled our beds so much that you don't know how to fix that you don't know how to go and say listen we're sorry about this can we start from scratch you can't do that in foreign affairs just like you can't do it with the mainframe computer that is the government you know I can't figure out how to had a reverse course to a point where we can once again fix stuff right it's it's too damaged I think it just has to dry out slowly but surely look all the wounds of the past have to heal up and dry out and it just takes time but how to use me right we've already made enough people mad at us so that they're after us well now we have to go protect ourselves by going and getting them so we perpetuate the cycle like I can't figure out how to jump off the merry-go-round you know what I mean I don't think it moves that way I think we're trying to make a battleship move like a race car and I just think it takes a long time to shift course and when we're looking at these people that are in the Middle East that are opposing the US right now and angry and want to attack the US right now you're most likely never going to get to them you might get to their grandchildren and I think that might be the only way things slowly but surely settled down and that's the argument for the NSA and the CIA to continue to monitor things that are really kind of ridiculous and invasive level because there's so many people out there that hate us or hate the government and hate the military and hate what's happened to them and so many martyrs are created every time a drummer I was gonna go how do you how do you how do you get that next generation to not hate us when we're busy killing their parents because their parents want to kill us I mean that's the cycle and I can't figure out how to break the cycle right now but how do you protect ourselves from their anti-american parents in a way that doesn't turn them against us too does that make sense
