hello freak bitches I want queefs I don't break for queefs you don't like your fucking girl and you hear that and they sort of want to stop yeah fucking that's like I'm driving down the highway someone goes hey okay let me ask you this do you pussy when they're on their period uh I used to but as I got older no hmm I don't give a fuck I used to fuck chicks with Shane a lot and how dare you we would accidentally touch dicks sometimes like one time I was it like that operation game I thought I was fucking a girl in her ass and it went into her cunt and actually went into his condom inside I'm looking down at how loose is his con what is it a fucking trash bag I was harder than make sense at least resistance so I'm looking down at minute don't line up I swear to god I've got inside his condom yep so using the Collin never sees me about the container so that you guys could rub dicks together that wasn't the plan but I was I was like I'm fucking his bitch's ass and I look down and I see an asshole and I'm like how many assholes is this gonna have I'm in at least one of them and then I reach down and I feel a condom how drunk were you guys not drunk at all well how did you not know where you're putting your dick don't you look what are you looking at oh you're on the ass you're pushing and pushing and pushing and then you sort of feel and then it slipped yeah so you go oh that must have gone in the a hole the one that was pushing a girl doing the whole time invasion of the body snatchers yeah she's got to Dixon and vagina she's fucking Oh Buster listen she was from Malta I hate to wrap this up on a high note like that pull we're out of time so anyway I've reached down I go I didn't have a condom on I have a condom on and then I pull out my busting out on her butt and people go what you touched a dick but when you're doing that kind of stuff it's like two mobsters digging a hole for a body and their shovels clink you don't fucking care you're at work right I understand I saw why'd you wrap that up nice and tight do you know I had a revelation the other day when it came to movies I want to see the Martian it's pretty good interesting but it's problem is the problem with that movie is you know he's gonna live you know he's gonna make it so it's like someone gave you a spoiler alert before you even got to the movie it's like oh is he gonna die on Mars am i paying money to watch two hours of him and he's gonna die on Mars get the fuck out of here everybody knows he's not gonna die on Mars but the revelation was there's there's too many movies and like even really awesome movies like Sicario supposed to be pretty badass because man that's the new Benicio del Toro movie it's supposed to be pretty badass but we couldn't get a ticket to that one in time we was sold out so we went with the Martian but the point is these movies never stop every week there's new ones and they don't go away like the old ones don't stop being around like you can go watch them too it's like there's too many of them like I was thinking about all the different movies just on iTunes and Netflix and I was scrolling through them and I started thinking like this is it this is a never-ending equation like it just keeps getting tacked on to it we live in the epicenter of where it's created it's all around here and it's it's very strange because the body of work just never stops like it used to be when I was a kid when a good movie came out you would go to see that fucking movie like Star Wars I saw Star Wars 13 times and I was nothing compared to the real geeks like there's it was like it was a big deal back then to see how many times you could see a movie like you couldn't run a movie long enough to see for someone to see it 13 times now because there's new ones there's new ones come in we got to get this fucking piece of shit out of theater you would never have a movie like Star Wars that played it over and over and over and over and over and over again and if Star Wars came out today people would shit right in its mouth it's it's weird that is to me in my childhood one of the greatest movies of all time when I was a kid and that movie came out I remember when obi-wan Kenobi was talking to Luke Skywalker and they were in the sand I was like this is the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life this is amazing this guy's in space and he's gonna obi-wan Kenobi's gonna teach him how to be a Jedi the greatest movie ever I remember it couldn't been more perfect I'm ever seeing that movie and thinking this movie is fucking perfect now you go watch and you're like oh my god it's such a clunky turd it's clunky the special effects look like shit why is Darth Vader evil does he does not even a reason why he's evil he's just evil what does he get when he takes over the world does he even get pussy is even gonna get any pussy in space you know he's just building some giant star that can blow up planets really this is so dumb like it's so dumb Oh uses the dark side oh not the dark side it's so fucking dumb and it's puppets it's like Kermit the Frog Skywalker but in this day like if you judge it in the context of its day it's one of the all-time classic films it's just there's so many more now and they're better they say you are a fighter for example you got an opponent but this time the opponent is yourself and and you know it from the inside and you feel it from the inside and it makes you happy it makes you strong and makes you healthy and this is what we have lost from there in nature and now it's back so so in a sense what you've done is you tapped into something extremely primal by dealing with one of the most primal elements at all of all that was cold yes so the coal like in the vice documentary I thought it was really fascinating you said cold is your god yes it is yeah if I had a teacher I've never had a teacher that's that's amazing and no guru or mentor or Sai foo or anything like that the cold that's my teacher that's my god I've been dodging the cult and says a little kid it's amazing you just felt compelled to jump into that yes and what was when you're saying this to people when you're 31 years old and you're telling people I can control my immune system there must have been like you're out of your fucking mind look at this guy's jump it in the freezing water and he says he can control the immune system how did you convince people to the point that you got actual scientists to measure your blood do legitimate scientific studies on you like what was it your accomplishments like you went for people I don't know you did a bunch of really unbelievable tasks you you climbed Everest in your shorts did you have shoes on when you climbed Everest yes I had to with spikes spikes right and I know children it's I think I go by clothes it's insane because it's like you're not challenging nature you can go up with about a with a car as well mm-hmm and then you go up Everest anything artificial you use in nature doesn't make you having the right connection with nature and what I wanted to challenge in all the challenges I did like marathons beyond the Polar Circle in midwinter in short but also in the heat of the desert without drinking or hanging by one finger on a 1/2 kilometer or like a mile and up in the air what in with the time you hung on by one finger a mile up in the air yes yes where was this at that altar in Hotlanta between two hot air balloons and then climbing between them and then there was a you know a ping a device I could just hooked it on with one thing yes how long did you hang there for at 25 seconds Jesus 25 seconds and with one finger and in winter time in wintertime you know you lose control when the blood becomes colder in the hands yeah you lose control so that was the challenge it's mind over matter and I wanted to show that in all the challenges the adaptive power of ours is enormous but as we are not stimulating or using that anymore you get a neglected body and become sick or half put in its potency and so all very logic so the powers that our body has the untapped powers that we probably had for millennia dealing with the cold dealing with the heat dealing with adversity dealing with struggle all those powers are not being tapped into so because of that the body just atrophies and we don't it doesn't know what to do with self exactly [Music]
