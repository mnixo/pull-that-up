hello freak bitches for the social justice warrior types out there who might be listening it's like do are you really willing to say that every single person who's accomplished something has done that as a consequence of oppression that's again what the Soviets claimed with regards to the to the successful peasants in the nineteen in the just before the 1920s it's like well the peasants weren't emancipated they were serfs until about thirty years before that they were serfs they were basically slaves and some of them had clambered up to the point where maybe they owned their hot and a cow and could you don't employ someone well the Soviet claim was well that's all theft you got that all because you're an oppressor and so then the Soviet intellectuals went into the villages and just imagine how this happened so imagine a village a small town where everyone knows everybody and there's maybe 1020 people there who are moderately successful okay and so you can imagine that those twenty people have like a hundred enemies at the bottom of the socio-economic distribution useless horrible people who are jealous and resentful about the fact that these people have been successful okay so now the intellectuals come in and say property is theft success is oppression and then they look for the people in the village who are willing to move against those twenty successful people well those guys at the bottom those hundred resentful jealous murderous people at the bottom they're just waiting for an opportunity to go kick down some doors and that's exactly what they did in the 1920s and as I said they wiped out all their productive peasants and then six million Ukrainians starved to death they had posters the Soviets produced posters in the 1930s that said essentially don't forget it's wrong to eat your children so whoa yeah whoa there's nothing about the Soviet there's nothing that you can imagine that's horrible enough so that it matched the reality of what happened in the Soviet Union between 1919 and 1959 I think also technology is just it's just trying to get us more and more addicted to it I was thinking of this the other day and I was flying back from Hawaii I was thinking of how many people I see stare at a phone at the airport at the fucking mall and a restaurant myself I'm staring at my old phone well I mean I'm not immune to it we're all staring at fucking phones and I'm like if I was a pilgrim if you took took you went back in a time machine he grabbed a pilgrim and you dragged him to 2016 and he said what are you saying maybe like my god there are prisoners to the looking-glass you've been captured like they were like it's like they're under spell they're under spell they stare at a fucking glass screen first thing in the morning they check their email to go to work they stare at a screen they look at their navigation system while they're fucking driving to work they get home they watch TV before they go to bed they check their email again they're just staring at fucking screens they're living their lives through screens looking glass it's captivated though I would think they were under the spell of glass like there's something about something bond they're not moving they're just sitting there in front of this fucking thing all day they're almost there's almost no movement almost all the time you're in front of a screen you're just sitting there yeah if you saw that and you had no idea what the fuck a television was or a phone you were just a person from another time period and you said what do you think's going on like with these fucking people under a spell they're clearly under a like it's giving them something yeah but that's what a spell is I mean the fucking when the the hypnotic dancer dances in front of you and then all sudden you don't even know where you are anymore it's cuz you're looking at something cool you got the strip club yeah exactly way there you go know where you are yeah edible that Joey Diaz gave you that was mislabeled on purpose you this is what you're seeing you're seeing something amazing and that amazing thing is making you want more of it so you're you're spending more money to get a better computer to make better explosions on the bigger screen that has the better sound and it keeps going deeper and deeper and every fucking new phone has some new way to get you excited and keep your stare at the newest and best screen and just locked into this this sort of hypnotic trance of technology oh it allowable it allows you to Bluetooth with your navigation system it syncs up to your car like you're still staring at a fucking screen and not doing anything yeah doesn't matter what's happening the same effect is taking place you're staring at a screen but I've identified this sort of thing the the Nydia I've been working on called Yellowstone syndrome though as where people Americans some cement and wildlife politics and wildlife management comes from the Yellowstone story that they wind up having a difficult time understanding wildlife and wildlife management and situations that are outside of a national park setting which is to say they don't have a very good grasp on the inevitable conflicts that are gonna arise between wildlife and society and and that's a large chunk of ground where you just do not have those sorts of conflicts like what kind of conflicts we're talking about Oh like for instance a thing that's been very difficult and very vexing for wildlife managers is what happens to what what happens to Buffalo when they leave national the Yellowstone National Park just I mean to back up on the on the Yellowstone ejido just to get a sense for how revolutionary that idea was you know there was the Indian Wars weren't even over when they made Yellowstone Yellowstone you know we're still battling American Indians on the Great Plains when Yellowstone went into effect matter of fact Yellowstone was a park when the Nez Perce were chased through by the US Army and they actually killed a couple tourists in Yellowstone right at some of the buildings that are still there yeah so you went to Harlem and got shot by Indians who are engaged in a war with the US Army it was like it was it was like they hadn't even you know the West hadn't even been in some ways that the center west hadn't even been settled and never made you know and they made the National Park and enrolls Belt went there no you know at the commemoration like it was you know went there to to applaud it you know people look at me as if I still don't have my shit together but the only thing that I did was I took a peel that I thought was gonna give me a boner and literally it's caused me a lot of heartache and a lot of disappointment and a lot of yeah just threw me back you there in any way shape or form when someone gives you this pill you don't know where it came from you don't know what did you think man I don't know what's in this no I didn't know I didn't think of it because um I have been dealing with the Athletic Commission I've been in the UFC for a long time and I've taken little gas-station take pills before like you know like and I've never failed the drug test ever well you did you ever think that you might have got lucky no I didn't think I got lucky I thought that you fell drug test when you're doing sketchy shit right but
