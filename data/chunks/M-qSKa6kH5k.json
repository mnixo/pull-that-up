join my day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day which brings us to the fight that was pulled off this card Cain Velasquez Versa breezy over doom the rematch which everybody was looking forward to and Cain did that meeting with that uh that whatever that I'm a Association yes the fighters Association and said that he's gonna have to have a surgery after this fight and they went what why did you do that he fucked up you they like you can't say you need a surgery before you have a major fight first of all that that's going to fuck with the betting lines there's a disaster there that's gonna fuck with the insurance if something happens to you and then afterwards they say oh you know you you told us that you were already hurt we're not paying for this like do you get paid for like when you're in training camp and you get to a fight and you have to pull out because they injury you don't get nothing right what do you get uh nothing nothing got nothing so if he chose to fight with that injury he said he was gonna be a hundred percent he's gonna have a cortisone injection and the doctors disagreed the Nevada State Athletic Commission disagreed that uh bob bennett guy he doesn't fucking play any games man he's like you can't say something like that Kingsman and is this too long to do that i fucked up he fucked up he's just emotional when I called Lineker a little monkey earlier I fucked up didn't came fucked up you just talk you say things you know yeah I was gonna say well that's kind of racist but I call myself a monkey though I just it sounds sounds worse than it really is it's not racist it's not really I'm the last person racist but the point is with when it comes to Cain is that it was a giant error and that error pulled him off of this card and now he's gonna have to fight he's gonna have to get surgery and then he'd have to fight whoever the fuck is left and you're talking about more months out and then even more examination next time and it's going to cost him a shitload of money a ton of money went through the entire camp he was a week out and they pull him from it and then he was saying I don't know what it's about I'm a hundred percent good to go I've been told I've been cleared so he was tweeting that he had been told that he was cleared right before they pull him I thought you know I think you give the guy physical examination in terms of his movement like what can you do like how do you how do you tell a guy this is hurt business-wise you came to get his back in his back this is why you can't cuz the UFC goes man you have a bulging disc Corazon shot and then if you get punched in the face by Purdue Murray get the guilty and you're paralyzed you see the fucking real true ok business you just can't do that no deny I don't think it falls on cane knows better the the people around in this Association shouldn't have let them do that well first of all they should have known about first the Bjorn Rebney thing is very weird like I was reading what Jon Fitch had written that Jon Fitch rather in an interview said that he was very disturbed by all this because there's a class-action lawsuit and what they're saying is that if the class-action lawsuit is dropped like that they could form this this Union and if they all agreed to abandon the class-action lawsuit it would it would like help the strength and form the Union and Jon Fitch was like what like so you're saying that the UFC would accept you as a union if you abandon the class-action lawsuit that we've been chasing down for two years now without picking any sides like if you're on the side of the fighters not picking any sides you just have to look at that and go well what benefit would it be for the people that are not in this to accept that the class-action lawsuit is dropped this all sounds like someone's trying to get some money right there's no one's doing this for free that's like what everybody has to realize when it comes to like these agencies and there's like three different competing ones that are stepping in right one soon the other there's associate the two big ones there's association is the Union yeah well ultimately I think we all want the same thing we all want fighters to be compensated fairly want them to make a lot of money because it's a short window of time and it's an awesome sport to watch right correct so you got a wonder does this help that does this help them there's do any of these organizations they haven't yet because the if they can get together and organize and they're gonna fight right then no one's going to take you serious there's three different leaders three different ones and they all want different things and then you got to wonder whose agendas over here whose agendas over here what it has to come it can't come from businessman can't come from another promoter has to come from the fighters the five is you know I'm saying you know and I'm not saying current fighters because they need to fight and then they need to have someone speak for them who's been there but you can't have these business guys with other agendas trying to get things done or or in Beorn's case he has this you know weird jealousy with Dana and what see him destroyed we can't have that why are you speaking for us what are you doing yeah you don't have the respect to the fighters what the fuck you doing and notice he's taking a seat back because everyone when everyone saw him speaking they're like we're out man yeah well he was going in this old-school Bellator when he was running things over there and King mo is pissed off at them and King mo Mouse to this day calls him a dick Rider all the time the hope it's not good when you got a guy like King mo very respected guy who has horrible things to say about you and I talked Association what are you guys doing like yeah what you have one way to make an impression and you do this you put your best foot forward with this guy and then well I don't know the dude do you know I know of fighters who have dealt with them I never fought for Bellator so I know inside the fighter circle that people have dealt with him for manage and stuff like that but I don't personal I was looking at all the tweets and all the negative stuff I think you can take a very positive angle about improving the life and the conditions of these fighters without attacking people yeah there's no there's no reason attacking it's also say what you want about Dana White it's not his job to make sure you guys get your shit together and form an association he's like I'm a businessman I put on fights if you guys want to do that cool get your shit together and then bring it to and then let's figure something out but if you guys are fighting with each other you know technology [Music]
