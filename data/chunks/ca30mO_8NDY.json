is it working is it live says it's live Gregory we're live this is it this is it yeah four there's definitely more of an echo in this room we're gonna have to do some tweaking ladies and gentlemen this is episode number one in the new spot Oh Jamie's fucking up already Jesus does extra mics on I had all the mics on oh the back oh that sounded pain yeah changed everything yeah you're a wizard how'd you notice you could feel it he gets censored in the room he should be behind a curtain like The Wizard of Oz yeah what color was the Wizard of Oz his curtain was green right wasn't it yes yeah Gregory welcome I feel so happy to be here on the first episode dude I'm honored I'm honored that you're number one yeah this is perfect yeah this is perfect fuck it's crazy right he just gave me a tour of this place and it's like I I saw the first half and was like what the fuck's he gonna do with all this space the back half is bigger than the first half well it's gonna be a gym yes an actual full gym I don't like going places do it all right here catch your tank your sauna there's a 47-yard indoor archery range in here yeah yeah that's gonna be badass yeah why not fuck it but the big thing is to set up the studio and to have it as close to the old one as possible we basically we built it sort of the only difference is the sky thanks to octo lights now we have clouds in this guy instead of stars I decided to mix it up a little bit change the curtain caller I love that it feels the same as the other one now pretty fucking soon I mean the dimensions are are they exact the dimensions very close and this is this is a standalone and this was built so it was built to the same size yeah this was this did not exist so this is all like constructed basically we just I had all these ideas like well I'll do it this way and I'll do the I'll make a table that's different and then and then as time went on and I started doing the planning and everything I said do you know what I don't I don't think I want to change much at all like this table first of all is giant like I love this table and it's got all this weird history to it yeah little bend to it yeah well when we got it the wood hadn't been killed kiln dry kiln dried yeah yeah so wooden wood sits out or it goes anywhere it gets damp and then when it dries out it starts to warp a little bit and change and shift so it's got a little warp to it yeah it's this desk out history it's got history and the red brick wall looks exactly the same yeah pretty close pretty close we're rolling Jamie's over there in his spot it's pretty close I mean it's like it doesn't I have to remind myself that we're in a new spot that's perfect yeah I mean after we do a few episodes here we'll be like oh just this is the spot after if I companion yeah yeah especially once the boozing starts again once the boozing in the weed starts again in November how hard is that been for you easy really super easy like Izzy the other day we went to Mexican food and I wanted a margarita no way damn I can't have Margaret yeah that's it that's literally my only craving people talk to you about like because the initial thing wasn't quitting wheat right the initial thing was just getting Bert Kreischer to not die so like our idea was like let's see if we can get him to go sober for a month yeah and he was like I can run a marathon I'm like would stop fuck this well like listen how about instead of you running a marathon we just have you do 15 hot yoga classes and they're like oh that'll be easy Mike she hasn't even done one yeah you don't know if it's easy and now they're they're slogging away through like I think they're all like number six or seven do we have video of Bert in a hot yoga class no video no but they take videos after him and Tom get out and they're both you know beet-red and it's covered in sweat it's pretty obviously calories drenched yeah but Bert was done amazing first of all his his blood pressure has dropped radically he was actually on high blood pressure medication yeah and after this after stopping drinking just immediately his blood pressure dropped like radically yeah so like he doesn't even need blood pressure medication if he doesn't drink that's amazing it's the only thing that's doing him in is the booze right so and then but people would come up to me about the weed so the weed wasn't in the original bet the original bet was just no booze yeah which I thought would be pretty easy and then they're like all right we're gonna go new no weed too and I was like no weed fuck you like I'm just doing this for Burt like I don't want to stop smart know that they're giving me a hard time about it they started this hashtag pray for Joe campaign because I was addicted to pot uh-huh so I initially thought I'll just get off we did not tell them until the end and go it was fucking easy pussies yeah but then Ari was making such a big deal out of it I would say actually dude I'm not smoking pot either just to let the cat out of the bag Tom Segar already knew but people come up to you like like you're not eating for a month like you okay Yeah right how do you feel yeah you you off heroin for good you know but it's such a party I don't know for you isn't it never seem like an addiction drugs to for my vision of you doing drugs is it's always mind expanding and it's always just to relax it's never like an addiction it never felt like you needed to I definitely don't need it obviously because I've had some great sets too it's been very interesting so I usually like to go on stage hi I haven't done that at all though no no pot for 17 days is that what today is what's today the 17th so no pot for 17 days where do you miss it the most before going on no I haven't missed it wow it's been weird you know I was like maybe there's gonna be a moment or like wow I'd like to have some weed I'm a little nervous about smoking again yeah cuz I know I'm gonna get so hot I'm so paranoid I all these demons gonna come creeping up into my consciousness paranoid yeah psychic demons okay you're just gonna come floating by it's like that first orgasm after you get your prostate removed yeah man for real you know like once once you're back you know it's just it just seems like it seems like it's can hit you way way way harder mmm that's what everybody says yeah you take a month off and then you get back on the pot then you know why everybody freaks out when you get them high you know because we're so used to getting high that when we get high it's no big deal yeah but when people don't get high and like I'll smoke a little weed with you but they haven't smoked pot maybe like six months or something like that yeah those people are fucked right they're in a bad place yeah I got a nice easy rhythm going I got the little vape pen and I'm when I'm on the road you know Thursday Friday night a couple hits that's pretty much it and you never do it before shows right never never ever and you took a long time like when when I first met you we back in the day um when we first started out you would just quit boobs right just quit yeah and you weren't doing nothing no pot no booze no nothing like what was it that made you realize I could smoke a little weed it was New Year's Eve of 90 2004 whoa so I did not smoke pot for 14 years or drank or anything and then I'm standing outside of the improv in San Francisco and I'm with I won't mention the manager's name but a manager who smokes a lot of pot that we all know and love and the entire cast of the marijuana logs this Doug Benson Tony kameen and Brian Posehn and they're all there it's just like a weird thing where you know I don't know if you ever done two years eve in San Francisco but there's like three different venues that all do comedy you know there's Cubs is the punchline and then there's a big theater that the Palais the Palace of Fine Arts or whatever and then there's an after-party at the punchline and it's the greatest afterparty because usually go on the road and after your show you're just kind of alone maybe you got your opener or whatever and you hang out but this is always like you know every comic in San Francisco comes together and I'm standing up front and and they're standing there with a joint they handed to me and I just I felt like this is the moment I'm supposed to smoke pot again and I did and and then the weirdest fucking thing happened is I went down to help Molly you know she had a van coming from the palace and she had a box of booze that had been the backstage bar and she's carrying a bottle of vodka and she's walking towards the steps and this group we were talking about San Francisco homeless people before group of like you know they're like 21 and they're like street urchins they're like you know it's almost like yeah the warias come out it's like that type of person and they grab the bottle of booze out of Molly's hand and I'm standing there with Todd Barry Paul F Tompkins and like I think Greg Proops there's like two guys in suits and so they grab this bottle from Molly and she chases after them I'm like what the fuck are you doing that's not your booze it's the club's booze and she runs right in the middle of them and they she grabs the bottle and she's fighting with this woman over it and these guys are surrounding her and I run in and I grab her and start pulling her out but at the same time guys fists cocked waiting to take a shot at me and I'm yelling to these guys hey how about a little help here and nothing and so I kind of pull her out of there and we have run away and then as we're walking up the stairs they threw a blockbuster an m-80 oh Jesus and it landed right near us and it blew out oh and um it was Leslie people don't know what that means it's a firecracker like over superb it's an eighth of a stick of dynamite is it really that yeah that's what an m-80 is Jesus Christ I didn't know was that powerful yeah I mean you feel it in your chest and blew out Molly's hearing for like a year and people were crying it was like really traumatic and I'm high I'm like this is the fucking work after 14 years I was just like fuck this is nuts I was walking the girl back to the hotel because she was sobbing I wasn't TIG it was it was a lesbian comedian who had a girlfriend with her and yeah it was fucking crazy whoa yeah yes we were talking about how San Francisco is just a little bit too lenient with their homeless population yeah they're just a little silly with it and we were talking about how they have it mapped out where people shit in the streets now so you could avoid human shit yeah it's either a website or an app I'm not sure which one it is but they they're basically keeping up to date human poo stats how do they know it's human versus dog probably smells worse people are gross baby this little toilet paper next dog shit all over the house last night my dogs I have a young dog in two old dogs right and my big old dog is a mastiff and he's super cool with every dog any dog comes over here doing yeah he's super friendly but my little dog is kind of a twat so I'm going out the lights well it's just dim oh the train off Oh scary spooky what kind of dog is the little dog what is that Jamie oh so things were not here oh well how do we fix that that's dumb okay anyway the little dog is uh he's not that little he's a medium-sized dog I guess he's a Shiba Inu English bulldog mix right nice and he has he has an issue with any dog he's a little cunt like any dogs like her yeah and the puppy is 11 months old I have a golden retriever he's a sweet star it's great he's the best but he can't go near the Bulldog the bull dog bit him his face when he was a puppy oh shit really hurt I'm like put a big cut in his nose the vet was so two of the dogs sleeping this one little contained area but they opened up the door and wandered around the house and just took a shit in the middle of the living room pissed on the wall and they did all this because the other dog in the house the other dog is in there like well if he's in here we're just gonna shit all over the place and mark this place up they never never done that before it was really interesting like dog psychology like they were pissed that the other dog gets to be in better spots than them so yes I'd to shit in the living room wow that's a statement statement you know it's funny because the big one I could have him with the new dog no problem he loves them yeah they play together you know they he has a great time but I just don't trust another one so what are you gonna do shoot the other one the head hunting accident just keep him separated I mean I can have him around together when I'm there mm-hmm you know he's he's a cool old dog he likes people he loves people like people come over he loves yeah he's a very sweet dog he just doesn't it's apparently an English bulldog trait they just do not like other dogs yeah they just don't they want tough dogs and they and they have a lot of health issues they fucking wheeze he's had two surgeries on his knees both his front knees are fucked up yeah he's just got like they just it's a terrible thing what they've done designing them like taking them and putting them into this shape that it's really not supposed to exist shortening their nose yeah that's like it's really fucked up yeah what they've done yeah just yeah that breed may need to be put down but some it's weird like why why did anybody decide to have a dog that has a flat face that can't breathe can't walk very good yeah they just want they're always in pain so they just want to lie down like those dogs don't they're not ball chasers all right the you like you throw a ball to an English bulldog he's like fuck off yeah running after that thing everything hurts yeah you know it's weird because the original Bulldog was a dog that they literally used to use for what they call bull baiting what bull baiting is they would tie a bull down and so it couldn't go anywhere and then they would SiC the dogs on the bull that's what a bulldog yeah it's like what was the point of that I don't know just to fuck with - I'd have to look into it no I think it was like a betting thing oh you know it's like a blood sport thing yeah that's that's originally what a bulldog looked like do you know what American Bulldog looks like now American Bulldog is like sort of pitbull esque but larger like much larger American Bulldog is a lot like God it kind of a pitbull like face sort of a flat nose but nothing like an English Bulldog they're really smart dogs they're very good dogs I could the buddy might had one and it was great dog their tanks they're like this big jacked up like like but a totally functional dog with a run they use them for protection the you know they're they're just really good dogs and the English version of them is like what that dog is is like I might be fucking this up but I think they took the that dog and somehow another bred it down to this really gross cute fat flat nose shitty breathing English bulldog did they want it to look like the royal family only fuck your sister and they took those puppies no no you can't fucking fuck your sister okay and then babies fuck each other your babies fucking each other yeah yeah you look fine as Irish just I don't know when just it's weird that they all came from wolves you know a wolf could fuck an English bulldog and get it pregnant that's what's incredible it's like the jet the genetics are the same and they didn't know this until like I want to say less than a decade ago yeah they used to think that all wolves were like wolves and then dogs were like a combination of a bunch of different things wild canids like jackals and coyotes and all these different things and that we had somehow or another bred them down because there's no real record of how anybody ever did that and if you go back to the history of domesticated dogs it spans over 10,000 years predates human history yeah we'd really don't know how the fuck anybody made a chihuahua we just know that it's chihuahuas right I know that the first domesticated dogs were the ones that basically were were you know docile that could come near the fire yes and so the ones that were friendly or a nicer captain they killed the other ones I put up a picture on Instagram yesterday I reposted some facilities set me with this fucking lady found a young coyote and she thought it was a dog that she washed it and they put it up on Facebook it's kind of aggressive but now it's sleeping and it's like a little coyote and this lady's washing a fucking coyote people just writing it's it's kind of she gets her period it just fucking lunges at attack sir there is no collar seems a bit aggressive also it doesn't like bass but she was pretty dirty took took post to the night but she's resting comfy now on the bed look at that thing that is a fucking coyote obviously and it's obviously a little one too yeah it's probably a young one look a yearling or something yeah you can't domesticate a coyote but you can in a weird way I know a guy who I don't know him but I know his Instagram account I forget his name shit but anyway oddly enough this guy has dogs that he uses to hunt coyotes with which is really constant kill hunt to kill and he found coyote puppies in a den and so they found these coyote puppies in the den and he felt bad these little coyote puppies like I don't know what happened to the mother so they raised one so he took a coyote puppy in and now it lives with him Wow yeah and it gets a lot like the only problem is when they feed it is that him yeah so chicken German Shepherd yeah I mean but he's had it since it was a baby the dog I think that is I don't know if that's him but this guy has all this video of it on a site of him with this coyote puppy with his other dogs they're all barking together and shit and he said they only were the only they get along great until it's time to eat and when it's time to eat the Coyotes like fuck off this just is like full feral as soon as it's time to eat but he's had the thing since I think he said it was like a couple months old when he got it just freshly weaned that's amazing yeah you can you can raise them but they're wolves coyotes are wolves my friends have a dingo what yeah did it eat the baby dingo ate my baby and this thing is the same way if you got some food on the counter and it's four feet off the ground that fucking thing you leave the room for one second that food is gone yeah they're just feral yeah what's funny like my puppy was like that when he was a little it's like I was I mean that's how puppies are and I bet I forgot because I haven't had a puppy in a while and I was eating and I put some food on his plate and he saw his like oh I want some of that he jumped up put his feet on a table leaned in and tried to try to bite it and got a piece of meat in his mouth and I was like hey fucker you know I got to teach him this yeah because they don't know like well the food's right there I get the food yeah he our neighbors were having people over they were having a party and I was over there and they had a husky fucking bad-ass Alaskan Husky and this thing was you know beyond puppy was big and they had meatball Swedish meatballs like four platters of him right out of the oven still fucking hot and they left the room and they came back and they were gone you know all the Swedish meatballs hot he didn't give a fuck yeah he's like he's my chance yeah a full belly or have a you know or burn your tongue and have a full bang or not no food and this is an Irish party this wasn't like there's Swedish meatballs and there's a sausage no Irish this one fucking thing and now it's gone the Swede all the food yeah yeah it's a weird relationship that humans have with dogs cuz you know a lot of people have dogs asleep in their beds they come with you places they hop in the car and then then there's the assholes that have those emotional support dogs yeah what is what's the jury out on that still it's fucking ridiculous part of modern 21st century life yeah that we allow that stupid shit I was in a fucking restaurant like a really nice restaurant this lady came in and she's a lady from Real Housewives she was one of those uh what's no not that show Desperate Housewives she's a famous actress I don't say her name very pretty lady oh yeah she hit the skids though but anyway she's bringing brings in this fucking dog and and people are looking at her like what it's a dog like a golden lab I'm a big dog yeah and she brings his dog and she's sitting there eating and there's dogs on the floor we're like you might drop a frog or your fork and pick it up and wipe it off this dog's assholes just rub it on the ground right there I mean basically you have this this animals dick is like rubbing on the ground and rubbing on things and dirt on its feet it's probably stepping in sharing and people have allergies to dogs you for send up their night 100% yeah in this somehow or another they can get a note from their doctor that says they're too fucking weak to exist without this dog with them 24 hours a day yeah it's an emotional support dog this is a lot of comics that have them yeah but it's a like a loophole like natasha has one but she like openly admits it's a loophole so she can't bring the dog everywhere she's got a doctor's note yeah it says she's soft yeah I think is uh what's her name's has to be Elijah Liza's yeah sure that thing doesn't leave her side yeah she'll make you watch it though when she goes on stage here hold this grace Yeah right what yeah I know and then people finger it I loved I don't know a lot of people do I know I saw here I heard the dog waits for her to go out and just takes it's a sneer that's right sense yeah it presents just literally runs backwards she's gonna hear this would be so bad we're kidding me Eliza we're kidding don't call her Eli's I either should get mad at that too yeah Eliza you know she doesn't use the last name anymore well neither does that well Christina is Christina P now really Sebastian Maniscalco is just Sebastian now are white people getting crazy lately TIG Notaro is just TIG is that culture appropriation choose a white person to use only one name I always forget what's culture appropriation we need to constantly be reminded I tweeted something today I was reading a fucking article and I almost punched my screen they're saying that hoop earrings are cultural appropriation now girls aren't allowed to wear hoop earrings really cultural appropriation damn do you how fucking privileged do you have to be like how softly the hoop earrings criticizes cultural appropriation do you know how soft you have to be to give in to that to give you that and how how fucking dumb you have to be to say that yeah you have to be so dumb if you're just racist I think it's the UH it's the emphasis is racist against white people no it's race against black but what they're jungle jungle people that only wear giant fucking hoops in their ears what I read was Latinos Latinas are criticizing it and saying it's a part of their culture it's their culture yeah it's like people just know black people don't want girls to wear braids cornrows can't wear cornrows yeah you can wear like regular white people braids but little skinny brains that's cultural appropriation what about Goldilocks she was white what about golf shirts are they a lot of our girls right they shouldn't be if they started AZ with these braids it's green pants here's the problem sell all this we bullshit the entire country is a melting pot of cultural appropriation you dumb cunts right that is the whole idea of having a civilization yeah is that you get to share each other's food share each other's recipes listen to each other's music listen to each other's jokes and stories get by each others clothes you know there was this journalist that went to Japan and they were talking about cultural appropriation whether or not they thought that like white girls like Katy Perry wearing the Geisha outfit was cultural appropriation and they were they were like universally saying no we're happy that people love Japanese culture yeah they do that they're happy yeah but over here you get these fucking dummies that are just looking to complain and criticize and just call out everything and everybody about everything yeah it's uh oh my god I I see this what is this no Jeremy Lin yeah so yeah came out with a in the preseason I think he had dreadlocks in his hair and a former NBA player called him out on it Kenyon Martin but Jeremy Lin's response to it was actually really good if you don't check that out hey man it's all good you have to like my hair and definitely entitled to your opinion actually eyelid i legit grateful you share in it TBH to be honest at the end of the day I appreciate that I have dreads and you have Chinese tattoos yeah because I think it's a sign of respect and I think as minorities the more we appreciate each other's cultures the more we influence mainstream society thanks for everything you did for the Nets and hoops I had your poster up on my wall growing up oh that's really classy somebody really need to tell him like alright bro we get it you want to be black like we get it but the last name is Lin all right well he said that the other guy who is the other guy Kenyon Martin there's a picture of his okay but it's been removed yeah well he's a dummy and that Jeremy Lin guy is a very classy character for the way he answered it first of all dreads are not black they they were a sign of people not washing their hair that dates back to the Greeks and the Romans there's ancient sculptures of Caucasian looking people with dreadlocks dreadlocks were worn by the Vikings is not a black thing hmm because some black people wear them does not mean it's a book I mean the idea that this is a real thing this cultural appropriation that people go around pointing at people saying you can't wear your hair a certain way yeah like we're limiting hairstyles and it's just so many people are just looking forward to criticizing shitty with people over almost nothing yeah it's just snow the whole the whole energy of this country is supposed to be complete assimilation like you said let's pick the best shit from each culture and make it just American hodgepodge and that's what it's about with gentrification you know you want people to not all live in one neighborhood and all dress exactly the same as each other you want there to be a merging of different looks yeah different addresses sure working in different trades you know there used to be if you were Irish you were a cop that's it that's what we fuckin did you know we were cops or we were soldiers when we first came over here in like the 1860s during the famine they just we got off the boat hungry and they threw a fucking uniform on us and sent us in to fight front lines against the south or you were a cop and then after that they got into the trades there's a lot of Irish people in unions right you know a lot of Irish in the Longshoremen's Union a lot of Irish in the you know the Carpenters Union yeah but look fusion restaurants what's a fusion restaurant yeah take a couple different cultures you combine their food and to some sort of a unique thing and it's it was a big thing for a while people loved fusion yeah they loved that kind of food and now there's a ton of people complaining when white people cook Mexican food yeah like there's this famous guy I forget his name can't be that famous I guess he's not that famous I forget his name but he's a famous white guy who loves Mexican food and he opened up a Mexican restaurant and all these people got pissed that this guy is cooking Mexican food but this guy's been writing books about Mexican cuisine he goes down to Mexico he learns how to cook authentic Mexican dishes from people that live in these villages and towns in Mexico and and like has a deep love and appreciation for the culture of Mexico yeah I mean sky is essentially a Mexican cuisine scholar and all these people give this fucking poor guy that's his name alt what is his name Bayless Rick Bayless hmm and he's famous I mean I've read one of his books on Mexican food and I've seen articles written on them and video interviews and stuff and this guy is getting in in trouble with other people when chefs become famous cooking other cultures food you don't own your culture you fucking idiot you know why because you didn't create it you didn't invent pizza you didn't invent pasta you didn't invent Chinese food it's been around for hundreds of fucking years you were just born you were born with a certain ethnicity you don't own that ethnicity the idea that you can keep other people from enjoying it and appreciating the history of other human beings is fucking racist and it's stupid this this thing that we're getting into we're criticizing people you know based on various aspects of culture that they enjoy it's insanity yeah it's insanity I know think about how Italians have affected do you like fashion in this country sure I mean from high fashion all the way down to like the disco era when I was seven music right we're all calling themselves gaudy in right we're all calling Al Capone yeah I mean come on man I mean how many fuckin rap songs like have Godfather lyrics in them again it's just cut the shit it's so stupid yeah it's so stupid and that's my culture I'll tell you can have it that's why I love one of the seminal moments in American culture was Aerosmith getting together with DMC and doing Walk This Way that was that's what America is supposed today you know it's just it's kids today looking to point the finger the world they see and looking to find fault in it and find fault in each other and it's this callout culture that we see hmm there's plenty of shit that's wrong in the world there's plenty of shit hmm and I guess this is just a byproduct of people having the freedom to communicate I mean I guess that's what we're seeing but there's there's plenty of shit to really pay attention to Jeremy Lin wearing dreadlocks isn't on that list you know the girls that wear hoop earrings are on that list it's just fucking white kids that wear baggy pants so what so what who gives a shit yeah to me that's a sign they're like accepting black culture yet they want to inter intermix they want to hang out together and share each other's fashions and ideas and drugs and women well the white people especially like from the suburbs have always looked towards black people that grew up in difficult circumstances and admired something about how tough they were or how how you know street smart or how cool cool they were they were people that look it takes pressure to make a diamond you don't make a diamond in Sherman Oaks you know yeah hello we went to the Galleria it was crazy we went to the food court we're radical yeah that's not you know those those people that live in these like safe suburban neighborhoods the one thing that the troubled kids coming up want to be they want to be associated in some way with something tougher something harder something where you know people have had to earn their stripes that's why they have this love of rap music especially gangsta rap mm-hmm you mean that has always been that's always been an issue yeah it's young white kids like since since gangster rap was invented there's always been like young white kids who live in the suburbs who I mean it's always comical watching them sing the lyrics talking about robbing people and shooting people and doing drugs and yeah you know meanwhile they're living in Thousand Oaks or something yeah whose son was it was it like Tom Hanks yes yes the big rapper Tom Hanks Hanks song as a rapper and get so much shit yeah I don't know if it's Tom Hanks has commented on it but it's gotta suck yeah cuz he's got to support him it's his son but the kid is like that's a limo line-level life says that on his knuckles oh good lord oh boy poor Tom Hanks he did everything right what did he do wrong yeah but he didn't do everything right see because he's working all the time yeah I work too much yeah if you're working all the time is that his son with the green hair and the neck tattoos and right hand

Wow imagine as your kid imagine if I was your kid ya fuckin take him down take his back and I would put him to sleep and then I take pictures of my dick on his forehead yeah yeah how to outline it that's inner that's intervention time son of a bitch we have you're threatening the greatest radio personality in the history of the known universe cuz he said you you're a fuckin goof yeah and what do you do you act like a fuckin goof god dammit maybe he is bad I will assault you so hard but think about it why can't a rich guy be a badass he maybe he is violent maybe he's a little fucking nuts he likes guns I I've never heard his rap do we have any of his rap available there are I'm sure rich guys who grew up rich who severely overcompensate because they feel like they live in this soft environment so they fucking go to CrossFit every day and yeah Jitsu and become a hard-ass yeah I don't think he's on that list now I don't think Tom Hanks was beating his ass at night I just don't I just think what he's doing is just trying to be hard yeah and trying to respond to Howard Stern calling him out about that it's just like come on kid like did was your dad not around can you call him and talk to him about it he would see he would say what the fuck you gonna say yeah don't say that how old is he if he's under 23 I'll give him a pass it's almost like God he's son member God he's got a son who was always trying to be a badass well God his son was a criminal yeah though I mean he was in the family a family business I guess it's different with the Glitter yeah mafia well he's not like dr. Dre's kid yeah you know I'm saying he's fucking Forrest Gump's kid no disrespect Tom Hanks I'm a big fan I loved you in The Green Mile he's a great he's a great actor he's the best AG he's a great actor and uh by all accounts a lovely person yes I don't know if he did his job or not I mean I'm just talking shit about him not being around but I just got to assume that if you're doing that many movies you're not around it's producing to be don't you then they have a studio also I don't know I think he's got his hand in a studio as well that's always amazing to me it's like you're being handed literally if you're Tom Hanks you're the first guy that gets offered every script it's in your age range that comes along what are you gonna do Saul so what do we take on the headache of producing movies maybe enjoys it but would have been enjoying hanging out with your family a little bit I got weirded out with him when he started doing those movies about like the fucking secret biblical fucking DaVinci Code yeah I was like did you read these scripts yeah that was bad these are terrible movies you goddamn Tom Hanks who's a bad book house it has a bad book and I become a good movie there was just so clunky yeah I was like seems to me like something someone does when they don't have anything else to do and the guy who wrote the book Dan something down Dan Brown he I think had a hand in the movie hmm so he whatever chance it had of upgrading was destroyed well I don't think they wanted to upgrade I think it's like I mean did they want to upgrade the fucking what is the the vampire movie that the girls like where the vampire is allowed to live in the day Twilight they not ending upgrade Twilight right they wanted to give them the ocular yeah I think they kind of did are you secret I got a daughter I've seen it I've seen them and they're fucking great to get emotional I could see the milk coming out of your nipples where you say yes ridiculous dude I just took her to see the Beach Boys last weekend oh my god the real Beach boy it was Brian Wilson and it was I've didn't one of them died recently um I think one of the brothers might have died but it was Al Jardine who founded the Beach Boys with Brian Wilson and then they had a couple other than they had algae Ardennes Sun who couldn't hit the fucking notes now his son is a badass singer but it was just fucking great they play the entire Pet Sounds album song by song oh wow and then they played all the hits and it was just me and my daughter just had such a fucking blast because she has she's 14 and she loves fucking like the Mamas and the Papas and the Allman Brothers and Sheryl jam and she's got amazing tastes and she's she's a surfer she's been surfing for five years like three days a week Wow the Beach Boys are her favorite said Pet Sounds is her favorite album so that was my birthday present was two tickets and I brought her and she was singing to every fucking word and we were laughs and we had a contest about every time you see a Hawaiian shirt you get to punch the other person in the arm if you see a bald guy with a ponytail that's two punches open-toed sandals with the Hawaiian shirt and the ponytail was three punches the shoe must have beat the fuck up she fucking nailed me cuz I got bad eyes she was spotting these guys 400 yards away well and yeah fucking Beach Boys concert you get beaten to death yeah all right it's Kennison had a bit about the Beach Boys in the fucking 80s he had a beat a bit about the Beach Boys phoning it in in the 80s he goes you can tell they're just looking at the watch I'll tell you what though fucking gives you goosebumps when you hear it really it really cuz you well you realize he's not gonna be doing this much longer right and you know that's I feel that way when I see the stones I want to see fucking shell where'd you see the stones I saw them in giant Stadium and then I saw them at the Staples Center I heard Mick Jagger is uh very frugal that's a nicer idea that's what I heard yeah like how could you be yeah he's gotta be worth hundreds of millions of dollars yeah he's still performing all over the world right just saving that cash that's right putting it away for a rainy day he's got a lot of a lot of kids a lot of wives that's right he's got a bunch of baby moms yeah but still the money crazy money he's got a recent one does he yeah he knocked a chick up a couple years ago Nick she's hot - I think she's Brazilian and I think she's like 28 or something like that and how old is he 7 she's a ballerina so she's a ballerina so if he's 75 you're guaranteeing that this child will experience his father's death in the first 20 years of his life yeah I want something really crazy happen right like technologically yeah like medical technology gets to some point where they can reverse aging which is apparently when you talk to people who are like legitimate scientists about this like this is not outside the realm of possibility yeah by any stretch of the imagination like within our lifetime it is entirely possible that they figure out a way to stop the aging process dead in its tracks yeah well Silicon Valley believes it all those dudes have got think tanks going for cryogenically saving well cryogenics I would imagine if you do it regularly I bet that difference you did you're talking about cryotherapy genex is actually freezing the body dead right yeah cryotherapy I would think would add some it is sometime well there's a company in Northern California that takes the blood of young people injects it into the bodies of old people and there's anecdotal research and research with mice that points to the fact that it's supposed to radically improve behavior and energy and mice and conversely when they take the older mice as blood and they put it in a younger Mouse than younger mouths like what the fuck you know starts acting like an old mouse know yeah yeah and so we had Eric Weinstein on the other day who works for Peter Thiel and Peter Thiel is that billionaire guy in Silicon Valley who he's a guy that funded that Hulk Hogan lawsuit against Gawker the crushed car yeah because they outed him apparently the outed him is being gay and he was really pissed at them they wrote some like really shitty articles about him and he was like all right fuck you how about I just use my money and crush you and so he went after that shit yeah apparently he's offering the women who've accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault he's offering each one of them $100,000 to go after him Wow yeah this guy he's he's like he's an interesting very interesting character but super rich super smart and doesn't give a fuck and so the rumor was that he was doing this therapy but since I've then I've heard that does not confirmed mmm what's that Jamie yeah the teal is not harvesting the blood of the young cow hey that's a good picture said Elon Musk though trying to work on some kind of life longevity thing kidding he's probably working on everything that's he ever he makes me feel really stupid he was at a comedy show once thought I did oh yeah with that chick that he just dumped Johnny Depp's old girlfriend and I got legitimately nervous didn't he was in the audience in the audience [Applause] [Laughter] inventors yeah I mean a guy like I as a comedian and I hope this doesn't come out the wrong way in order for me to be able to get onstage in front of hundreds of people and us and take the reins and go all right you hundreds of people are gonna all shut the fuck up I'm the funniest one of them I you all being quiet for an hour you have to do mind games with yourself sometimes like especially when you're starting out and so you have to sometimes if it's a gig I'm intimidated by I'll think to myself I'm smarter than everybody in this crowd I know I'm not but I have to tell myself that and then it's so hard when you get up and I remember I did a gig at this very hipster place in New York and Johnny Depp was in the audience and he was with some fucking model who looked like she was literally starving to death and everybody in the crowd was just in black and they were all hit and I really felt like and I said it on stage I go usually I just tell myself I'm better looking and I'm richer than everybody in the audience and tonight I realized I'm the poorest ugliest person here but a stupid thing to try to convince yourself ladies and gentlemen please welcome Greg Fitzsimmons Ball wrinkled short just shimmy on stage but that's the my game that's the trick it's like visualization why why that trick you're supposed to because I get scared I get intimidated not anymore but when I was starting out you still all the time well when I come back you know look at like starting out when you and I both started out we're both like 21 what the fuck does a 21 year old have to say about anything yeah we're so dumb I know like I imagined myself today going onstage at 21 like being in the room watching myself going onstage at 21 and just thinking what a fucking idiot yeah like you don't know anything about life yeah you're basically fresh out of high school mm-hmm just paying your own bills for like a couple of years yeah and here you are talking into a microphone we're grown adults like I went on stage exactly 16 days after it was legal for me to drink yeah and you got middle-aged people that have real jobs mortgages mortgages got back from the war people with college degrees master's degrees people have like pulled people out of burning buildings yeah yeah I've lost friends and gunfights guy widows yeah 21 year all talking to a widow trying to make them laugh fucking idiot I was but this but there's no other way to do it like Dane Cook said this once and this is a very insightful thing he was like if I had to do it again like if I had to start comedy again I really don't think I could do it he's like it was just it's so overwhelming the idea of starting again like 10 years in you know yeah but that's kind of what we've done with podcasting we started over again yeah I mean we had momentum because we had been in entertainment but I feel like it was a healthiest thing in the world the podcast for me because you know would have been all these years were doing stand-up and you get to a certain point where I always think of it as like your bottom and your top rise over the years they should they should continue like the worst bomb you're gonna have now is so much higher than the worst bomb you would have had five years ago ten years ago yeah 20 years ago and so you do need to challenge yourself and like with the podcast it's a whole different rhythm and it you're not you're not getting immediate feedback and and plus it's a business you got to build it you got to get your equipment and you got to you know sell ads and all that shit and it was like for me it was really good at whoa oh yeah I got it gave me confidence that I could do something new that's interesting because you already do in the radio show right well I did the podcast about a year after I started the radio show how long you been doing the podcast like eight or nine years mmm yeah I didn't think of it at all that way I thought of the podcast is just fun yeah just something to do for a goof and I did it for years like irregularly before I ever wound up committing to it but like every few weeks and then I rode in the green room we were doing the green room Joey Diaz would always get mad shut that fucking thing off you guys were all he's fucking online you fucking around online shut it off Joe Rogan he would get mad I'm like people like it you waste your fucking time on the Internet yeah I was relentless that's like the biggest part of his life I know his podcast is gigantic for him yeah yeah just did it the other night he was so high he fucking gave me the he forgot we're studio was so I said send me the address again so he since we had dressed if I can pull up on this dark road and I go to I go well he wants to suck if I can switch the studio or so because this isn't the old one so I or what the fuck it's a house I guess he's doing in the back of his house I can ring the doorbell it's his house it was so high he gave me his fucking a home address my frie I'm looking the fucking streets empty Greg Fitzsimmons and I walk in and he's chewing down those what are they Black Stars oh god he's got a bong going he's had mushrooms Lee syat is sitting there his eyes are shut Lee his eyes are shut I don't know I don't know how he does it leaks Lee can't handle it you could look in his eyes sometimes like I've been on this show before and when someone says something I always feel like we're having a conversation someone says so I'm like oh what do you mean by that yeah and then we haven't talked but if you say so like Lee said something I go what does that mean and he was like he was talking about how he was like like it seems like audio is the thing of the future I go what what do you mean he goes well it just seems like people like they are always on their phones while they're on TV or the watch the movie they're talking on their phone or they're looking through their phone or they're listening to things while they're doing other things are at what I'll get you wait you you're listening to things while you're watching TV you're what what who the fuck was playing with their phone while they're watching TV because du-ha Joey makes him do everything he does not only Joey do that Joey swaps edibles on them like Lee try this it's only 50 milligrams and he'll take a 500 milligram pot you know put it in the wrapper of a 50 and twist it back up it's mild cuz my full of them and so it gives them enough to make you reconsider your existence in the universe while he's running the soundboard any doesn't fuck up he's a good engineer this is very good yeah yeah it's like I don't know if it's healthy to be around Joey all the time like that like it can be really dangerous so good to have you know they just have like a very very unique relationship man I mean that that's a that's a goddamn show that relationship right there cuz Joey's like a father figure to him kind of yeah in some insane way yeah Joey's a sweetheart as long as you are on his side yeah but the worst place in the world is a guy who's against Joey right like Joey is what the worst I've seen like God Joey have Fugit people hmm it is a horrible thing to watch yeah you know like because he's so passionate about his friendship with people then when someone turns on him like he's the as loving and is friendly and his warm as he is like you know how he is like when he sees you it's all hugs and you know it calls you up because you Greg Fitzsimmons what's going on yeah that's it he's you guys hi you dick yeah what you doing dog you know loves you yeah I love Joey like I mean he's my family yeah hundred percent but if you turn on him man it's a fucking all right I've seen him go after people it's yeah yeah it's crazy he's so like it's he's Cuban yeah you know and you know he came up a really fucked up situation going growing up his he found his mom dead when he was 13 he was on acid yeah I mean sorry he was raised by his friends Fanny was sucking at it that night too was he yeah he was sucking some girl's tit on acid no he found his mom dead yeah Jesus yeah boy has some symbolism in that huh oh never once argument it was like oh good I guess I don't need anything better than this I still it's still my wife thank God I could not have married a woman that didn't have nice tits there's a lot of women out there with little tits that are angry at you right now I'm sorry you're not real women I'm kidding I'm kidding but I couldn't have married one I respect you and I'll hang out with you I'll let you in to my shows but I'm not gonna marry you if you get out of the itty-bitty titty committee early and you want to go see a comedy show now I look respect all women I just think I really all of them what about mean ones that kill people respect them even more they're fighting back they're mean they're me to hang out there huh you hear about the hashtag me too no you're gonna love this Joe Rogan no there's a thing now because of Harvey Weinstein there's a hashtag women that have been sexually harassed pound sign me to on their social media Jesus Christ and the and you sexually harassed I would say it's probably a hundred percent it yeah because it's a murky definition right you know I mean some of the stories that you hear and I look this Harvey Weinstein thing is atrocious and guys that are like that are the reason why guys like us have to watch what we say all the sensitivity that we've been talking about is because of a few at not a few assholes there's a lot of assholes but and it's not just I mean we're not talking about a person trying to get laid we're talking about a person who was holding employment over people right power and did you see the TMZ thing we're TMZ they were describing the nature of his contract that he had sexual assault and and her sexual harassment lawsuits written into the contract again like a waiver friend yeah how much he would be fined and for one one one person saying it it was a certain amount of money for two allegation oh no shit it was more for three it was like he was like 100 thousand to fifty seven fifty million Wow yeah written in like caps on how much he could have to pay know like how much they would pay him like you're or how much he would have to pay according to the contract if Weinstein treated someone improperly in violation of the company's code of conduct he must reimburse TWC for the settlements or judgments additionally you Weinstein will pay the company liquidated damages of $250,000 for the first such instance $500,000 for the second such instance 750 for the third and a million for each addition no instance just imagine that they wrote this in they're complicit they're all complicit there's another provision he can be fired for the purpose to perpetuate of your situation perpetuation that's a weird word yeah it is perpetuation Bayou wine scene of a material fraud against the company okay what does that mean the question where's the fraud Lance Maher off a board member who negotiated the Weinstein 215 2015 contract said in an interview and we've confirmed the board knew Weinstein had settled prior lawsuits brought by various women but they assumed it was to cover up consensual affair it was the board's assumption does not constitute fraud on Weinstein's part mmm scroll up let's keep going more surprisingly is how TWC fired Weinstein suppose Weinstein know Weinstein supposedly without giving a specific reason which could potentially violate the terms of the contract oh my god that's crazy here's the kicker even if Weinstein had committed fraud by not fully informing the Board of Directors the contract says before he can be fired he has the right to mediation if that doesn't work he's entitled to arbitration he got neither he was summarily fired and sources connected with Weinstein tell TMZ he was never given a specific reason Wow well he's fighting it yeah I love that where do you get the balls to fight back right now I guess he feels like there's the only way to sort of reclaim some ground yeah I mean is that a way to look at it well that's that mentality and you know at that level the power brokers that run Hollywood you know they're all fucking it's Trump is like that - it's all aggression it's all come at you when you come at them yeah I mean it's gotta be a crazy position to be in to be the head of Miramax ya know I mean it's like it's the biggest it's one of the biggest right what's the biggest what is the biggest studio if it's not Miramax it's one of our Universal Miramax so at the very least he's responsible for some of the most iconic movies ever yeah so certainly the most Oscars of any studio in the last 20 years so everyone's kissing his ass yeah massive amounts of power and this influence over people like royalty right mmm barks they all come you know everybody's at his whim constantly hmm and then tries to fuck all these starlets like if he had just stuck with like prostitutes probably still would come out but it wouldn't come out the same way it wouldn't come out you know things well think about the fact that they cover it up sexual assault on it sounds like a weekly basis I mean this this story broke what five days ago something like that and there's already so many women that have come out and now you've got a bounty on more women to come out like this summit I think that there's somebody else is offering a certain amount of money for every woman that comes out against him so it's gonna be like Cosby all over again and you think about but God but Cosby was drugging and raping right nobody just mean it's frequently another step more evil though right I'm just talking about like the frequency of it and and the complicity of people that set up the meetings you covered up to lawsuits oh yeah gave the women work after the meetings you know a lot of them got script deals got roles in movies because let's a lot of them didn't walk out of the room a lot of them gave him the back rub or whatever else yeah yeah yeah well that was what Whitney was talking about the other day Whitney Cummings was telling me her and one of her friends who's an actress I did their show at the Largo the other night and they were in the the greenroom and they were talking about how many women literally wrote into their contract like not wrote into it but there was an agreement that they would fuck him to get like editors cut they would fuck him to get more lines yeah yeah yeah girls like prominent actresses had sex with him to ensure that they got big roles this was written down some of it was agreed upon I don't know if they wrote it but these things were agreed upon and that he always kept his end of the bargain he was known she's known for hooking them up was part of how he got this whole thing to work which means every director an editor that kept those lines in knew because editors all the time word shot he chopped out whole scenes cuz they don't work yeah but that's only that's like saying like when did it happen did it happen before the film was shot like she would give them final cut like he would allow them to you know to be in the editing room or was it like I will give you the choice part mm-hmm whatever it was like some sneaky deal yeah who knows how he said it who knows how they did it yeah but the idea that all these actors are coming out like I have no idea I can't believe it I'm so horrified how do you not know that I'm a road comic and I knew about it yeah I'm not in the middle of Hollywood yeah I've known about it for 15 years what did you know I knew that he was a casting couch guy everybody knew that he was the sleazy fat I always would joke about how like I think he makes himself less attractive because it's more of a power trip for him it's more fun yeah yeah have his fat gut resting on their forehead while shoots a load in their mouth yeah yeah doesn't wash on purpose has his balls just stink like locker rooms yeah it's a weird thing man it's a weird thing that that's that went on for forever in this in this industry not this industry the music the movie industry the music industry as well Sturgill Simpson was telling me some story about some guy who's a known Petr asked who is like there's he's in a similar position in the music business and like people know like you can't have like young boys around this guy well he's some big-time powerful guy he told me the guys name I literally can't tell you who the fuck it was but he was saying like man there's there are people in the music business that are in this exact same situation like they fuck people to have them move on and move up and move forward especially back when radio was a big deal right radio and record sales were inexorably connected you could not sell records unless you get on the radio the only band that that managed to move through that was kiss kiss was primarily on the radio they were rarely on the radio but kiss had such a loyal following and they put together such an amazing show a live show that they they were selling millions of albums and got almost no radio time kidding selling out arenas yes no radio and they were like mocked yeah relentlessly by people who really loved rock yeah I never liked kiss but I respect what they've done I love kiss really oh yeah when I was a kid I loved them how many songs though do they really have fun good shitloads depends on if you like that kind of music yeah look I mean it's like if I compare it to Led Zeppelin hmm like in terms of like like the the style of music the depth of the composition of the music and the lyrics and you know if they don't have anything that's like a whole lot of love or any time yeah you know I mean there's like there's certain songs that are just on another level you know they don't have any of those yeah but they have fun songs you know they're a live band yeah they have great live shows yeah the live shows are great but and then some of their some of their song like Beth is a good song they have a bunch of good songs that are like uncharacteristic you know for like what you would think of when you think about kiss yeah but you know they had like this style of music it was like a fun party rock and roll great I think that the couple songs I know there's I like but when you think about the phenomenon that is kiss they really don't have the songs to support it like I feel like the same way I'm gonna get shit about saying this Aerosmith Aerosmith has like three of the greatest rock songs of all time like literally my top 50 rock songs on here three of them are Arab walked this way dream on dream on and mama can now sweet emoji sweet emotion those three are my top in my top 50 and then it ends then he got loving the elevator and all this shit that makes me go like I got to delete my files on this on these clowns why well you know what happened to them movies they started doing those movie anthems yeah should never do those movie anthems they did those like Armageddon soundtrack type things yeah well you know like just middle-of-the-road popcorn music from stupid blockbuster film they started trying to figure out what the audience wanted and giving it to them instead of being themselves I don't know I mean for whatever it is it's like you have two different schools of thought in that band you have Joe Perry who I know he's a great guy who doesn't give a fuck about Fame Joe Perry's like a guy from Boston who's just a badass guitarist who loves making rock and roll yeah it's awesome and then you got what Stephen time and Tyler who likes being famous yeah and he likes doing like Busey on America's Got Talent or one of those which one of those is he on yeah yeah this is just one season except but that kind of shit yeah did you imagine Robert Plant do an American Idol well I could imagine Mick Jagger doing something like that and Keith Richards Richards is like the what's that just a bank cheques just a bank checks but I think Mick Jagger and Keith Richards have a similar kind of situation Mick wanted to be famous Keith is just a badass rocker mmm maybe I don't know huh I mean look there's nothing wrong with wanting to be famous if that's what you're into hmm but when the music suffers or the music changes you know yeah we go from sweet emotions to some like nonsensical moron ballad that literally like it may it hurts your feelings yeah you listen to some of those ballads and you just like alright Billy Joel's like that mm-hmm he's got some of the greatest fucking Sun remember the last time we shot pool we listen to a few Billy Joel's yes and then you've got uptown girl I've got a Billy Joel ethereal talk she's getting so angry I know exactly what happen Christie Brinkley yeah too hot yeah ugly little guy from Long Island all sudden he's banging this supermodel that bitch is hot today she's like yeah he's hot as fuck yeah she's like the hottest 64 year old woman on the planet yeah have you seen pictures of her I just played I bowled with her recent shut up yep no you know look you see that's when they were together that's when he lost his marbles yeah that's when it was usually she looks fucking beautiful so where was this Venice she bowls in Venice yeah and that crazy that she's in her 60s and you would bang her right would you just because he fucked her you fucked him cuz he fucked her yeah I wouldn't go that far but do you think I would I would worry that she would break because she's 64 he'd send it home here cracking in her hips who's that her I like it in the water how's that possible how'd she look so hot and so many women fall oh no I didn't see Christie frankly this aw Cindy Crawford I bowled you son of a bitch you just like Jamie oh my God look at her butt oh that's not her I was like that's insane oh these are dog whoa let's pick it up know the hugging some bitch in bikini it was her but oh come on that was a little that's a little sex but see that's the thing I did I don't think you can have a nice 64 year old ass I think yeah every picture is like from the front and notice the bent leg to kind of hide anything well they all do that so now she is hot as fuck right but look you don't see your butt good Google Christie Brinkley's but listen you're objectifying women no I'm just trying to I'm doing an anatomical survey or something something oh that's a famous shot yeah but that's like that's her Sports Illustrated shot Christie Blinky's but but at 60 well either way she's done a remarkable job of staying attractive very proud and I guess what that is is just constant effort right and maybe some surgery but at the very lot of DNA involved too right must be yeah yeah but constant effort right like constant gym time watching the diet you know a lot of water no grates you know and also they have figured all the best skin care products yeah I mean that's the business you know that's her business it's what's super shocking is when a woman was like just some mocking heart and then she just lets it go just lets a girl a Kathleen Turner dete are today she could be Joey Diaz a star level would you have sex with a just to say you had sex Kathleen Turner though what do you think now oh look at that picture wow dude she was fucking some okay she had that voice but I feel like there's a health issue she's so big it doesn't make sense yeah a lot of times you know they have to take a steroid for something and they blow up from the steroid oh Jesus is that real you make that bigger see I think it's probably alcohol - hmm when you see someone that big it's like well you have to eat a lot of food to stay that big yeah unless you're boozing it like I know this lady she works out all the time but she boozes all the time maybe she just can't her legs are always like just thick yeah weird yeah fuck yeah the fucking empty calories and booze yeah for people who drink like everyday those everyday drinkers man that's a that's a fucking want you're drunk you you're not a real health nut about what you eat pizza and fucking and then when you wake up in the morning feel like shit yeah eat more shit yeah oh soompi I don't know maybe Kathleen Turner maybe she made so much money and her natural body is big and she just went fuck it I'm gonna enjoy my life and not suffer like Kathleen like Christie Brinkley that sounds like something a woman who got really big would say no one's natural bodies overweight that's just not that if you're doing it's because you're eating the wrong food you're not exercising you're definitely overeating and you're most likely drinking like that's that's not someone who's thick that's you know that's a obese woman yeah I mean that's that's we'll get her dude she was hottest yeah whoo she was hot was that movie body heat with her and uh was that Jeff Bridges or William Hurt he's from Romancing the Stone oh that was like a rip off of indianna jones right with Michael Douglas yeah it was like Michael Douglas was like the Indiana Jones character but it was kind of like a semi comedy Romancing the Stone yeah it was like he was the archaeologist godhardt hard to remember are they made a lot of shitty movies back then yeah a romantic Estelle trying to go back and watch those things you'd be like what I know they were so dated here see working girl lately what's that it was Melanie Griffith and she played a girl from Staten Island who like is a secretary at a law firm and she's a paralegal or something no even an agency yes Wow no that's not her that's Melanie Griffith is it oh yeah yeah because you know who else has got the big hair on this movie is Joan Joan Cusack yeah she is yeah so they're supposed to like girls from Long Island or something yeah and they're working at the fancy Manhattan office but they're like the gumshoe and cigarette-smoking like that's real and then she she she Bluffs her way up oh it's a great fucking movie but it's so the fashion and the hair is sincerity believer she was hot yes back in the alien days yeah she was so hot it's a rough world man look at Harrison Ford handsome bastard it's weird that we're watching these people age to like the point of decay right in front of us because that really wasn't a thing until about 50 years ago if you really stopped you never got to see that you never got to see someone age in front of you like that right like in he'll mean 50 years maybe no maybe a little bit more maybe let's get generous 7080 years like this is a new cultural phenomena to have visual evidence of decay that you go over with a fine-tooth comb and never like this where I could say hey pull that shit up Jamie yeah let's take a look at Kathleen Turner when she was young whoa oh yeah I'm sure if didn't was that before after pictures they're already smashed together in some photos for sure and it's like no you look at like Betty Davis she got to a certain age and then she just went okay I'll be in my mansion lock it up behind me I'll see you at my funeral you know they just crawl out of the way like a pigeon that got injured or Elizabeth Taylor she's kept marrying new gay guys some new obviously gay guys does she know like what what's happening she was like 70 they were like 45 year old gay guys whoa 1983 Smirnoff with Betty Davis and add Oh Jim Beam two of a kind of original squad and I say oh smirnoff vodka Wow who was that the other one Diane what does our name where it says in the ad right there 83 smirnoff vodka with the woman's name Carol who's Diane Kara what a weird way spelled I am bi aah a and n maybe she's a photographer maybe she's a lot of work she likes to change the spelling her name be crafty there's a lot of Diane's dia Eddie I'm not a lot of women I'm very and you get mad when you correct people yes dih eight and yeah if you like read it out dum dee Han Diane my name is Diane but why don't you spell it Diane crazy bitch that's a phonetic language yeah ooh Oh Oh from dynasty there's a new dynasty apparently oh good there's an ad it's hilarious it's a billboard and in the billboard this like this guy and a couple pretty women behind him and one of the pretty women has her tongue out like this like like showing you a little her tongue that's something that unless you're a rock star men just don't do like men never take a picture try like sex and Lords I say yeah right yeah look look at her tongue oh yeah picture like what is its first of all it's on the CW which I don't even know if I have there's certain channels like I didn't even know I don't have epics DirecTV doesn't have epics hmm as I tried to watch someone special in epic sounds like oh I don't have that fucking thing see that one bitch is pulling the other bitches hair hung out like yeah you wanna buy a stick my tongue out to care to lick the tip of dicks like what is that like who told her to stick her tongue out like that yeah baby perfect perfect I like it what if they didn't will if they photoshopped her tongue out there and she got the photos she's like what the fuck is this stupid shit yeah what have my tongue out it's just the editor made a choice or an artistic choice this is the new like kiss kiss face the selfie face was the one who just pulled up that gay picture you just pulled up oh there's a bunch of guys all the guys are fighting that black guys can kick that white guys ask while we were pretending he's not you know he's eyeballing him then what buck guys gonna fuck that white guy up I can tell by looking at their faces yeah that's true do you find that with MMA you can you can tell them the weigh-ins and all that nope who's got an edge definitely can't now you think you can you're off and wrong yeah you can't you can't tell there's a lot of guys that look like doughboys and but they can fight yeah they just know how to fight in it's also they know how to endure sometimes guys when they don't look physically impressive have had to deal with so many people fucking with them their whole life that they develop this sort of like werewolf personality like where they can just go oh yeah motherfucker and then they just keep coming they keep coming at you and they just never then they never get discouraged yeah and those guys like a lot of times guys are not physically gifted they have incredible work ethic because they have to because that's the only way they can compete and so they like they'll slowly break guys down just with toughness mm-hmm the problem with those guys is they take a liqu stream beating right here right and it's not sustainable and then one day they run into a guy was both like see there's discipline and there's talent and a lot of times talented people don't have discipline and you know you just wish they did because then they'd be the greatest ever well the greatest ever are the guys with talent and discipline mm-hmm like Anderson Silva or someone like that like talented but also like physically superior just moves faster and then also works incredibly hard right and then also can perform under pressure and knows how to come back from behind like no zetas knows that turned around when he's getting his ass kicked yeah that's a third aspect it's like you have to have this psychological you have to be able to take it you have to be able to be the hammer or the nail right you gotta be able to be the nail yeah the guys can't be the nail they start getting hit on they like fuck this I gotta get out yeah yeah yeah and some guys are great in there like that some so there's some great fighters that just can't take a beating yeah it's a very strange fighting is the weirdest of all like sports because it's not really a sport it may kind of is it's an athletic endeavor but it's so much more emotional intense than just a regular sport like calling it a sport mm-hmm it's just something there's so much more to it smart personal you've taken off to the bathroom Jamie I can't handle it Jamie can't handle it now we don't get to see him sneak around behind you anymore we have a new setup yeah you should have a camera in the bathroom yeah you get sued for that oh yeah you ever hear about Chuck Berry yes this was the same dude that came out that was another thing I knew I had heard rumors and again am I in the fucking music industry I had heard rumors that Chuck Berry had hours and hours of footage of women pissing and shitting and that he had cameras hidden in the toilet seats of his restaurant in Illinois the shit for years and then all sudden it came out in the news and there was a class-action lawsuit that I believe he lost I should say I should say all of this with supposedly unless I don't get sued allegedly well he's dead you can get away with how is he dead but I mean it's amazing that this shit is out there Bill Cosby I knew that Bill Cosby molesting women so did you yes we I knew it because when I was on the set of news radio people knew him from whatever thing and that was always the thing that Bill Cosby drugs women yeah and I had heard it like what he does yeah like it was always some weird thing I never met him but I don't anything I knew someone who had been around him I think it was just like one of those things where people just knew yeah he just knew like that Michael Jackson was probably diddling kids we knew it because we knew no well that's the thing that's coming up what do we know did we know somebody yeah who'd we know we knew somebody who was sent a boy to the ranch what who's we I don't want to say on the air who it is somebody in the industry but when you say we knew like who's we you and I me yeah I did not know someone who sent a boy to there unless I didn't know they sent a boy to the ranch maybe you didn't know you didn't know I'll tell you off the air Jesus Christ what about all these people that are listening that's right now I know we shouldn't have brought it up yeah you shouldn't have son of a bitch no you think all these people out there don't know they're all hanging on a thread like what who was it yeah well I think it's one of the reasons why we like really good stuff too right because we can't imagine being able to do that okay like when you see someone who's like playing like you see like Gary Clark jr. something playing guitar on stage mesmerizing right damn that guy's good right holy shit you know there's something about watching someone who's mesmerizing that's equally captivating it's watching someone who's awful yeah look at um what's-his-name from Queen mercury Freddie Mercury yeah I mean that guy fucking went for it he went for it back in the day when no one even knew he was gay yeah they didn't understand like what a gay front man was right like now you could be a gay front man now like Elton John is openly gay mm-hmm everyone knows it he goes out there and sings and everybody goes nuts and yeah back then he when we stadium with a mustache sticking out and a leather vest we champions yeah but you got to think he must have gone that big when they were playing bars and saloons on their way up he must have been going big yeah yeah yeah where it probably looked ridiculous but certain people got it well he's so good yeah that even when he was doing those bars people must have heard that voice and went holy shit listen to this guy alright cuz he could carry a fucking note look at that picture oh really that's not him wow that guy looks amazingly like ask oh well sure his name is telling it ramie malik actor's name who's Brian J singer huh that guy I don't know I think Sasha Baron Cohen wanted that role really yeah they probably have nailed it yep I wonder why they didn't give it to him I mean it's almost like he booby did you see that was it Live Aid where they were simulcasting from London and Philadelphia at the same time scroll up scroll up there and he fuckin stole the shell that's him for real yeah Live Aid where Sasha Baron Cohen stole the show who do you know where Freddie Mercury did know it was back in 84 ish when did he die I don't know he was like one of the first big names to die of AIDS yeah well you heard about anyone what right fucked up man anyone 8191 anyone nobody dies of AIDS now it's a very rare yeah I don't say nobody but it's saying like nobody dies of syphilis you still can but ya mean did you hear the California just recently reduced the penalty of not telling someone that you have HIV today yeah like wantonly infecting someone with HIV is no longer a felony why the guy who introduced it the the senator there's a fucking picture of them new Californian law reduces penalty for knowingly exposing someone to HIV why the fuck would you do that HIV is a public health issue not a criminal issue California State Senator Scott Weiner said in support of the bill which takes now google that guy and find a picture of him with his shirt off with a leather vest on a six-pack and a dog collar on his yeah and I'm not kidding I'm not kidding like there's there's a fucking image of him that's him but he's jacked there's but there's a photo oh yeah it's someone yeah look at this sorry not a dog collar he's got a leather tie wrapped around his neck might as well be a dog collar but look at this this is the guy I mean if he's not gay he's certainly sympathetic to the cause and this is the guy that's supporting this bill saying that HIV is a health issue no it's not a health issue if you fucking knowingly give it to somebody if you knowingly shoot a hot load into someone knowing you have HIV you get back from the doctor doctor says Greg I've got some bad news for you you got the hip and you're like well I got some bad news forever I'm shooting loads too yes I'm not gonna tell him I like shooting loads into people I don't like condoms hmm like you're doing a criminal act it's it's a deadly weapon your semen is a deadly weapon not today if you get treatment but what if someone doesn't like doctors yeah what if they're afraid of doctors there's a lot of people that are afraid they're afraid of going to the doctor so if they don't go to the doctor HIV turns into AIDS they died of AIDS you fucking gave it to him man how is that not a felony all right who would want to reduce that crime who would want to reduce the crime of knowingly exposing someone to a death-dealing disease a disease that's killed untold hundreds of thousands if not millions of people worldwide right you know the numbers it's probably Millions right yeah why would you do that like who's clamoring for that to be reduced well think about how many guys are what are they call it on the down-low where they go out and they have sex with men get sick and then have sex with their wives a lot of wives get AIDS or HIV right get HIV yeah yeah that's it's a that's one of those diseases where they essentially found a cure for it right they have a treatment and that treatment reduces it to the point where it's not even you can't even detect it in the blood anymore oh it's that good oh yeah it's undetectable like Magic Johnson said that Jesus did it for him Jesus made made my HIV go away no longer detectable that is so cool Magic Johnson accent it's horrible impression but yeah they literally have gotten to the point where it's undetectable what does it say number of deaths due to HIV AIDS estimates by country there was a million last year but it has no data for the United States yeah see the thing about that is and this is how it's been explained to me so I'm sure if someone will correct me if I'm wrong the problem with this distinction and this is one of the real problems with the way they used it to describe Africa they were saying all these people in Africa get AIDS and die well this doctor was telling me and he's completely off the record he was telling me that progressives very smart liberal guys like okay he goes what you're talking about is people with extremely compromised immune systems that's from a variety of different reasons he goes dude they're not getting HIV tests he goes use these people in these really poor areas in Africa this is you know we're talking like early 2000s he's like they're not keeping these people HIV tests they're not flying to Africa and administering these expensive tests on these people he's like these people have extremely compromised immune systems they check their t-cell count their t-cell counts very low they're very unhealthy and so they say they have AIDS mm-hmm and that's how you get funding the way you get funding is you say there's a million cases of AIDS in Africa you don't get funding when you say there's a million cases of people who are malnourished who have a host of horrific diseases unacceptable that we're trending to 50 percent of African American gay bi men having HIV must end this health disparity why oh that's that's Wiener that's the guy his name's Weiner which is hilarious now their Weiner another Weiner but unacceptable that we're trending to 50% of african-american gay bi men having HIV meanwhile he says must end this health disparity and the best way to end it is to reduce the penalty from knowingly giving it mm-hmm all right I don't want to say that he has it and he just wants to like make it a little easier on himself but it's why would you do that like why would you want to reduce that even Benjamin had a great tweet about it yeah allowed Charlie something about allowing Charlie Sheen to California's allowing Charlie Sheen to paint have less of a penalty for having unprotected sex with unsuspecting young women you fucking psychos yeah like that yeah well it's you know the question is can you legislate behavior right can you it's a situation can you leg do you want to write do you want to legislate behavior hmm or do you want people to just be like but you have to punish people for why like if if you have some sort of an incurable disease aids obviously is curable or HIV is right at least at this point it's it treatable shouldn't say curable but if you have something like what would be okay like here's a perfect example remember when that woman came back from Africa and they suspected that she had been exposed to Ebola people were freaking the fuck out because she was wandering around she's like I'm not I'm not gonna be quarantined fuck off mm-hmm and they're like this bitch is a monster right that's much more communicable than HIV is I guess but not much difference in terms of like what it can do and you're talking about something that kills people right it's kind of the same thing in a lot of ways but we we tend to look past things that are sexually transmitted because like wow don't get fucked you don't have any problems you know don't do anything that Jesus wouldn't want you to do mm-hmm and you have any issues what do you take it in the ass you fucking piece of shit really you horrible person yeah no no it's like now with there they're allowing companies to not have to cover women's birth control and it's like they want to shame they want to shame people from having sex it's the same thing with you know not paying for abortions do you really think that's what it is I think orgasms are free and they and the the the haves the fucking drives me crazy I don't think that's what it is I think it's a financial issue I think if you look behind it I bet there's probably insurance companies that are involved in this there's probably a lot of people that look if you're if you have to pay or companies like if a company has to pay for your employees birth control pills and you have a hundred thousand employees how many birth control pills you paying for mmm that's a lot of money I mean and you go across the board and also you set a precedent if you have to pay for that maybe you have to pay for something that comes along it's similar to for men or some other issue that women might have that has to be covered I think it's all financial we defensive though to have women missing work for pregnancies firearm fuck'em it's kind of a weird thing right it's cuz because if somebody works for you they don't just work for you right we are assuming that person is dependent upon you so one of the weirder things about employment it's like that's not just someone who works for you you have to take care of that person you're supposed to provide them with insurance you're supposed to provide them with benefits you're supposed to allow them to you know take time off and it's a weird thing because we're like we've settled into the idea that this person is completely dependent upon their employment you know I think um like this idea that if a woman has a child that you have to give her maternity leave we have to pay her while she has the baby and that you have to maybe pay child support or some sort of child care while she has the baby that people really want that they want that it's part of it because people the way people live in this country in particular and we just assume that you have to live this way because we compare ourselves to people that live in like indigenous tribes or in third-world countries where they don't have unemployment and they don't have high overhead right rent bills all the different things that we have but we have like this system set up or once you're in the system once you start making that money you need that money and when the kid comes you can't just quit work like no one does that anymore like we don't think anyone should do that anymore we assume that woman is eventually gonna go back to work so she's gonna get a maternity leave because the company values her as an employee and then once she's done with her maternity leave maybe there'd be some other sort of compensation or some sort of and she definitely won't be working any long hours or overtime anymore I just got to get home and take care of her kid that's the hidden thing in the whole argument against the financial the difference in the amount of money like income disparity between men and women but the big one one of the big ones is the number of hours that women are willing to work there's a series of choices right there's the the the jobs they gravitate towards there's the number of hours that they're willing to work there's taking time off when they have children and another one of the big ones is this is one that works sort of against them that doesn't get discussed when men are trying to say that the income inequality thing is all bullshit women are not as good at negotiating for a better salary they're not as aggressive in negotiating for a better salary and even if they do just as good a jobs the man now that's the one area where they sort of seem to fall behind where it's like a rational distinction that a woman is doing the same job as a man and not getting paid as well because when you look at the income inequality between men and women you know it's like 77% cents on the dollar it's really not real it's not like they're working the same job next to each other yeah you were telling me it's because that mental work more dangerous jobs to tend to pay more yeah more dangerous jobs tend to pay more men are much more likely to die on the job it's it's much more likely to get injured on the job there's a bunch of fields that men gravitates toward gravitate towards that are particularly just interesting and attractive to men that women don't gravitate towards and if they do it's in lower numbers and this obviously these are gross generalizations because there's women who are MMA writers write a lot of them I mean I see him all the time not a lot of them would a few so it's like people are you know you can't like just pigeonhole people you know there's a lot of men that are florists right this is you can't it's very difficult to just like say a man is this and a woman is that because there's trends obviously is for sure trends right and to deny those trends seems to be this the state of discourse today people like to deny those those trends and write any accepting of those trends is some sort of accepting of this systemic oppression of women or systemic oppression of gay people or it's very that woman who wrote that book lean in I think it was a lot about that like negotiate you know it shouldn't be mandated you should be able to go in and fight for your salary and get a better salary fight for the corner office you know and don't don't wait for it to be handed to you because the patriarchal system is not going to suddenly just make things fair but it's a patriarchal system real is there a patriarchal system to be Weinstein I mean okay that's a different thing because that's a power issue right and when you when you have absolute power like that guy had and you're also a fat ugly fuck yeah and you realize this is a way to get going of Paltrow suck my dick you know is this that's and that's a unique situation but also but I think the dynamic of it is that since men do obviously quantifiably have more power positions on the boards of companies and management partners that women are intimidated by that they're intimidated to go up against it I think there's also a thing where women don't want to be a bitch right yeah they like men don't view a woman who's aggressive the same way they view a man as aggressive like if you and I were working in the office and you're like always hustling and getting ahead and always like fighting for what's yours like Greg's Greg's an agressive motherfucker he gets shit done yeah but if a woman is doing the exact same thing that fucking bitch I don't want to be around her she's such a bitch you know a woman who exhibits the same sort of aggressive tendencies is it's negative yeah whereas the guy's an ass-kicker right right you know Tamara who is the comic up in Boston who had that she's like every comic had one great joke in this guy's joke was behind every successful man there's a woman and behind every successful woman of two guys calling her a lesbian fuck was that remember that guy he was kind of yet wire-rimmed glasses he's a little bit chubby goddamn do you remember that joke though I do remember it now you said it I'm just tryin remember Harley who was gonna give him a shout-out if he's still doing it I always wonder about like if guys like that are still doing it I wonder if they do do it like they just do it every now and then and their job right look if you have a regular job and you like go out on the weekends do a dick Doherty gig here and there pick up 300 bucks over the weekend chug it fuck it and you know and have a good time have a good time get some free drinks maybe if you're single maybe you meet a woman I mean what better way to meet women then getting on stage for you know if these guys are doing 20 minutes or a half hour and they get offstage and mingle yeah better than fucking what go into a beefsteak Charlie's standing at the bar looking at a rusted trombone on the wine Denine ordering some wings and a beer and looking around creeping people out hey yeah who are you from what we got and for a man to try to stand out it's such a grind for a guy to stand down that's why guys peacock right you wearing like big watches and rings and driving a fancy car just trying to [Applause] cause we're gross we're gross women are beautifully you don't see statues of men you do statues weak statues yeah men that don't look like us hmm yeah a little different yeah and maybe a little that maybe a little of that someone had a great joke the other day he was like the Greeks invented the difference between the Greeks and Italians the Greeks invented making love the Italians did it to women well I was thinking when we were think I of course told me that joke we were both in Italy last summer and it's like looking at those statues of the men and they're like they're fucking beautiful like their abs are just perfect and and then they have dicks and it's so weird because if you had a statue that's that realistic like The Grove some Christian would cloak it and they'd carted off because it was too too graphic yeah and you got to think like when you when you're the sculptor and you're putting that much effort where the dick has like a slightly bent shaft and the you can see the crown and there's almost like a slit at the tip of the it's like after a couple days you got to look at the fifth a discovery like okay everything you got it yeah there's a puddle of drool on the ball while he's working on the shaft well there's two different things that are interesting about Dick's in those ancient Roman times one thing is that the original the early days these took days to have just the cock hanging out then they came a period of time where they started because of some religious influence they started covering them with leaves and that was like after the fact and they they actually added leaves his dick under there yeah some of them Wow and then they start they started doing some statues where they put the leaf over the dick like as they were constructing it but they did retrofit some some statues for dicks but here go back to that again real quick these pictures of dicks whole and here's what's interesting about these dicks you look at these guys and he's like big athletic looking like wrestler characters they all have little dicks and one of the reasons why they had little dicks is because in this time of I mean this is my interpretation of it right and this is what I had a really good professor that took us on a tour in Rome of the Vatican it was we got super lucky well we hired a professor that he was fantastic and he loved that I knew a lot about ancient history particularly like their use of drugs so like we were talking about the giant pinecone that's in the middle of the Vatican they have this outdoor area with a big pine cone and he goes and he goes do you know what that represents I go that's the pineal gland that heals how do you know and then we started talking and we started talking about like drugs and you know endogenous production of dimethyltryptamine and shit like no shit then he and I like we fucking ignored my family hands and wandering through the vatican together but as this guy was explaining that I go why they're dicks all so little and he goes that's a very good question and he said that a large dick was thought to be like a gross primitive thing like this like to have a large dick you were like a non evolved thing and hidden when you think about how close these people were to cave people right like you're thinking about a thousand two thousand years ago right go back two thousand years before that and what the fuck do you have you know I mean you have ancient Egypt and a few but you have essentially like small villages 2,000 years before that you don't have the wheel okay so you're you're talking about the wheel I believe goes back somewhere around fifty five hundred years ago the first evidence of the wheel that is super recent right so these people were essentially realizing that there's a better way like now we have Rome we have sophistication we have art we have culture we have music and wine and we're not gonna go back to those big dick ways this is mashing heads and just fucking like wild animals yeah and I think when they thought of like the barbarian hordes that would come and and you know it's fuckin rape and pillage they probably thought those big fat juicy dicks or one of the reasons why there was so horrible and so so base and vile and primitive and these big hogs and smashing skulls and raping and killing they were trying to move past that and one way that they tried to express that was in their art this sophisticated incredibly anatomically correct art and they all had these little tiny baby divs and these baby dicks were supposed to represent like culture and sophistication sort of like how a fat woman was supposed to represent like a woman who ate a lot right as a woman of culture so they were attractive like look at that guy he's built like Brock Lesnar and he's got a dick like pee-wee Herman like look at that I don't know if you were here has a little bit I always thought it was because over time the dick must have just got knocked off and that's why so small no no they purposely represented these gigantic muscular men as having tiny penises which showed sophistication so they were almost in this like transitionary period of like the muscles were big the body was obviously like very primal you know they were they're obviously like very fit but they had these little tiny cocks and Wow what they would they admired if that holds I wonder if that translates to the myth that the african-american man has a big penis goes to that is movies lacked calm this is a website it's called black family yeah there's a couple porn stars that have followed on Twitter and they'll just like post like that's the weird thing about Twitter sometimes I'll forget that I've followed porn stars I'm going through my Twitter feed and like oh there's a dick and an ass like just I don't know where there's a girl like taking a hot way a face like this like Twitter there's one of the things that I actually love about Twitter Twitter in a lot of ways is still wild you know I I think they're trying to get a hold of it I'm trying to get Jack from Twitter the head guy on the podcast we've been going back and forth and oh yeah he's expressed some interest about it but a little trepidation he's a little worried about how to because they're trying to censor people but the people they're trying to censor or the people that are actively harassing people the people that are using unwanted sexual advances and sending unwanted naked photos and things on those lawns to people right offending elections that's a little different here's something I thought was fantastic fashion ating I fucking I retreated it and accidentally Unruh tweeted and then I couldn't find it she never do things on my computer when it's like late at night and I'm barely paying attention but someone posted something that this person that was claiming they were from Rhode Island posted the tweeting about Hillary Clinton it was like in response to something that Donald Trump had done really recently and it was fucked up and about Hilary and our deleted emails and they left their location on and it was Russia oh no there's tons of that there's tons yeah yeah a lot of these unknown accounts it was like heaven underscore or 2012 or something like that but a lot of these accounts where these people are attacking Hillary Clinton and like supporting Trump and these like right wing talking points hmm we literally have to understand this isn't just a this isn't just a trope this isn't a just like some weird talking point that Democrats keep using there are thousands and thousands of fake internet accounts that are designed to attack people that are supporting someone who's in opposition of their interest and to support someone who is on their side yeah and these are these people these online whether they're real people or whether they're bots they're all pro Trump all of them and they're all pro Trump and a lot of them are like stoking the racial tell yeah oh yes that helps that helped Trump get elected oh of course of course and it's just it's fascinating that people are denying this you know that a lot of people on the right are denying this and saying oh the Democrats are just you know whining and you lost get over it I've seen a lot of that you lost get over it you got to understand what's happening here you're not necessarily dealing with real discourse it's not really the right and the left communicating staying each other's points debating no there's a bunch of people that don't have a fuck they're not even here yeah and they're pretending that they're here yeah and they're talking shit about the left and they're talking shit about Anthony Weiner or Hillary Clinton they're not even necessarily real people mm-hmm they might be but they might just be people that maybe they might just have scripts that they send out from hundreds of different accounts they might be looking for key words like there's a weird information war going on right now and an influencer war going on right now and there's a lot of people that don't want to admit it's real mm-hmm it's fucking a hundred percent real it's 100 percent real I mean Facebook has really gotten rid of thousands of accounts because they found that they were Russian accounts yeah and the ads that were being taken out on Facebook were they tracked the money they were ads that were bought by Russian I don't know if was the government or just the oligarchs but they were purchasing ads on Facebook what is this the best Twitter tool and you can buy just Google real quick tell me what this is it's all the stuff you can buy it's it's called tweet attacks Pro comm is designed to run thousands of Twitter accounts at the same time 24/7 to auto follow unfollow follow back tweet retweet reply favorite delete tweet under eat wheat unfavorite so they just do everything every account can have its own setting thus preventing Twitter from becoming suspicious about the account plus the software can simulate human operation perfectly exclamation points seven dollars so you buy this for seven dollars and you just go on a goddamn Greg Fitzsimmons promoting rampage I wonder we notice at the bottom the syntax designed for everyone's need that's not an American writing that no not limited by the Twitter API because we don't use it exclamation point okay we should do an experiment we should buy that and see how much we can jack up your Twitter account I love it like what's your Twitter account at right now I don't know what's great great Fitzsimmons fits dog radio not a lot 85,000 I wonder if we could get you up to like a quarter million in like a couple of months a million a million by the end that might get noticed I think that's if as long as we're really open about what we're doing I think that would be really a fascinating experiment you know and how do you do it well we use these things and then we we buy you a bunch of fake accounts right I mean not fake accounts fake followers we get we just use it you can get fake followers right how's that work like I checked the other day how many of my followers were fake I swear to god it was the exact same feeling I had when I took a HIV test in 93 I was like woo here we go I kind of enjoy looking at the number of followers I have they were all Russian Box not my words almost all real but the the number of that the president has is like 50% like 50% counts yeah I wonder if he did that I wonder if he hired or if they just follow him because he's the president and it's a good thing to have like a fake account following the president especially these Russian troll accounts I think this came up I feel like the first time when John Kerry was running against Obama and they found out they did like a Twitter auto and his accountant found out he had a recent influx of like a million followers on his account and really like what did he do it or did someone just do it to him well I think people if I was running a campaign and I was already a sleazy piece of shit running a presidential campaign or some sort of political campaign you got to think they're gonna use every tool at their disposal for us that's what they do right when they muckrake and they fucking go after people and pull out some shit from their past and make up some shit about their past and use every influence they have like look I think it's a good thing that we found out that Donald Trump is kind of guy that wants to talk about hey just grab them by the pussy you know it's a good that we know oh this is how he really talks and behaves but make no mistake about it that came about through dirty pool like they've went and searched and did their best in the know people that work at Access Hollywood or wherever and they tried to find out you know what do we got what do we got on it we got to get something what can I give you to give me this gonna recorder and I was talking about grabbing posters Oh Bobby if you can get me that I will get something for you yeah I mean this is all like how these people do this if you don't think they would get fake accounts you carry shit yeah no I know a lot of comedians that have done that that have built up too because club owners look at that show yeah for sure where they book you and come up with how much they're gonna pay you they quantify you yeah like what do you think what do you think we'd have to do to get Gregg up to a million what do you have to do do you got to talk to the microphone i listened to the podcast recently and sometimes you have it off you because i have the mic off to my house i don't know i understand but i was listening to it i couldn't understand a word your son would get up on the mic did get up on that bitch i'll try to eat it yes decide eats that shit i don't know exactly on this particular one this one wants you to pay a fee per month there's other ones you can pay like a one-time fee and whatever you're asking to happen what just happened over just happen is it doesn't happen instantly but i've show a couple YouTube videos doing what you're describing they did it to an employee of theirs without telling i'm like watched her Instagram account what happened today and luckily I got 2,000 new likes today I usually get 20 it's um he started felt like popular or whatever graining yeah get excited yeah yeah wonder what we get you up to give me a budget I can figure it give you a budget okay what do you think how much we need to spend 100 bucks 500 bucks 500 bucks could do a lot there's a I know a girl who did that and she went from like 30,000 followers to a million on Instagram do you want to also bump up your links modify numbers or your YouTube numbers or anything like that because you can do that as well I mean Instagram the girl did it on Instagram the way they found out the people is not in our business it's in another business but the way they found out that she was doing it was because the amount of likes that she got was the same the amount of like likes her images God the amount of comments they remain the same we didn't go on I wasn't portion right like if you see a like have you put something up on like okay let's for instance that picture that we put of you when we first started this podcast alright we did that you know a couple of hours ago right and we'll go to it right now and it has 17 thousand nine hundred and thirteen likes and 257 comments that's that means that's normal yeah that makes sense right it's like a photo of a funny comedian first episode on new podcast Ollie's there you go there it is right there look at you sexy bitch I put up yours the picture you do in the exact same pose 2,048 but that all makes sense so now if you have what's going on with you with the the other one with the you and the the dentist was that photo oh I just got my wisdom teeth pulled out the other day no you yeah oh Jesus yeah yeah oh god dude what happened was it getting impacted no I it had a filling in it and I guess I've cracked you will I you know I have ADHD so the doctor gives to the last like seven or eight years I've been on like ritalin and it makes me grind my teeth and I ground my crack into my Jesus Christ dude so he went in with some pliers and and it took like two seconds I thought it was gonna be like you know they're having like its foot on my far head and sweating and pulling it he just went in popped it out and threw some gauze on it I did three shows that night no way no problem really some people have like a week-long bad reaction to it I got lucky nothing just pop right out now and so what do they do now they put a like a crown in there or something it's a wisdom tooth they just leave it out oh no shit yeah so it's got like but you have to keep rinsing with salt water otherwise you get a infection the dry hole or something they could because your bone underneath is exposed because you need a blood clot to get in there and if the blood clot doesn't form then your bone is exposed and your breath apparently becomes like a fucking nightmare and you get an infection and you'll get a pain all the way through your ear and it happens to like 5% of people to get their wisdom teeth taken out do you know that people that get mouth infections oftentimes get heart attacks because of them I've heard that yeah what the fuck man you would think you just have bad breath ya know you could die dude what are you doing somebody you know well has bad Brella do you fuck you've done that yes no tell me - yeah tell me I'll tell you my breath stinks sometimes I drink a lot of coffee that's my downfall might as well you also have to brush your tongue man shoot on goodbye an account that had 240,000 plus followers that's over five years old for 150 bucks oh but that's all a whole account taking over the account but when you switch the name your followers wouldn't know the difference well I was an account I was following it must have been some meme account I just noticed that it switched to like booty pics or that's not to it merges so it'd be the same thing instead of having 85,000 like tomorrow he will have 250,000 yeah but they wouldn't be the same followers right I think it makes it blends them together oh so he adds those followers it's weird what happens when that goes down so you would add additional 250,000 followers so 240,000 followers I mean I'm into that apparently when you eat um a ketogenic diet which I'm on it's like uh you'd eat low carb you know high fat diet it makes your breath smell like fucking shit oh yeah yeah so I'm pretty conscious into that I'm pretty aware I was it a lot of meat yeah yeah cuz the meat doesn't digest as fast it's just fat burning I see I did your body burns fat as a fuel instead of protein or excuse me it said of carbohydrates yeah like the standard American diet we eat a lot of refined carbohydrates breads pastas things along those lines and what I try to do is lean to a much more fat based diet a lot of coconut a lot of avocado meat things along those lines I don't have very much carbs my carb intake is pretty low except when I go off the rails I'll go off the rails like maybe once a week or so I'll have like pasta or something like that you know not pizza I haven't had pizza in a while that's my super off-the-rails food that's that's when you're in New York for a couple days a full pizza yeah and then just feel like a fucking slob yeah just so discuss it's amazing what I'm willing to do for mouths pleasure just for that long second or gasps so trashed and then you just feel like shit for hours yeah like the taste only lasts for like 20 minutes but so what I'm willing to sacrifice hours of health well what do you sacrifice for an orgasm when you're single mmm the amount of booze that you'll buy a girl and conversation you listen to and yeah but that doesn't have all Pharaon ii orgasm the only downside is you fuck someone you don't really like and then you have to talk to them yeah those brutal days all right brew you know what the most brutal move was ever when I was young and stupid you would go on a vacation with a girl that you didn't really know though or invite her to come out with you on the road like a I'm working in Philadelphia this weekend yeah and uncle chuckles fucker fast fuckin and you would should have them come with you and you know an an hour after you came you couldn't deal with them you just like I can't believe I did this like you thought it was the perfect idea we'll get together we'll have some fun I'll take her to dinner we'll have because she can come to see my shows and back then man like people didn't have cell phones so you were like on top of each other and didn't have anything do phone yeah right you gotta you got cable TV and your few gluon and then that cable if you're on the road you a lot of times you're standing like back then you're standing these terrible hotels right you didn't have any money so you stayed in some bullshit ass hotel with like three channels you could watch it's like one restaurant some shitty deli and you're you have nothing in common with the person you just had sex with zero that's when you just start drinking that leads to the fight there's a bus stop involved there's a fucking trail Waystation involved it's crazy you know thinking about like finding someone that you are compatible with that you also want to fuck yeah yeah those are two totally different things like you could find someone that you have amazing conversation with but you have zero sexual attraction to them mm-hmm so you have to find a combo you have to find someone that you're sexually attracted to but you really enjoy them as a human being talking to hmm and sometimes those are just not the same things like especially for guys I guess it must be that way for girls obviously I can't speak for them but when you're a guy and you meet a girl like who's got a little ways a big and a big ass willing to put up with a lot of nonsense and you don't even notice you're not even putting up with it yeah you're so fascinated by the looks yeah that the whatever she's saying is just kind of flowing through the bar together she's talking nonsense but then she puts her first clause on your back and just rakes them down a little bit and squeezes you a little yeah yeah the promise of pleasure yeah she put her claws on me bro she did me came to the back scratch like you know what's gonna happen eventually you know yeah and she's like I need my drink I need my drink you have to get me my well it would annoying chick drink like have sex on the beach yeah oh my god I have to have a Long Island iced tea I need my Long Island iced tea I need it that she drinks half of it or a few sips pounds it that's better yeah yeah oh yeah it shrinks a few sips and just leaves it there yeah yeah yeah I have you ever eat she orders a fucking Lobster eats one claw well there's some girls that don't like to eat in front of men yeah they don't like you first of all they don't want to be judged by you eating mm-hmm by them eating in front of you I don't want you judging how much is he eating this is disgusting she's gonna be a big car when she gets older hmm she's just fucking shoveling in her face I can't afford the upkeep but keeping up with this fucking food dispenser she's gonna take a giant shit in my apartment oh my god with a girl like has to shit but tries to hold it you know she doesn't want you to know I had a buddy of mine and he had a like a one-bedroom not even a one-bedroom it's like a studio and the bathroom was right beside the bed which is like right over there and he was dating this girl she just went in there and just wrecked it just wrecked his bathroom and she would do it like every time she came over she would just go in there and wreck his bathroom always complain about you know what to do I would show her right to the door the first time that happened as she came out of the bath I'd take her arm gently and say it's time for you to go okay but what do you do what do you do if you have to shit like what if you go over a girl's house and she's lives in a studio apartment you could take a walk you go to a McDonald's or something yeah I'll be right back yeah have something my car and you go shit in the bushes shit in the bushes San Francisco you go read the sidewalk shit I mean even with my wife like I I close the door I hide the shell she doesn't care door open sits with their legs crossed you hear I'm taking a dump it's just so discouraged oh it's such a bummer that that echo from the fart where the shit comes up it's so weird we know everyone shits it's like yeah why is it - so disturbing to us like we have this idealized image of like some movie woman you know and when it doesn't turn out to be that way turns to be she's an actual human who shits like regular people yeah who's so discouraged so sad so upset it is weird when I see certain beautiful women I remind myself that they shit and then I can't I can't process that I can't I go no she doesn't she can't just Kathleen Turner shits oh yeah giant dump yeah that's probably never really wipes good probably disaster she just gives up way and starts drinking she that's good one white no matter what that's the policy got a flask right there sitting on the bowl doesn't even look one white doesn't inspect just drops it no we got here one of those Japanese toilets it has a button you press a button and shoots water up your ass yeah yeah cleans you up Wow is that the one that's gonna have the flotation tank in it no no swell the one over here oh right there good two of those on it good two of those things here what temperature is the water though it's always warm I need to go there before I leave I don't have to shit just force yourself yeah well that's the thing if you shoot that water up your asshole you will have to shit oh you do it before no you can if you want to yeah I mean if you just want to sit there and press the button it doesn't know whether or not you shit yeah it's not like Greg why do you want me to shoot water on your ass this is illogical you ever had more how you everyday that's so fucking dull I had one yesterday where you get you feel a shit coming and you get excited something to do something to do and then you shit and it feels good I'm not gonna lie to you that might sound gay or whatever but a big hard shit come out of my ass it feels enjoyable like some gooses relief chemicals are released in your body or anybody denies that I want to talk to them yeah I don't have the time enough time to talk to you about that yeah but if a woman tells you that would you get upset if a woman's like oh I love taking a good fat shit this is something about taking a shit feels so good well it would mean that she's up for a splay would it be yeah I mean she's got a sensitive anus are you absolutely he were you ready to take one of the day asshole not a dick but like a pencil dude I had a girl do that she was blowing me way way back when in Boston this chick she was a Guido from Revere and I think I met her with you as a matter of fact we were doing like a Kay do you remember there's a cable-access show in Revere yes and it was like two hot chicks and working where do that with us - I probably he did yeah yeah yeah that sounds like talaiya but we met these two girls and the girl I met she had on she just had on like a college sweatshirt when I met her hair was up in a potato chip clip and you know the leggings and the high top white Reeboks oh that look oh yeah the velcro Reeboks the velcro Reeboks aerobics shoes number so I asked her out and then she goes she goes okay and and we drive she picks me up my car was broken so I go will you pick me up and we're gonna go do a gig in Rhode Island she's like all right Wow so I go down to Kenmore Square she's gonna pick me up at Kenmore Square King white Corvette pulls up this is not what I expected hair is now done it's fucking up it's touching the top of the car nails are done she's got on a hot little dress and I'm like sweetie we're gonna fucking a Roadhouse in Narragansett Rhode Island and I get in her car and we drive down and we get to the club early and we start fooling around and she sucks my dick before the show this like we haven't even had dinner yet sucks my dick takes her finger sticks it up my ass during the blowjob but the fingernail is like a claw and it scraped the inside of my ass and it had blood on the toilet paper when I went to the bathroom later like what would you think it animal she started putting it in I've opened up whoo I didn't but I wasn't thinking about the nail did she lick her finger first is she good just go dry she did that porn drool thing and then ooh and then we went into the club and it was like this it was like a Roadhouse just like in the middle of nowhere there was this just boxy kind of a room was that a Brian deer he did oh yeah yes and we go in and I was doing this joke you probably remember it was one of my standard jokes back then of like the actually I don't remember but it was about a design no radio in car and right people used to have those signs because I didn't want someone breaking my car and something on the radio yeah yeah so I had a joke about how I had that and that somebody then broke into my car and they took the sign or Sunday took the radio and the Sun with it whatever it was and somebody yelled out it was probably uh he said n-word whoa and I went what and I said what like I may I've repeated it to make them say like as if to shame them right and then somebody else on the other side of the crack he said alright let's wrap this one up and and I and I see her laughing Thank You word yeah she thinks it's lame thanks it's great how Larry asked she's sucking that finger that she had an ass right so she drove me back she drove back to Boston and I at that time I was still I was a banquet waiter in the morning so I still have to wake up at like 4:30 in the morning and go down to the Marriott and copy place and set up coffee stations for these fucking conventions I remember this story and so I get in the car to drive home I fucking fall asleep on our inner core Vette as she drives me home and then I get out at my house and I go to kiss her goodnight she just looks at me she goes don't ever fucking call me again whoa and I just lives you fellas laid it in the dirt yeah whoa that's it she's angry that she was angry that I fell asleep that was it just picked me up drove me blew me and then I just passed out I passed that cuz she blew me that's what I do how funny is that don't ever call me again you slept yeah yeah that's what did it she watched her Corvette not hammered not the finger in the ass like that all those are acceptable yeah sucking your dick like moments after meeting you all that's normal you know the horrible food I'm sure they served that gig she probably had some mozzarella sticks that were hard as a rock how funny is that it was no falling asleep pissed her off yeah but people don't like that when they're driving you don't talk to them yeah and just pass out yeah wow that's a great story yeah I remember that I remember that story cuz I remember you you being like stunned at someone yelling out the N word how long is it gonna be before you're not allowed to say the N word like the NY just that that phrase right the phrase describing the word how long before people think that's just as bad as saying the word itself because it's coming it's coming just like hoop earrings and braids and dreadlocks are getting people in trouble yeah people will run out of things to get mad at and they will go after people for saying the n-word right you shouldn't even acknowledge it we need to get it out of our Fernan killer completely yeah by acknowledging it you're not helping what a fucking weird time I only just started saying the n-word I used to say the n-word on my radio show I would just say it and why did you stop saying it don't you think that by not saying it it becomes like this ridiculously charged magic word you're not a racist like wire words magic all right what aren't words supposed to be sounds that you make that convey intent yeah intent or description both well that's the difference you can use the n-word or you can say the n-word you're conveying intent your intent is to describe a scenario where someone said something in a very particular way that showed racism Yeah right that's your intent when you say the n-word you're saying like you know it cannot be speck it cannot be uttered it is a sacred word yeah it is a magic word if you say it Candyman will come now it's like it's very weird it's very weird that we've ever allowed that it's one thing like you could say spic no one's gonna get mad mm-hmm you know like it's not as racially charged you know yeah and then and then there's other ones so like you can just get away with all day like Irish ones oh yeah yank your Guido or they don't give a fuck yeah you can call me a Guido all day I don't give a fuck no one cares they get very upset about rough yeah gook how about Google that's a really rough one yeah but the n-word you won't say it look look at you nigger it's a charge morning hat see but it if you say someone if you you're saying that you're at the club and someone yells out it was probably an Enka yeah which is probably exactly they said that that's not you're not racist you're not being racist but by saying he yells out it was probably an n-word yeah like you're putting all this weight on that word and you're not using it in any way shape or form you personally are not using it to promote racism you're doing the opposite you're talking about what apes you're doing stand-up for mm-hmm this girl was laughing at those Apes mm-hmm and also the crazy thing is that some people can yes some can some can't Latino yeah they can say it I can still say it even like you see middle-eastern kids that grew up in the hood they say it hmm yeah as long as you seem to be in some sort of a marginalized group yeah I've seen a lot of Chinese people use it yeah yes yeah it's interesting and then like yep people are really into hip-hop yeah you know they'll use it and they used with the a on the end of it yeah but black people just throw it around like a beach ball at a concert well my son likes rap and I go and he sings it and I go what do you do when you hit the n-word he goes I just say player that's his friends then they say player we think Tom Hanks son says that's Jenny's house it that's a good question losing power yeah it's getting dark it's back that's so strange what what a stupid thing to have set up four times yes yes who did they set that up on purpose yeah we need to switch that out I gotta say for the first show it's gone very smoothly oh yeah I mean we have a few hiccups that we need to deal with I thought that echo was gonna be an issue but it seems like it's just those microphones that was the echo right it is right because it doesn't sound any different than me I like the purple behind you it's just fetching it's real life your skin tone let me say put me up on the oh yeah it's a nice change you know and the only reason and all honestly we want Purple's because the guy was doing it said I couldn't find red the first time so I'm gonna look at his new places well what he got and he said well there's a lot other cars like oh you got purple and he goes oh we can get purple Mike let's go with purple fuck it purple is the ancient color of royalty is it yeah Jesus there was a lot of it was always a symbol of Jesus purple because it meant it meant you know the Royals I didn't know that yeah hmm it's a beautiful color it's flowers right like tulips and shit there we go royalty in Europe since the time that the Roman emperors wore a tyrion tyrion purple purple papa hmm toga pray Wow prae te x ta how do you say that pray texta pretext Oh mmm purple has been the color most associated with royalty the British royal family into the European royalty still use it as a ceremonial color on special occasions what does that plant said some purple cabbage or some shit we've had to call cauliflower pretty pretty pretty color purple I was associated with Prince that's right there you go that was that one of the biggest bummers from me of like celebrity deaths Prince was one of the all-time biggest that's amazing I was talking to because when Tom Petty died that one really does a hard one too that was a hardened because he was such the fucking soundtrack of our teen years and older years I mean free fallin when I was in my 30s and like his songs continued but somehow Prince who didn't have you couldn't name more than three Prince songs oh yeah I could most people can't yeah I was a dude pray yeah Prince played a big part in my late teens like wow yeah I was I was a huge Purple Rain time controversy even before that yeah I was a fan of Prince from his first cassette when it was just him with no shirt on on the cover looking very androgynous like there's no one like him before I remember seeing that that cover somewhere and going what the fuck is this like what is this guy and then I heard some of the songs I don't even remember what the big hits were for the first one this is pre Purple Rain though but I remember controversy don't know don't you know big controversy remember that song No do I believe in God do I believe in me some people want to die so they can be free controversy but that's the cover oh yeah it's a little tiny patch of hair in the middle of his chest nobody but my point being first not knowing a big catalogue of his music it did mean a lot to me he was what was that release in the 70s really what does it say 79 Wow released in 1979 October 19th Wow real close to today hmm real close to today in 79 almost 40 years ago wow that's crazy that's crazy bit more of an impact on e than Bowie yeah for me yeah i mean i was a big Bowie fan - mm-hmm but the thing about prints that was harder than Bowie for me was that Bowie died of a disease right yeah didn't he yeah he had a was he cancer I think he had some type of cancer Prince died from painkillers yeah that's what drove me nuts it's like that goddamn fentanyl they found fentanyl in his body and I remember thinking at the time what god damn it I can't believe these fucking pills got prints like because there was the Michael Jackson drug - right no no no Michael Jackson Oh died yeah he died from anesthesia he was so fucked up that one before he died he couldn't sleep so he would get anesthetized mmm just stop and think about how many beam is you have to have where ambien doesn't work anymore yeah the amazing thing is he would get up out of that and they said he was first guy on the set choreograph in his own shit rehearsing harder than anybody well I wonder when he started doing that cuz you know they his last tour he was like that he was preparing for his final tour and he was working his fucking balls off Wow yeah you can't do that very long apparently apparently that's part of the problem was that stuff it limits your REM sleep yeah which is by the way one of the biggest things that's been happened to me since not smoking pot for all these days all these many many moons 16 days don't we said 17 days the dreams are way different like way different like intense dreams like I have weird dreams man like they're very vivid and I never thought about that before are they the same same dreams over and over again no not at all but they're very vivid like way more vivid than when I was smoking pot oh wow like way more cuz you think you're in a deeper REM cycle I've heard things but I don't know what it is Jamie pull pull up that see if you could find out what it is what's the cause before I thought I had to do it the alpha waves state that marijuana does that make sense a little bit you can't your body is not at rest or your brain isn't at rest let's do an alpha you need beta waves I think for us I don't know what what it is but whatever the fuck it is when you don't smoke pot when you smoke pot all the time for years and then you don't smoke pot you have some fucking dreams baby whoa like they're intense like sometimes I wake up to pee and I go what the fuck is going on in my head well like weird crazy dreams like being in a plane where it comes really close to hitting a mountain the next thing you know you're hanging on the ledge of a building and the next thing you know you're running through the woods and next thing you know you know it's fucking freezing cold and you're trying to stay warm and you got a fire going yeah kind of fucking wacky primal dreams am I going through here that's awesome very weird because I'm waking up and just like it's not gonna wake up and I'm scared I wake up going well what the fuck am i doing hmm Studies on cannabis and sleep were conducted in 1970s some information about the possible effects of cannabis and sleep low dose of THC four to twenty milligrams mildly decreased REM sleep in both regular users and non-users interestingly deep sleep was increased when cannabis was initially used but this effect disappeared after repeated use with high doses of THC 50 to 200 10 milligrams now stop and think about Lisa at Eaton 500 yeah and that's a double which is way different REM sleep was decreased in both regular users and non-users total sleep time was not affected but deep sleep was decreased when THC was stopped some rebound in REM sleep was found with reduced sleep time and increased time to fall asleep now this is interesting because what I want to know that some people do have withdrawal symptoms when stopping prolonged and heavy use of cannabis and this can adversely affect sleep I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms zero none not one but what's interesting to me is I wonder if there's any benefit to not have to having those dreams rather versus not having those dreams like I wonder if in some way I'm doing myself a disservice by smoking pot all the time I wonder if there's like you know is there like a point of diminishing returns about because like there's a lot of benefits for cannabis right there's a lot of benefits in terms of the anti-inflammatory effects there's neuroprotective effects of cannabis that they found that regular users like they think it might actually like hold off Alzheimer's and some people but I wonder you know what's the what's the balance because I'm really I've never really considered that it was an issue at all I always felt like there was zero health like negative health effects of using it for me personally I'm like I get my blood work done regularly I'm healthy I eat really well I take a lot of vitamins I exercise regularly like pot so I smoked pot and obviously it's not hurting me it's not like people who drink all the time and fuck up their liver in their body and but now I'm wondering doesn't affect your memory of a great memory it's pretty good maybe you'd be better mm-hmm maybe you know essentially would hear up to me the longer article about alcohol and marijuana effects on sleep but this is a marijuana part okay was it saying furthermore it can increase slow-wave n REM deep sleep which is good because that's where experts believe most of your actual recuperation takes place however as you continue to consume your slow-wave sleep will get severely reduced reducing the restfulness of your sleep is supposed to provide reducing rather the restfulness your sleep is supposed to provide hmm so but here's the thing like if what if I get high during the day like why is it affecting my sleep at night that's what's confusing because it's not like I get high a lot at night sometimes me and the Misses will smoke a little before it yeah sure it feels better that way puncher you smoke my own fuck oh wow that's a heart that's why I'm scared that Krissy blink he's too old she can't take it anymore I told you to duck Christie I wanted to bleed like your butthole did that day a couple days you know you have sex with someone they start breaking that's not good but I'm wondering I'm wondering like I need to know I want to find out like what's the I think I'm gonna start looking into this now now is that different than that's stuff that CBDs yeah very different yeah very different psychoactive I disagree no you know what you're talking about you're talking about that Charlotte's Web yes see that she gets me high yeah see it doesn't get me high but I'm not I'm not sure if we have the same obviously we have the same don't have the same body you know like what affects you problem that you know food wise and yeah everybody's different when it comes to that stuff but Charlotte's Web has a bunch of other cannabinoids it's not just see and that's one of the more beneficial aspects of it mm-hmm is that stuff it uses the full plant so maybe CBD wouldn't get you high but maybe that kind of hemp oil we're more comprehensive right Hannibal oil would get you high that's interesting they get you high like how high nice high just like mellow more like takes the anxiety out and makes me just really it's really nice at the end of the day around five o'clock when you're re-entering the family maybe you have maybe some of that anxiety is coming from inflammation maybe what it's doing is reducing inflammation yeah yeah that's what I would guess yeah because it doesn't make people test positive for THC so like if you had a company and you're working for them I don't want to get anybody fired but I'm pretty sure they've tested this stuff and if you had a company and you're working for them and you know they piss test you and if you're taking like Charlotte's Web oil I don't think it does anything I don't think it shows up right how fucked up is that man I'm gonna job it tests your piss hey Greg what are you having fun over the weekend yeah you fucking loser yeah those the same jobs to tell you can't date anybody from work it's like all right so you got me working 12 hours a day I don't see anybody else in my life and I can't date the women that I'm you know yeah no complications man I know but they shouldn't make it illegal be true they can suggest it but yeah weird how people what to do they do they fucking tell a manager he can't that's sleep with an employee well that's cuz they're worried about some Harvey Weinstein yeah all right that makes sense because that's always the thing the boss fucking the secretary right you know I know a guy a real recently a guy who works with big ass corporation that got busted yes ended at home to the secretary baby oh shit at office day-in day-out looking at each other giving each other nod and then one day in the workplace so they went to a hotel I don't know I don't know specifics but he's in trouble you know him personally I know yeah I can't talk yeah I'll tell you later when you tell me the story about the guy who gave babies to Michael J oh I know you're talking about oh that's right even worse your story involves kids dying that got sent to Michael Jackson isn't it isn't that what it is it's entirely possible yes now I know what you're referring to yeah oh I got other things to tell you about that guy that guy we can't tell you folks cuz well you don't want to get sued yeah you just can't talk about certain things but who knows what was actually going on you know I've always had the weirdest theory about Michael Jackson what that he was castrated he's a castrato uh I would buy that the voice the voice the body extremely thin I didn't look like he had any muscle at all which is like what someone who's been castrated but no testosterone at all couldn't sleep super high-pitched voice kept down high-pitched voice deep into his 50s mm-hmm yeah I mean I don't think the sleep thing I think it's just riddled with anxiety and craziness and all the fucking plastic surgery I mean he was a literally an exercise in madness yeah that was a person who went mad from people paying attention to him yeah with unlimited resources yeah that him looking jacked mmm that doesn't look as jacked as a girl goes across but you know what's amazing though about him is for a scrawny effeminate guy he acted like a badass in his video you know he actually played the part of a guy who was like you know gonna kick somebody's ass criminal you have a sports jacket on in the Thriller video like a Letterman's jacket right yeah yeah I watched her over the other day my kids loved it man yeah they loved the scene way turns into a werewolf yeah my youngest daughter goes he's like a little cat person it's not even a wolf to make toon or some shit I just thriller yeah in some way or another huh the werewolf was so corny looking now it's like it was so weird like it was not really a werewolf it was like a werewolf cat sort of thing remember remember what it look like the the whiskers grew out of his face I remember being of like super excited about it because it was Rick Baker that did it he's the same guy who did the American Werewolf in London he's a makeup guy special effects guy yeah created those masks and all the crazy shit the all special effects that you saw in like a lot of like the really badass horror movies back then like there that's it huh like what is that that's not a wolf what are those whiskers like that's some like a monkey mouth yeah right it's like almost like a baboon mouth right what is that hey he's like a baboon man that's snake eyes yeah it's like a lot of thing yeah but that one looks like a werewolf go go fullscreen on that one you got yeah see oh that's badass it was pretty cool it was interesting yeah but it was uh not a werewolf like you would think of a werewolf like an american werewolf in london werewolf also had on the high school jacket right did he you pull up the American Werewolf in London oh oh maybe not American wealth in London maybe he did when they were walking through the bogs because he was supposed to be a college guy right so maybe he had a college Letterman's jacket on oh no it's just uh yeah it was just like huh yeah it was just a Down coat fuck that's a good movie that was I got to show my kids that movie don't show I want they're old enough it's an intense movie look at that Jesus Christ go full screen on that I don't remember that scene Oh Oh obviously whoa how old should my daughter be before she watches Bruno what's Bruno oh that's like the gay yeah now fuck it's okay all right yeah she likes the Beach Boys yeah show us from geisha [Laughter] she'll ask if she can watch a movie at dinner and I'm always like hi I don't know what's appropriate anymore for anybody my wife got mad guys showed the nine-year-old the original alien movie oh it is scare no she's a little badass she hung in there she loved yeah she's like this is like times kids like that there's intention span it's too short for a slow movie like that you really think I'm movie slow oh yeah I heard Blade Runner the new Blade Runner is very slow very awesome really yeah I heard it's like super underrated huh all these people are like it's not doing well yeah I haven't seen it but I need to see it but a lot of people are saying that it's like really slow yeah no movies are doing well this year what do you think that is maybe people are watching Netflix more I think that's exactly what it is because the movie experience is an hour and a half two hours right plus get an air parking a lot of money yeah Netflix is like what nine bucks a month mm-hmm and you get just binge watch house of cards your fucking head falls off yeah I'm watching the Oh a right now you know what that is it's a weird supernatural thriller on Netflix it's really great it's great although some assholes on Twitter thought it was a good idea to give me some spoilers that's fucked up you twats I shouldn't have said I was just trying to tell people that I found a good show and then I fucked up because again late at night barely paying attention read some of the comments my god damn it got a wolf shirt on what does it say we don't need a season two of the oh eh oh fuck off people just think it's such a great idea to be negative and it's so much fun to be negative although I badmouth Aerosmith on this episode you did a little bit I'm a hypocrite I don't feel good about that well you did what you got to do oh my um you know what the best show I've seen in a long time as the Americans it's on it's on Amazon Prime it's about this couple that comes from Russia and they've been they've been taught to be Americans from the time they were like you know yeah twelve years old you know that's based on a true story yeah yeah Montclair New Jersey dude that fucking the acting is Keri Russell I forget the guys name but they're just so fucking good she's a badass Keri Russell what else has she been in she was in that Felicity which was huge yeah but it's like I watched six seasons of it in six months and they fucked a bunch of other people right
