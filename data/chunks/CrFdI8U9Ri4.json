hello freak bitches what so how long you been raising bees probably only maybe four years how'd you get started in that how you start raising bees start with one I'll actually start with two really no um they're not like rabbits but they do produce quite quickly you know my dad raised bees I just we always saw boxes out in the corner of the house you know we grew up in LA here and you know the weather so great so there's you know lots of P acting that's the bummer about being in Vail now not a lot of not a lot of B action going on it's too high it's too cold right and you know certain vegetables grow there but not a lot but in California the ranch love I love it I got had a friend who in his backyard he he probably had six hives and he had this one really intense kind of rogue hive where maybe the Queen had some kind of strain of Africanized or something and her wife could not his wife could not go out in the backyard without being attacked you know whoa so he says hey can I go put my bees on your property so they can cycle this Queen out you know they got some breeding and it was just off Jesus Christ so he brought it out to the ranch he pinched the bee and then pinched the Queen pinched it what do you mean killed it and then Jesus Christ that's a nice euphemism you didn't have to shoot it or nothing you know I mean hold still so you just grab the Queen and killed her well as pinched it because she was reproducing I mean they lay like a million eggs in their lives it's insane that I mean I basically I could sit here and talk a whole hour about bees because they're so interesting let's do it all right well I'm a listener I'm not scared now there was some they'll listen trust me it's interesting stuff so yeah but it put a new queen in there and they they you know cycled through all the deal other bees I mean they only live a month so what is it an or so a normal reaction when people go in the yard would be they would be just disinterest they wouldn't care about you as long as you're not in reppin the hive exactly but your wife would go out there and they would just get crazy yeah those of you oh yeah did you know this wasn't me this was my friends wow that's right I'm soda but yeah I mean be he he's kind of used to it and she was not she was out to go slightly go out there and they would they would get crazy with him but he's like this doesn't bother me but she was like fuck this Queen fucked his hive yeah yeah pretty much and there's certain things if we were in black they all attack you you know almost they think you're a bear you know what yeah if you've like just eaten bananas there's some there's some I don't know a smell or something in it that is similar to their attack pheromone that they set off so there's a few things I've learned over the years don't eat bananas and don't eat don't wear black exactly that's all you gotta do but I learned this stuff being in the B Club you're in a puzzle I was in the B Club yeah in the Bay Area yeah we'd meet down at the American legions Paul and have a monthly meeting you know what are those dorks like I mean my buddy gonna be oh my god we would just sit there and kind of laugh about him but we're sitting there I mean we're here to learn some stuff but there were people up there though okay we inseminate it the Queen with this and you know they were counting bees you know we put little numbers on every bee and we caught their flight pattern and how many were reproducing this and I mean it it's all you know it's all like they're there they're doing research on how to make the be stronger because the bees are you know going away right but you know it's this might this little varroa mite that's killing a lot of them too along with the pesticides and herbicides but you know people that are so into it and we're just kind of sitting there going on man what if we got ourselves into but it's kind of you know it's funny in a certain way but I'm glad that it's happening but you know I get you know at the end at the end of the season you got like 500 pounds of honey when you're handing them out to your friends and everyone's loving it fine hundred pounds of honey that's insane yeah and we're bottling it up my kids are filtering it were you know bottling it up and it's dude it's just straight from the hive into a bottle I mean after you've filtered it and it really helps with allergies it helps with you know the whatever getting the pollens and then and the connectors from the area so when you take that in and it helps build your immune system yeah I've heard that so you've experienced that personally absolutely and I think being stung by bees helps you to it helps with with something getting your your immune system built up to it supposed to be really good for arthritis they they take people like literally take bees people that are that have like serious arthritis in their hands and they sting their hands with it on purpose right I think there's some people that do it for their lips here in LA ah I think you need people that are so deep deep deep in the bee world because you're not going to do it I'm not gonna do it but if someone's just so far gone they're measuring all their bees and monitoring their flight patterns and checking their DNA I'm just fascinated that there was a clear differentiation between a normal B and the way these bees were behaving you could tell that the Queen was kind of a freak but I tell you those freak bees the Africanized or whatever now there's a zombie bee and we can get into that too but they are they're aggressive and an aggressive you know it's like any society they do well they they get most they produce a lot of honey and they they're very very prolific in what they do you know yeah I've had killer bee honey they make killer bee like what sounded on it I don't know if it knows any better it's killer bee honey is better than regular honey but just pretty doped I've killer bee honey around your house well yeah you know that and the gosh what's this stuff called I mean there's there's lots of really cool healing properties and like even the the kind of glue that they use to plug up holes and you know the royal jelly which is you know comes from there like the brain in it that's how they produce a queen I mean there's a royal jelly is yeah yeah it's from their brains brain juice man holy shit how does it come out is it come out of a hole somewhere uh where they scooping out their fucking heads I haven't seen it that close but yeah they they inject it into the they injected into the queen cell or there's a cell that they make when a new queen is being made so all the bees that are flying around that you see out here you know they're all females it's a huge it's all female Society so the drones that are in there which are the males they're there just to reproduce and then they get kicked out in the wintertime they'll die yeah whoa yeah man it's hard out spoodle brutal for us men in the bee world so if they all die how do they continue to reproduce well there's some I guess the couple stay late they they the Queen makes more Wow so those guys are just dead the Queen makes more and the new ones take over the new boys yeah yeah and they're just doing work they're just they're just fertilizing that's that are doing they're just there to fuck and then everybody else is doing all the real work fuck and go die that's what you get to do through the world that's the what a fucking crazy world yeah and then the Queen goes around the hive and finds the females other other potential queens and stabs them while they're in the hive pretty much yeah well they're they're all females they're all females cept for those drones and then you know if there's if they're making you know she knows she's gonna die or they're they're kind of pissed off with her she's not reproducing as much as she should she will take off with like half the hive and that's where you see a swarm so she'll go and form a new hive and then these ones have a little queen cell that they've laid eggs and start to make a new queen so that's how they reproduce and if there's three or four queen cells in there the first queen that's born she comes out and she kills all the other Queens so she can rule Game of Thrones type shit good that's fascinating and you're gonna get bees I can tell from right now I'm looking in my head I'm just looking at websites in my hand I'm like to find out where to get the bees yeah that sounds like an amazing way to get honey I mean it just sounds like a really cool thing to do - I taste so good and we've got you know we have a place in Hawaii so we've got Hawaiian flavors Hawaiian flavored well there's stuff you know that they get the nectar and fallen from over there and the in Hawaii's nonstop yeah so you're getting honey year-round what Island and Maui oh man I love Maui that's a beautiful spot um so when you're how do you know that Abby is Africanized because that was the big thing that everybody was worried about remember was like the early 90s everybody was like two weeks they found an African Killer Bee and no Mexico or something it was like it's coming up it's gonna it's gonna swarm they gonna take over the country and inside of a few years right it was a big hysteria about that right yeah well and there are there are states where there are more prevalent than others and they're just more aggressive they're more aggressive in there they're there they're very protective so you'll get stung if you're messin with them so that's all it is there's nothing so right but we there was a big concern that they were going to take home and that it was going to be that these bees were just going to come here and out breed the regular bees and you're laughing impossible oh yeah for sure there's some great movies about that - yeah the killer bees but there's no way to tell by looking at them I don't know I don't think so um I'm somewhat into it but I haven't haven't investigated that part yet so these bees that came over from the perhaps Africanized bees that when they killed the Queen and then introduced those bees to the rest of the bees did everybody chill out yeah so it's just that one crazy bitch well yeah she you know she's laying the eggs she's passing on the whatever DNA but those the the the forager bees the ones that you see out and about they only live a month so they will die out and how long she live she could live between one to five years huh mmm what a bizarre culture string really cool and without them I mean you're there's lots of you know orange almonds all kinds of stuff especially here in California in the you know in the in the center center of California all that farming if there's no bees there's there's no fruit yeah what a bizarre sort of symbiotic relationship that we have with some one weird insect pollination I mean you would have thought that that would have been taking care of some other way right and it wouldn't be that a bee has to do it well there are others that do it what am i doing butterflies and really certain I'll tell you not just honeybees but there's there's probably over 3,000 different kinds of bees there they don't have us they don't have a hive Society like the honeybees do but all these other bees are like loners they're they live in the ground or something and they just they just get enough pollen for themselves so they're kind of lone lone wolves out there but the honeybees are the ones that have more of a society I raise chickens and this the chicken thing with us happened we just got a couple chickens and the next thing you know we got this giant fucking chicken house at 23 chickens and they're running around my yard is that the same way with you just kind of like slowly step into this then get deeper and deeper yeah it me just like getting your first tattoos like yeah wow that's cool I want more right and yet you just start to appreciate it I think when I come off tour it's like my head is like ricocheting around and there I go and I'll sit and watch the bees just watch them go in and out in and out there's like this friggin landing strip that they come in and they look so busy it relaxes me I know that's like wow okay I'm not that busy just yeah yeah just chill no is there a way do you have like a glass wall in any way where you can see into the hive you ever seen those hives where they make them do you have it like that we can look in there yeah I've got one of the yeah Wow oh that's like a display one we bring into schools and stuff yeah see I don't have one of those but I got a couple different kinds of hives and it's fun to see you know sometimes you have the the frames that are already kind of pre-built and then they just deposit their stuff in that or you watch them grow their own comb from nothing and it's pretty amazing yeah how do you get them to stay there though like how does it work like I see those boxes and I know that bees do have hives in those boxes but how does it initially start well it's the Queen wherever the Queen is that's where they go so if she decides to be in that bus how do you get her to stay in that box uh you have a place for her to lay eggs I mean that's that's it yeah and she will stay and if she's there you know when they go off to to they swarm to go find a new hive if you've ever seen a swarm up in a tree just like a giant like football size or even bigger a shape of just bees that Queen's right in the middle and they're all just around her and then they send off the the scouts to find a new spot they come back say hey it's over here you do their little wiggle dance and that shows them how to get there and they all go there we had an incident once on fear factor where we covered these people with bees there was like a beekeeper there and he had his hive and a local hive came over and a group of bees came over and met with these bees and we had to clear the area out and they had to have a conversation hey that's literally what happened they were in the air just floating around and then they worked it out and then the our bees came back and they went back to the hive and their bees went about their business they were just like what the fuck's going on you guys moving in here like what are you doing territorial somehow or another they worked it out though there was no bee death there was that be fuckin Braveheart war it just they figured it out that a good negotiator I don't wonder what do they communicate with any living these in pheromones like how are they smells smells and dances till they do it yeah ances yeah some bee you'll find it like a good hey man I found like a garden somewhere and they'll come back and they'll see him do the little wiggle thing it's like how many wiggles this way and then they turn left and then turn that K that's that's like a half a mile this way and then it that way and then they all learn it then they go for hey I found some water here's a place to go so they literally can tell them where something is by the movements yeah holy shit that's crazy so it's almost like a like a body language pretty much yeah and they all know it somehow yeah instinctively yep Wow yeah it's pretty bizarre there's a lot a lot to learn about those things that's really bizarre yeah I didn't know that they could tell each other where something is just by wiggling like they have like this means a mile that means go left Wow man I'm gonna get deep in bees man what the fuck have you done all right yeah and there's I'm sure there's probably a feel of like wow I'm there's a whole society right here in my yard and I'm I'm overseeing it you know this yeah probably a sense of importance but you know I lay off them I mean there are people that are you know checking them all the time and this and that and oh you got to put the the certain pads in there to kill the mites and you got to do this and that's like another natural man they've been around longer than we have so just let them go they know what they're doing I don't you know who who's to say I know what I'm doing with them do they need specific types of plants around them in order to survive yeah well something they can pollinate and you know it's from uh it's good to plant you know what I plant I planted stuff that you know okay it blooms in the spring and then there's other stuff that blooms in the summer and then there's other stuff that blooms you know like a late summer so they've always got something going on but they hibernate they hibernate in the winter no kidding the SEC Bears yep so when you are in Vail and you you have obviously really cold weather in the winter what do they do they just shut down stay in the hive and don't move well I don't have bees in Vail yet and I'm gonna try to figure out how to do that but they I mean just like cattle you know you went to room down in the lowlands so I haven't found a place to to have bees go where they're you know it does less snow but I'll figure something out because it's something I love doing [Music]
