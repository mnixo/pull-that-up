the girag and experience I mean that the war on drugs has destroyed our inner cities it's corrupted two police forces it's screwed up by you know the police south of the border and and now you have a situation too or your inner city kid and you know you've got minimum wage laws and you've got occupational licensing laws that make it almost impossible for a young kid to get a legitimate job yet you've got the gangbangers flashing around you know a wad of cash hey just deal drugs you can make a lot of money when you think that minimum wage and the difficulty in getting licensed for certain positions are what's keeping people down of course minimum wage is keeping people down absolutely how is that what how's that true well just remember you know you know when you're young when your teenager right you don't have a lot of skills I mean you really might have never have even had a job and what's more important in getting a job is not necessarily the paycheck that's kind of secondary it's what you learn on the job and you know what I had my first jobs and I was working me you know you're living in talking about outside of high school or in high school to all that's important is money the money is the only thing that's not to know I mean we really when you are look you want the money right this you want money for to take a girl out on the date or maybe you need it as money right but you don't need rent money you're living at home you don't need food your your overhead is taken care of that the real benefit is acquiring skills on-the-job training that will enable you to earn more money as you get older can take on more responsibilities I can these skills when you work with shirt and hamburger joint what am I what skills am I getting working at Newport Creamery they're a lot like I'll give you an example of gas stations because gas station is a good example I worked at a gas station because at one point in time there are a lot of jobs for young kids at gas stations you know begin and and they work mainly for tips you know yay would pump gas they would check the air and the tires they'd wash your windows and they didn't make very much but between fill-ups and these are the pump jockeys right between Phillips maybe they worked with a mechanic and they helped out the mechanics and you know a lot of auto mechanics got their start as you know you know pump jockeys and you know eventually you know they were able to become a mechanic and they can earn more money and some of them maybe eventually opened up their own gas station and you know became entrepreneurs and had a few but they got started you know at an entry-level position now of course the minimum wage law it's all self-serve I mean you go to a gas state there's no human beings there maybe there's one guy that's in a little booth that's kind of overseeing but you know if you want to check your air and your tire you do yourself you want to wash your windows you wash your own windows all those jobs have been eliminated by the minimum wage but so of the opportunities that came with them and now if you want to get a mechanic well you got to go to vocational school you got to pay money you got to go into debt you know maybe you can learn to be a mechanic but you know on-the-job training was how young people used to acquire skills you know now we've got all those guys going to college they get a philosophy degree you know they spend six years you know you know barfing at frat parties but they graduate with a huge debt they know nothing you know a lot of them would have been better off getting it you know getting a low paying job and learning how to do something during this time of this when people did learn how to be a mechanic by becoming a pump jockey there was a minimum wage in effect now well the minimum wage in America didn't start until 1938 yeah but I I looked at a gas station now but let me Linda I had a minimum wage it started in 1938 and it only affected some certain federal workers it wasn't and it was twenty was was it five twenty five cents an hour it didn't apply to most workers until the mid 1960s so it was the war on poverty that really brought about the minimum wage so and and of course over time as the minimum wage got higher and higher during the 60s and 70s that's when it really began to take a bigger toll but like if you look now at like black teenage unemployment which is off the charts which is what 50 60 70 percent of my for example it is but if you go back before the minimum wage right black teenage unemployment was made out of fifteen percent it was actually lower than white teenage unemployment um and and all this stuff you take you take the bottom rung off the job ladder and you just obliterate it you just make it impossible for young unskilled people to get a job and it's not just the minimum wage because that's the beginning right because if you employ somebody the minimum wage you still got to pay payroll taxes you got to pay unemployment taxes you've got other mandated costs legal costs that increase the cost of hiring so maybe even though the minimum wage is 725 an hour maybe it cost you 10 bucks to hire the guy an hour even though you only give them 725 it cost you 10 bucks what if what what if their productivity is only worth dollarz you can't hire them it's impossible you're not going to hire them to lose money you're not going to train somebody I mean you know there are a lot of people these success stories you know people go from the mailroom to the boardroom you know it's harder to start you know at the bottom because it's hard to get your foot on the bottom right because you know you have to be at a much higher level and it disproportionately impacts poor kids inner-city kids uh you know and and it favors these minimum wage laws will favor skilled workers over unskilled workers because if I have to pay a certain wage well then maybe I'll hire somebody who has more skill in fact it was the skilled workers the labor unions that lobby for the minimum wage not because it benefited them because they did they made much more than min wage what they wanted to do is make it expensive to hire unskilled labor so you wouldn't hire the unskilled labor you would just hire the union labor I see what you're saying so what you're saying essentially is that minimum wage is more government intrusion and the more freedom that you have the government take away from you whether it's minimum wage freedom whether it's tax free whatever it is the worst is going to be you know more regulations you're gonna have more people involved more red tape more bullshit more waste more correction I should have a right to work you know if a dollar an hour you know if I want to write it you know if and look you know the interesting thing look at all these lawsuits now the internships in the in the entertainment industry you know this is the perverse effect of it so the government made it illegal to pay somebody below the minimum wage but it was okay if they worked for free right so now you have all these interns who probably would have been paid something if it wasn't for the minimum wage but since it was illegal to pay them something they ended up working for nothing of course now they're suing and they're winning lawsuits say hey yet you have to pay me so now they're going to destroy the internships and now a lot of these companies that used to have internships aren't going to have them anymore don't the interns get college credit it wasn't that the whole idea behind it is that they let them do but then but then that was even worse because what would happen sometimes in order to keep themselves safe because the employers didn't want to you know run afoul of the employment law so they would only give you the internship if you got it through a college right so now what would happen is you'd actually have to pay to be an intern because you'd go and pay tuition to a college just so you can go and work for free I mean wouldn't it be better not to pay the tuition and go into debt and just work for a low wage than to pay to work for no wage I mean this is what happens you know when you have all these government regulations every buddy is worse off and you know people people think all these you know the young you know people are being exploited no they're not it's not exploitation a lot of times it's the best thing that can happen to them is they get a job and you know people say well you know you can't raise a family on the minimum wage of course not and you shouldn't even try I mean if all you can do is flip burgers why are you starting a family I mean you should see no you got it develop your skills you got to be able to earn more money than that before you take on those extra responsibilities but if you say hey every wage has to be a wage that could let you you know support a family then there are no entry-level jobs well then how do you enter the labor market if there's no entry-level position you know well if you're in a situation like a fast-food gig I mean where does that lead to the manager I mean what how do you gonna rise through the ranks at a fast-food with some people right some people start out you know you know cooking french fries or mopping up and go on to be a own a franchisee I mean so you can certainly move up and there are people I think the guy who's about to be this the new CEO of Walmart his first job was working on a loading dock in one of the distribution centers and now his good uses CEO he worked his way up to the very top of the call he went to college but I mean that's not but that's not how he got his foot the door and I you probably you know but but the I mean they wouldn't have hired him to run the company let maybe college right but I don't know but maybe maybe maybe the fact that he worked there gave maybe that game a legacy I'm sure that definitely had an impact but if you take a look at someone that works at McDonald's you don't necessarily have to work up the chain of McDonald's your McDonald's could be your first job look what were my first jobs I deliver groceries I bag groceries I sigh I sold you know clothing retail in the mall I sold shoes I sold cable door-to-door they said well you know did I move up and they can no but I I ended up getting other jobs where you know the sales skills were important you know you get you just even when I was got my first job at a supermarket a lot of times I was just mopping up the floors I was bagging the groceries and I would deliver the groceries but you just learn to show up at time you know and now you have something that you've done I mean a lot of it so you get a job at McDonald's and then you get a job someplace else that's better because what did you do before you were here well I worked at McDonald's how long were you there I was there for a couple years in fact still have the job oh well that means at least you didn't get fired you have the job I mean you've got something you've got to start somewhere everybody starts somewhere and you can't expect to get paid a lot of money when you first start out you've got to make yourself more valuable because what you are when we get individuals we sell our labor to the highest bidder you know and so what you have to do is you got to figure out how can I increase my value to a potential employer so that he'll pay me more money but isn't the idea of minimum wage is to keep it from being gross no just like make it so it is low fifteen dollars an hour is pretty low it's incredibly difficult to make a living you know it's getting $15 an hour but I must say you don't have to make a living you just feed yourself if they if they enforced a minimum wage of $15 an hour okay like McDonald's there would be no human beings working there it would all be automated they wouldn't you know you know there might be one guy there that made sure that the robots didn't you know didn't break down but you know there'd be machines making the hamburgers make it a french fries would be like a gas station wouldn't that be good just like we were talking about deregulation the government forcing them to get real jobs wanted for the people that work in the fast-food to I'm not the tip Burger King and force them out there no but then they would what would they do that just go on welfare for them no way figure out a way gether and get a real job but no but that is their entry to the job market and I mean they have no skills look believe me if these people had better skills would they be working at McDonald's now part of the problem is and this isn't you know that there are some people that really could be working better jobs but they're not because we have this phony economy that is preventing those better jobs from being created that's that's the problem there are a lot of people now that are working at McDonald's because that's all they can get and you know it's not you know it's at least they got that to fall back on but the problem is why aren't there better jobs why aren't the jobs that would normally be there for you to work up right the jobs that are higher up on the ladder where are those jobs ok those jobs are being destroyed by the government because we need more savings we need more capital investment we need higher interest rates for that to happen and the government is so busy inflating this bubble economy that they're sucking all the air out of the real economy they're diverting resources from Main Street to Wall Street and they are preventing these jobs from being created in fact they're destroying a lot of the jobs that exist so how would you fix that if you if I'm bombing and I say Peter Schiff I heard you on the Joe Rogan experience you make a lot of sense listen guys I got working for me fucking suck come over here man sit down tell me what the fuck to do what can I do here how do we fix this mess other than resigning by guess if you oh how dare you if he's actually good not a way to make friends but if he's actually gonna listen to me that I don't want to resign let's attend the exactly has that kind of Epiphany let's pretend Jamie's the president you got to convince him yeah well then you go gee he's got a what would you tell them to do what would you tell him to do he's got to start you know repealing rules and regulations and and and shrinking government and you know letting closing down agencies and departments and laying off government workers you know and then which government workers would howdy where do you start almost are at the top I mean we got you know presidents fire the presidents if you want to save the company you got to go under yourself I said get rid of all the economic advisors look right okay the Department of Energy Department of Agriculture Department of Education assholes every one of them some of them are some of mark but we can't afford them and they're not helping they're not making the country richer they're making it poor you [Music]
