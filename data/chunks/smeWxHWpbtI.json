hello freak bitches people haven't seen the documentary what was going on what happened there was a burglary call at the house so we've responded as patrol right and we checked out the place and inside it was two young girls who were sitting there on the floor in this home you know with the door not broken off and they said that they were given permission by the owner of the home to spend the afternoon or day here in her home and well where I asked her well where did where did the owner happen to be since you know you broke the doorknob to get in oh she's in prison right now I said oh and for what and she goes well I think for drugs I said okay thank you so I turned left hard and there's a box of fucking shoes piles of box of shoes mm-hmm if anyone knows anything about the drug business they spend a lot of money on their personal shoes because what else you gonna spend money on you know Brian you can't build a new house in the ghetto yeah just wasting your money but you could have a lot of shoes so I saw all these boxes of shoes nice high heels pumps all this stuff so I said okay there's a girl in here spend a lot of money on shoes and the furniture looked pretty good for the location so I open the closet and has a fucking duffel bag filled with cash I pick up actually that's really not exactly what happened so me anti-crime guy went in there picked up the big he looks at me what are you this come on we spend all day bowing them I leave it there he puts it down I put my hand up on the money in my pockets but I had no rumors we're in summer clothes I didn't have I went to uniform on with the jacket we can stuff everything's so anyway I said this is not gonna work as too much money here you can't you can't run out of a building with a big filled with money and have the cops see you because they're gonna say where'd the bear go right right so my enemy was the cops at this point so you know I found a way to circle the house for an hour and a half and every possible direction you could and it and then chicky finally pulls up with another guy that was retired from the job they walked in with their Duke badges on and the Landlord lets them in and yeah that's they just they just left that built that apartment up right up there and he went in he'd come out with the big I got a minute later I pulled him over pull them over real good I go what are you gonna do that's it II I ho great I go back to the self cell phone I go back to the pay phone on the corner back then we had the original call form you would drive the patrol car up on a curb and just reach out to the fucking AT&T phone booth so you'd sit in the patrol car and dial the precinct so I dialed the precinct it was a free cool by the way and and it was yeah my wife needs to be at home right now you know one of the kids broke a toe whatever you never excuse you to come up with okay no problem come in you take most times called lost time so I told the girl in the car is working with was an ID plant by the way she she was Internal Affairs plant sitting with me the whole time I said okay I said you know home my wife just paid you that beep is back there my wife just paged me two kids sick or something and so I went back to the precinct signed out went to Atlantic City in a limousine and so cleaned the money did the girl who was driving around with you as you were going around for an hour and a half was a plant yes she was Internal Affairs cop okay let's see here national violence against women survey found that 21.5 percent of men and thirty five point four percent of women living with same-sex partners experienced intimate partner for that includes gay now that's yeah that's exactly what we're saying so that shows that lesbians are more likely to play out their partners than gay men are comparable with 7.1 and twenty point four percent for men and women respectively with a history of only opposite sex cohabitation that's crazy so what that says is that seven point one percent of women have experienced domestic violence by men but twenty point four percent of men have experienced domestic violence by women the good thing what that says to me is that I am NOT alone okay but that's Massachusetts see that right there Massachusetts is filled with monsters drummers women be yo fuckin queer they beat your ass they're terrible people only the only chick that I ever had to take a swing at me was a girl that I dated from Boston really she took us swimming while I was fighting I was I was in the middle of competition back then like I was I was at a cuando I was now his kickboxing I was fuckin crazy like in this chick took a swing me and I watched it coming and I was like I don't even believe this is happening and I ducked under it and I grabbed ahold of her I'm like what are you doing are you hitting me you're gonna hit me there's the only time a girl are you fucking queer they're monsters they drunk they eaten potatoes just fucking swinging out here that's why it's Massachusetts I'll bet you look at the rest of the country it's probably totally different numbers no I don't if you like to do hunson aren't fair chase if you like doing it why do you why do they have such a hard time just saying that's what I'd like to do well I spent an enormous amount of time explaining why I like to do what I do you know why don't I would love for one of them to explain to me what they like about it instead of doing it and acting like they did something different well the part of it is the network themselves right the Outdoor Channel and the Sportsman's Channel they don't allow you to show high fences that's a part of their bylines right I don't know if they say don't show hyphens they might not want this is coming from Ben O'Brien yeah so they might I don't they might not I can't say they say don't show it or if they're saying don't do it I think they say don't show it don't show it don't show it because I knew Junt is on that program right he's on those networks right he's got a huge show on that network he hunts in his fucking yard I mean he's not he's not a big piece of property I think he's less than 300 acres or maybe 300 acres that's not that much and in that 300 acres it's all high fenced he's got the African animals he's got all kinds of shit in there white tails pigs all in this one area and he hunts high fence almost exclusively and when he's hunting on it you know it says like spirit wild ranch yeah that's his yard I mean he's essentially hunting his pets if you really want to look at it that way his house goes sits in his favorite tree Stan probably got a bunch of him all over his property but itself I don't feel there's anything wrong with that because my brother raises sheep right and when he goes out to get the Sheep he goes out with a 22 he's got your gated pasture he runs lambs when he goes out to get a lamb he gives a lot of the way eat someone for himself shoots the lamb on the 22 however he doesn't dress it up like he's hunting the Lambs out on his pasture like it's a wild animal he's gonna sneak up on no I mean he doesn't like put he doesn't like put a picture of him in his 22 on in a dead lamb on Facebook he's like heart you know I mean he's a hunter he's a very avid hunter and never once in his life I wish he was here because I'd like to ask him this question never once in his life has he confused the act of farming organic sheep with the act of hunting wild elk yeah it's not confusing to him no but is it confusing would you have a good hunting year like so far he got elk with his bow a national forest land he got an antelope with his bow yard and he would never be like oh and I got ten lambs in my yard yeah it's just so weird to me that I feel like we talked about this with dog turn to duck turn has to go out now and then and kill a cattle on his farm mm-hmm he doesn't like get like gussied up and camo and get like a bunch of pink accents and like put pink accents all over his gun and go like shoot the cows on his property right no I wouldn't shot my cow right he wouldn't make a TV show where he's like acting like he's hunting his cows but his fence is only you know 20 yards whereas Ted Nugent's fences 300 acres yeah I can't really speak to it I just go see it [Music]
