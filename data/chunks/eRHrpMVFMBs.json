the gyro can experience it's a matter of time right oh yeah yeah well my dad is hilarious eighty six and three-quarters and he sent me an email today and it said here's a link to an article about marijuana reform and he said oh it's going to be legal in my lifetime oh I was like he's right dad I said I hope you're right you know even if you have to live in over 20 years I would have never thought in 2013 it would still be illegal when I was a kid I would I thought it's a matter of time well I was on the board of normal for a while quite a while and I was with people who started normal in 1970 and 71 and thought it would be legal in a few years so that sort of temper is my sense of time to be with people who you know over 40 years ago thought it was only going to be a few years away that marijuana would be legal and fortunately they're still working to try to help bring that about do you lose enthusiasm sometimes when you see that it's still illegal after all this no it's the it's about it's a worthy like on a worthy opponent it's a worthy goal and so I think we just do what we want to do there's a times when I felt like I was so blocked that I needed to do something where I could actually see change and so I stopped work for a week and painted my house and that was great that's Ronnie oh that really must see Messi much it must get to feel like you're spinning your wheels sometimes well for years and we just spent four years with Health Canada trying to get an import export permit to bring in eight grams of MDMA and this is after Health Canada had approved the protocol and our IRB had to prove the protocol and the four years it took and they went through all these ridiculous things about the pharmacy had to have bulletproof glass it had to have all these alarm systems class yeah see people going to come in and steal your eight grams of acid for MDMA that was eight grams yet that would be in a safe and the safe had to be disguised in a wooden cabinet and the safe had to be bolted to the floor they were harder than the US it was ridiculous but but we eventually you know prevailed we just took every ridiculous thing and we did it I mean my policy is surrender you know that when there's certain kind of irrational things coming from people who are more powerful try to give it to them well that's probably why you're in the position that you're in your eyesight atar of this I'm willing to dialogue so forth yeah together yeah and then there's the legislation that is being passed right now in several states to start to try to stop to prohibit what these guys are doing my filming undercover so yeah I've seen that yeah and how is how is that flying how are they allowing people to do that because everyone is outraged when they see those videos even a meteor they watch those videos of people like I saw one of this abuse that was going on with these cows where this guy was like hitting a cow with a crowbar it's there so horrific yeah and again another thing is being exposed by technology yeah I believe that that video could have very well come from the guy that we feature he's sort of the main one of them the biggest undercover animal rights activists said you alter his voice and Blair out his face you know they're his voice but we definitely you know it has he was in disguise actually good news he has he's had I don't know how many name changes throughout his wife and this he's been doing it he's really are yours in peace sort of if you ever want to do any undercover filming this is the guy you need to talk to and he actually gave me some training because of what all of this show is about undercover filming he gave me some training into filming undercover he sent me out into a parking lot and told me that first I had to go to that woman over there she's perfect stranger and you have to ask her you have to get the information from her I want to know where she lived before she lived here and I had to go and do that and I passed that really easily but then the second test that he made me do was I had to go out there and make a woman sort of run away from me because she was scared and I'm not very good at that I'm good at getting information from people but I can't it's not in my nature to be mean or area intimidating and so I went to a stocking lot and I just started acting wild crazy and not really scary just crazy right where is water where can I find some water but people were just staring what's this crazy woman probably thinking I was on bath salts or something why would why were they trying to get you to do all these two baby so this is part of the training is that you have to be able to make people feel either very comfortable with you so they give you information that you need that you want to get for your for your undercover filming or very uncomfortable with you so that you feel the need to either leave so you can film or or intimidating to a point intimidated to a point that you will release any information you give without actually resorting to violence obviously so this really it was really an interesting little practice that we had with him it's an amazing how much people identify with the genitals because there's a thing that women hate more than it not want more than anything is left and this massive generalization that has taught myself but there's one thing that a lot of women really do not appreciate and that's stinky pussy jokes you know you could talk about your stinky feet you can talk about a girl stinky feet and talk about a girl's breath you can talk about our girls but you can't talk about a girl stinky pussy like them to them you can't there's a lot of people that don't like me to talk about even on stage really like yes yes yes I've seen someone do a stinky pussy joke and I've seen women the audience going oh come on just upset that you put that possibility out there I've never smelt a bad fucking pussy like people let's get a lot of coke no no he knows is right now bro like I'm a fucking against them if I pick up a check out the barn she's dirty I'm think I made that take take a shower it's not gonna help I don't know yes it will won't help us a yeast infection no no but I got your Wilcox anger bang the girl my idaho falls indian or an American Indian I figure she had those daisy dukes not only one triple one night is and I'm all horned up though I like $32 I got no blow picking Budweiser fucking furious I'm dancing and she let me touch rolls Joe Rogan I stick my hand and like this way like forefinger Lou oh my god i fucking twat and I had that fucking young man look at the size of his head and I was bringing her this way you know Bruce Lee though I was broken nothing much you are alike makiwara stop I took it out all right tom I could I was dancing with it I could smell my hand oh no and that was it I've met my little do so that's a bonus and you can get it off you know that the smell of fish is actually from old come usually so if it's a really strong fish smell that means there's cum inside of her that's funny because that's what my balls always smell like an fight jerk off and don't wipe up smells like fish this is smelling so I realize I'm pathetic I used to cheat ladies it was about my own jizz I shoot sheet of my pubes and pull my underwear up by the way I've done that dozens of times in my life too we're just once I shoot of I jerk off I just shoot a load on my pubes I don't even bother cleaning it up I just pull my underwear up I do this special time in the house I'm like Lars it's covered we give a fuck if I'm the whole time by myself up I wonder what I don't cares who cares back when I'm the bed and laid on it I don't give a fuck but all day it's a lot about it this is my little tropical helmet juice but you're a fucking human being
