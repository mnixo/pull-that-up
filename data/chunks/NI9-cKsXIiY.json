the girag an experience that's the one thing comics left to do we love being children Don Barron's dombarris is like the king of that let's talk him last night about you he loves you to death and he's like she's bringing up how he used to did he used to go on the road with you or did oh I would have gone I would put on him whatever I was in I would put him in like we wound up doing this this crazy Frank Stallone movie in Ixtapa you know Mexico and we were stuck there for like five weeks and of course I'm a I'm a Don do like Alfred Hitchcock in the movie there was no call for Alfred Hitchcock but I took the producers into it you know and that's where he actually hurt hurt his foot you know how he's got like a bad foot yeah he hurt his foot well what happened with Don he always wants to fight me you know so so one day you know he starts in with me on the set and it's all these Mexican crew members that don't even understand English and he puts his foot like there was a hole in the ground and he wouldn't got at a hospital after to fix it you know so to this day like he just moves the wrong way and he's crippled you know he just falls down and and it was funny what happened was I went back to a Madison Square Garden in 2000 and it was Don's job at the time to come there cuz he really wanted to see it with my wife and my sons so he was the problem on the plane because what happened was he's walking down an aisle and the foot goes and he you know Don's emotional you know so he's screaming laying on the floor in the plane scaring scaring the entire flight you know and then they get him into a chair and the foot felt better you know so if the cops were at the airport to question him and I go your job was to just bring them here that was the gift you get to fly for nothing and get a hotel room bring them in and you caused a problem on the fucking airline but that's done you know that's who he is do you think he was just practical joking with you know he was know at Norm's no no no it really goes his foot really goes is it a broken foot is it a litter I'm sure he like chip something in his ankle and then he just went got a hottie goes what are they gonna do to me you know he turns into this baby you know oh yeah and he would do the road with me you know and I had when he would do the road with I would just take him with me when he would do the road I had a at that time I had Eddie Griffin with me I had yeah so Eddie Griffin was like the real opener you know and so what would happen is I'd give dawn 10 minutes right up front so we'd be on a big you know tour bus traveling the country and one time he's on the bus and he's like you know how he gets down on himself mm-hmm you know like you almost like that he's not crying with tears but I'm gonna what dong it's because the crowd doesn't respond the way he wants you know right because he would come out singing uh tie a yellow ribbon you know you know with the with the music over it and get the crowd clapping and so now the song ends and then he goes into another one we'll go into like Copacabana so now he's on the bus complaining about I got on it's your ten minutes after they get the joke of who you are that you're this fuckin goofball well now where were the jokes you know and he would go well you know I went into the other side I go they don't want to hear another you already did the big you had them clap now they gotta clap to Barry Manilow singing you know Copacabana who gives a fuck nobody gives a fuck you create the character you just fuckin big goofball and now give him jokes you know and but we had a lot of fun and then there would be another Rumble on the bus now it's him jumping on me and trying to kill me on the bus yeah he's his life is constant theater with that guy I'm stinky dice that's who I hang out with every single day from midnight to about 4:00 a.m. that's Paula and you know it was hysterical with the movie we did in Ixtapa they they wanted me to stay and film for longer than I wanted to be there you know and I'm going I got to get out of here I got eggs I gotta do so they promised me a lot of a lot of money you know in like cash and and done you know through the whole shoot is going they're never giving it to you you got to get it now I got done they're gonna pay me we made a deal that's it you know and you know and you know the it was a crazy set you know I mean I never went through anything like this in a film ever you know what went on in those five weeks and so he's gone you know through to five weeks I got to hear how they're not gonna pay me you know he's just on me that and of course they give me the money and Don had to tape it up you know all over my body like that movie Midnight Express did you willing yeah because you know it was a part of Mexico that we actually thought that the director was gonna have me stopped at the airport you know so you know we're thinking alright how am i got allowed more than like $10,000 in cash right was a lot of money you know so he was taping it with this like paper tape to my chest to my thigh you know that when I got home yeah and when we're going you know through the airport I'm going they're gonna stop me I'm gonna be in jail and whoever stops me he's gonna be rich you know it's that simple but they didn't stop us and now I get home and I take off my shirt and my wife sees all this money taped to my chest and she's going what is that you know no they paid me you know that's how they pay you in Mexico you know but Dom was just so sure they're not paying me for them it was just crazy it was a good I wouldn't eat we only had one meal a day cuz everybody on the set was getting sick you know everybody was going to the hospital and and all we had every day was we went to the same restaurant about four o'clock every day we had pasta with sauce garlic bread and coca-cola were purified ice and we wouldn't eat til the next day at the same time cuz we figured we'd make it the middle of the day because we're only getting that one meal we're not eating any of the food there Wow yeah and he lost like 30 pounds he's he's gone I gotta eat something this is ridiculous that we're not eating food you know but everybody's falling at the waist side what are we gonna do we got no dis is survival my friend what those be movie sets can be very fucking sketchy and it was for a long time yeah was he five weeks of the same food but I'm a king like I could do that I could eat the same thing every single day but you want it like twice a day but the restaurant would close like 9:00 at night so we'd have to wait till the next day at 4 o'clock to have the next meal Wow so what's just bottled water you know and that was it bottled water and pasta once a day what's the name of this movie it was called the good life it never came out ah you know and I always talked to Frank Stallone he always says he should release like pieces of it on the internet yeah it was the craziest thing you know I wanted it to be a comedy Frank Stallone wanted it to be a drama you know because because you know I would tell the producers I go you know it's really a funny movie you know in comedy cells right so when Frank would do a scene he'd come over to the director and go you know how was that and he goes well it was very dramatic you know and he's gone well it's supposed to be a drama and he goes well I think it should be funnier and he goes but the movies a fucking drama like so he was flipping out it we had a big fight over that movie but uh but the producers now wanted to just be like a comedy dennis hopper's in it it was supposed to be you know it was supposed to be it was supposed to be Goodfellas on a golf course so Dennis Hopper you and it's Hopper was in well but it was filming really can you find it anywhere no it's on its be but it doesn't yeah it's not online but no one put it online but David Carradine was in it too yeah a lot of people were innocently D'Angelo Wester Stallone is in it yes that's hilarious he never made it you never know that shit to Netflix or something like that you make it it's well it's not my movie to sell but you know it just wound up the whole time in Ixtapa was drama you know but it the movie hysterical you know there's just movie sets I've only been on one I've been on well to be movie sir but you know what happened we had a good director at the beginning and then the producer who was an attorney fired the director and he decided to direct no so now what happens is this is where it starts going a little crazy and I don't you know I can't play golf I hate fucking golf I I don't have patience to hit a one little ball you know of course the park whatever you know so I wasn't really good at playing the golf you know so we would make it that they make fun at me but I had some like golf material at the time where I talked about hating golf so the the this new director makes me do some of that material on like the master shot like on a crane so he goes I want you to do that monologue every time you know and I go no but I'm not doing that monologue every time I did it for you cuz you asked me to do it in the master shot just so you hear some talking and it goes no I want you to do it I go that's my material for my act I don't want to do it you know you're not paying me for it all yeah right and he goes you'll do what I say no I'm not gonna do a fucking thing you say I go and don't ever tell me what to do again ever in front of the camera which dombarris is falling down laughing as he's making our little documentary movie with my camera because I was always filming he did he literally say you'll do as I say yeah who ever lived and he and he says if you don't like it you could leave so I said okay I'll leave I go done let's go and I had Calypso to Kenny there I go let's see he goes well my attorneys will be into I go asshole you told me to leave the set you don't want me in the movie if I don't want to do my own material and I don't want to do it so don't fucking tell me what to do and I'll stay and that's it you know and what Don loved is no matter what the guy did you know for his main profession he goes you're telling your director the guy that's supposed to tell you what to do don't ever tell me what to do again but that's his only job right now is telling you what to do I go yeah but you heard what when it went down you know and he agreed with it and then I decided to direct part of the special it's but not the special of the movie and because I come to the set one day and it's like 110 degrees and this guy you know the guy directing was you know he had a funny character he was very low-key where the the sombrero cuz it was Mexico and it was always hot and I go what are we doing today and he goes I don't know you know and I go do you want me to set the shot up and he goes would you please this is the director now you know just he's just tapped out yeah he goes I just want to finish the movie and go home and they tell he would talk that's like an impression of the guy so now I'm directing I'm directing the movie and that was a scene I direct that this was great because I was like a little at war with Frank Stallone it the time on the set so I was shooting a scene that I needed on Barris for and now I decided to club soda Kenny will be in the movie also you know so Frank is shooting a scene where he's like playing a guitar in his underwear talking to some girl he was with in bed the night before so I come in there and I take the sound guys I'm like just come with me so now I get the sound guys so he winds up shooting the soul scene that he's doing and he doesn't know he doesn't have sound and all of a sudden coming from this house you hear him screaming he took the fucking sound guys you made me do all these takes and we don't even have fucking sound and the directors going well dice is directing a scene right now you know and he goes why the fuck is he directing anything it's not his movie to direct I mean people were having and then we crashed the golf carts which I got in trouble for I played chicken with the you know Peter Dobson he's an actor no he's been in a lot of stuff anyway so me and Dobson were good friends and decide to play chicken with the golf carts and I turn at the last second and my golf cart gets completely destroyed and Frank goes flying out of it because he's with me going what are you doing as we're going towards each other and I'm going just stick with me on this he goes I don't want to stick with you stop driving you know but we wouldn't stop driving and I turn and they smash Am I so now I'm not allowed to even lay off caught chicken yeah chicken to see who turns first you know and then we're having sword fights with the golf clubs I mean it was ridiculous what was going on your Beverly D'Angelo's in the movie Frank pecheurs in the movie was your war with Frank Stallone was just that I believe the movie should be a comedy you know so I started doing like an impression of him on screen but because I could do him really well the way he stands and you know so now he sees the final cut and he goes what are you doing behind me you know I go an impression of you because you're not supposed to be doing an impression to me I'm the leader of the gang I go but it's funny and he goes but the movies not funny you know and of course we all made up after him you know movie you know never came out you know make up with everybody make up with Paul you made up with that guy yeah because it's more fun to have your friends are you gonna make em laugh about it
