hello freak bitches I've been baking bread lately holy shit sourdough bread sourdough bread it's very good for you it is has gluten though yeah natural process yeah but sourdough bread apparently has way less gluten than regular bread right yeah because my wife can eat that mechanic the other bread really it's a cool thing it just takes the you just take flour and water you need a starter which is culture oh yeah yeah you just start with flour and water and then the natural yeast that comes from around us in the environment goes in and starts eating that what and it becomes a living thing and people have starters that are like a hundred years old Black's you take it you take a couple ounces off and you always maintain a little unfit it like a living thing it's like a bowl of flour and water but it's you'll see it start to bubble when you feed it more flour in water Wow he's deceiving yeah it's the coolest that's crazy so it's in your refrigerator like my fridge like a little little a mason jar and then you scoop it out you just take a little chunk of it and they feed it and it expands and then you take some of that and make bread out of it that is fucking nuts it's pretty yeah I never would have been into this if I didn't hear that concept and now I can't stop I'm baking bread like Little Red Riding Hood who gave me the idea to do this this writer friend of mine he's been doing it for a long time and he said it's just you just have sourdough bread and the kids love it and Wow I just started doing it and I just got hooked on it where do you buy your starter you don't buy it you can just start it make a starter make a starter okay how do you do that you just take some flour and water and put it out on the on the counter that's it yeah I mean there's measurements and stuff but that's it and then the natural yeast there's yeast around us just floating around that explains a lot of things yeah and it goes into it goes into the into the concoction and you'll see it starts to bubble and get lighter and you feed it some more and it gets bigger why say feed it like because it's leading it it's like a yeast right a little like little community right feeding it you evil parts flour and water Wow and it eats it and now it's like this living thing in the house who has a starter that's 100 years old I went to buy a Dutch oven which is like a pot that you can bake like we put the bread in and this old guy was like what are you doing give it a guy once and I was like 6 foot blanky what do you need it for I'm like I'm gonna make some bread oh I've been making bread for a long time really I'm gonna be making sourdough bread oh I got my starter were you getting your starter so well friend of mine has the Brea starter and my daughter willow the what LaBrea what's the La Brea starter that one is that all the Brea LaBrea bakery bread you get the yeast off of the skin of grapes so there's a process where you take grapes and you put it in like cheesecloth and you just let the the yeast come off of all all grapes have yeast in the skin eating on the skin of the grapes and it drips off and then you put it into the basic started with the flour and water so as you say a little sweeter great it's a chain yeah like labret yeah there's you'll see them okay there are actual bakery and now they're like in Ralph's and everything that's all over and they say and like the places of San Francisco that have big sour dough yeah that it all it maintains the same starter that they've always had so this guy said so I told him where I was getting my stuff my daughter made one as a gift and then this other guy gave me a piece he said his starter came from Jackson Hole Wyoming and he got it from a friend of his and it's over a hundred years old what people have been passing it on it's a cowboy starter cowboy starter that's what it was it was a lot of miners in San Francisco and all that during the gold rush they were creating bread that way that's where it started no huh yeah I wonder how old the yeast organisms will get before they die and do they die they probably reproduce and yeah it's a good question I don't know because basically like I have it on my counter now been feeding it for the last day so now so now it's kind of bubbly Wow looks like glue it's kind of bubbly so I'll scoop out four ounces of that make bread out of it and then take one ounce of that put it back in the jar feed it a little and put it in the fridge so what's the process so if you took four ounces out and made bread with it what do you do with that the starter you basically take a lot of flour you take like 28 this is to make two of them two loaves you take 28 ounces of all-purpose flour or wheat flour whatever you want to use you put that in with a little salt then you take your starter you take the four ounces and 18 ounces of water a bunch of water and you make it into a cloudy mixture and then you dump that into the flour and salt that's in your mixer and it just makes it into dough and then it just rises naturally fold it a couple times put it into a ball into the Dutch oven after a couple hours and then you've got bread it's that simple it's that simple how long before you start growing your own wheat and smashing up with a rock headed that way that is the guy who taught the Dutch oven from is like I really like seed breads that's like crazy like 12 different seeds from different places and you mash them up I mean then then you're getting a job at williams-sonoma I went to the Museum of Natural History and they have an Egyptian mummy display really fucking cool yeah but one of the interesting things was by the time Egyptian people were older you know they didn't leave that lived that long but if they did they didn't have any teeth left because the way they made bread they ground it up they ground up their own flour and it left sand in the bread oh yeah so their bread was all you're eating sand wear away your teeth that's great I thought you're gonna say sugar no sand oh no works where your teeth down line the down Irv's and they had all these methods that they were trying to concoct to save teeth like wooden caps that they would put on chew on that instead of chewing with whatever nerve endings were left in your face just so you could eat more Sam bread Sandy bread it's fuck it is a kind of a trippy thing that you just put some flour and water and this yeast comes from the environment and now you've got this amazing tasting bread that the family can't stop eating the kids right in it it's just its premise has been around forever right out of the oven when it's hot yeah uh we're eating bread like crazy like we're talking about like eating sugar and all that flat we just can't stop Wow we're all gonna be fine I'm going the other way I'm not eatin any of it at least for 60 days I'm gonna I don't feel like C days I don't feel mentally that clear making some life choices big regret I told you I woke up at 7:00 this morning like oh I got to do a show tonight yeah so weird that you could just like put it out there and the natural yeast grows I'd yeah yeah no idea I felt like you you know what I wish someone had asked me where does yeast come from because I never considered it before I would have been like a fucking what is it a plant what is I don't know and then there's like you know because you can buy yeast that just make regular bread and you throw it in there and it eats Wow woman maintains a hundred and twenty two-year-old sourdough starter yeah look at that whoa there was a woman online who is this radical feminist who made sourdough bread out of her pussy east yeah go find that when the kids couldn't keep their hands off of it Oh fucking flying off the shelves yeah I tweeted about it but it was quite a while ago probably never find it but I was like good for her there is I can't tell you it's really a weird thing I mean who haven't never be bacon bread oh now I'm like hooked on it yeah there is a woman who made sourdough bread using yeast from her vagina just ate the bread wouldn't she you know so gross when I eat it but when my wife swallows it it's all gravy that's a good relationship tell me to commit its how life is built yeah it's a compromise yeah so I'm baking bread and getting fat breads good what's that breads good it's not it's not good for you Tom Papa I know we started resurgence oh you brought bread you son of a bitch it's old and it's wrapped in a cloth ladies and gentlemen look like like he's some old timey Baker feel like the only thing I'm bummed about is I didn't have a basket to break it did you make that I made this is a sourdough this is a sourdough bread from Tom Papa that made it into New York Times yeah when I did your show and custom Ellen talked about it yeah this is a couple days old cuz I thought I was coming a couple days ago did you even make the top a little flowery like like a real baked really miss well it's good god that smells good yeah that's ancient sourdough Tom Papa you fucking animal you brought a knife and everything well it looks like we're off the diet today today I was at the lowest weight I've been in like years oh really 190 this morning oh really yeah it's crazy how tall are you 5 8 wow I really uh I don't think that this bread this is sourdough bread you digest as a lower glycemic supposedly it's possibly allegedly I'm in though dude just slice it up and I got it on there yeah yeah it's nice this is a couple days old scratch this this table would actually be good like it'll make it cooler so you just cut it like it's a cutting board don't be shy all right this is uh I mean this is how bread was made originally this in ancient Egypt 6,000 years ago ancient Egypt do you know that in ancient Egypt when they made bread they ground their flour on like mortar and pestle but they were really shitty and so they'd get a lot of sand in the flour so the people in ancient Egypt all had fucked up teeth like worn down to the nerves because they were chewing sand all day so the inside of their body was like a fucking River those things called on birds what does that call like a thing that thing that they do the crop where your your gizzard yeah you have your your fucking rocks in there and you chew up your food which is apparently one of the reasons why they made lead shot illegal in California because like if people do like shooting clays or if they shoot things and those little lead pellets from shotguns right birds will actually eat those and it goes in there there their gizzard and they use it to to grind things up but then they get lead poisoning that's the thing with the California condor oh really yeah that's one of the reasons why California condors one of the reasons why they made lead illegal for ammunition in California was because of California condors because they were tiered dump fucks so eating pellets you know that's not a rock you stupid fuck Condor they look dumb they have dumbest father they really do but we need them this shit I mean toast it would really be the thing that would get you some time right now folks here we go so happy to see you eat bread this has a good it's pretty good I was a nice and airy mm-hmm I make the eye we haven't bought bread since I started this how long it was up December Wow we have not bought bread do you know like bread in in your supermarket this is made with three ingredients this is flour water and salt it lets you know from your sourdough starter bread like the healthy like whole wheat bread you get at Ralph's or whatever 32 ingredients 32 is pure and is that just because it's preserved preservatives and flavors and yeah people just so mad when you eat on a microphone I know but it's so good normally folks I would never do this to you and I'm only doing this to you because Tom Papa brought some bread in and I'm gonna break my diet for a few hours the sourdough flavor like that little after flavor on the top of your mouth that's it that's a bacteria that's lactobacillus or something like that no yeah dude this is really good you're an excellent bread guy it's pretty Seoul stand up comedy thing doesn't pan out dude I'm gonna just go into it after doing your podcast and then talking about it on my podcast it just kind of erupted people were just so interested in just this pure making something small and simple and mm-hmm and I think I told you when I saw you at the Comedy Store there's there's like you know you have some you some real man listeners like dudes who look like they're gonna call you for like advice on a truck and they're like I can't get my starter right there's some like people would start sending me pictures of there's bread and pictures of their sourdough and then this guy from the New York Times Sam sift and the editor was doing an article on it so he contacted me and I was part of this sourdough the this whole thing about people keep their sourdough starter like a pet so it was kind of like this revival of this little method so I ended up in this article with them in the New York Times yeah read it I had a lot of people send me articles about starters - yeah like people in England that have 150 year old starters on this crazy shit weird it's so good I'd never even heard about until you brought it up I know no idea I had no idea there until a month before that I had the I was under the impression and it was with zero research just my head this is how you make bread mm-hmm I thought you take flour and water and eggs and yeast yeah you add yeast poor yeast and that's all I thought I didn't I never knew that you had like they could take flour and mix it with water and then you get yeast out of the air yeah when you told me that I was like yeah fuck out here that's crazy just floating around this all the time did you know that's what the case with nitrogen mm-hmm yeah like the reason one there's so many people on this planet and this is from a radio Lab podcast that highlighted I think it was called the bad show but the the radio lab podcast was highlighting how sometimes really bad people do really good things or really good it sometimes it's difficult to differentiate between someone who's bad or good because what they've done is so amazing right well this guy named Fritz Haber and Fritz Haber was a scientist in Germany and what Habra did was he figured out a way to extract nitrogen from the air because apparently our air is mostly nitrogen it's a
