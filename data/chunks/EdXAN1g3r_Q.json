hello freak bitches rat scared the fuck out of me we've talked about on the podcast before I had a bad situation with a rat once at a pool hall in New Jersey me and my friend John went to this place to play pool and there's this fucking huge rat this big giant fucking crazy yellow teeth and you think about is like getting bitten by the rat I have a great rat story and I so back back in the dizzy no let me this is one that's pretty dark so like you know whatever move let me let me paint this might own parts dark dark so I used to work in retail in this story yeah let's call it rats blood okay it's actually really loud so I was working in retail and it was a horrible job it was like totally degrading as a human and all you would do is fold clothes all day it was really expensive and these people would come in and spend ridiculous amounts of money on clothes and they were just shitty and mean and rude and rich whatever not that that all constitutes but it was just an unpleasant experience right and from whether it was a customer or the staff that you know my employers were just not kind and they didn't give a shit about you so I was already I knew I was kind of walking on thin ice cuz I I wasn't like enthusiastic about being there was just a job and one day before the biggest sale of the year where people like late ladies freaked out I came into the store and that weekend there had been like there had been indications and evidence that there were rodents because and I you know what I knew or it were wrath because I could smell them I swear to God I could smell me literally when someone says I can smell a rat there's a musty smell to them you can fucking smell them I never said oh it's totally because my first house in LA I moved into off of a Craigslist ad had rats and I knew I was like that smell I I know that smell that was from my old house that's a rat so long story short the exterminators come in and set traps the night before so Saturday morning when like this big sale starts every all the girls were like oh my god they call it something I don't know we walk into the store and there's like there's one dead rat upstairs there's one in the traps downstairs and another one downstairs and then there was another there was a trap that had been deployed and there was a piece of a big large piece of a tail and blood I'm talking blood all over the clothes all over the wall but no rat and one of the girls had walked into the front of the of the store and also you should know there was a line forming outside of people that wanted to get in to get this end of the Year sale one of the girls walks in she goes oh what's that and it was the size of a cat and it was the rat that got that got out of the trap that like lost its tail was in the middle of the store bleeding and it was like this big everybody's freaking out one of the girls was ballsy enough to throw a trash can over it so it's like you know it's like screaming in this Oh at this point it's time it is time to to open the store and all that people are knocking on the window and we were able to like we were able to sort of create a diversion and put some clothes rack so you couldn't see the trash can they had people in with the window nobody was letting I mean this was like it was screaming like you couldn't no one oh it gets so much better the exterminator comes back we're like dude there's a fucking live rat in the store we can't open the doors we have a sale there's a line around the block like you know the owner everybody's on the phone everybody's freaking out exterminator shows up and he he walks in he's like oh yeah that's a that's a problem and he's like wow I don't have my pellet gun so and the next thing I know he walks out to his truck and he comes back with a 2x4 and he's like like you ladies might want to step back kicks the trash can open and just fucking splat like blow up watermelon in the middle of the story so then oh we get so much better so after he kills the rat and it's like guts and entrails are all over the place the mat store manager is like ladies we need to clean this up and open the store I was like are you fucking serious so like buckets of bleach and like whatever clothing has the blood on it just take it out well you know we'll cancel it out later so we're cleaning we're running around and I'm not kidding you the doors open five minutes and the manager who's my age calls me upstairs and she's like Suzanne um came aboard with you and I'm like yeah yeah sure whatever go upstairs I get fucking fired she was like look you know we've been wanting to talk to you about you know your performance here and like I don't feel I know that you want to be a musician just want to be but anyway I was like you couldn't fire me before you made me clean up the rats blood I had to clean up the blood and then get fired are you fucking kidding me like it was one of those moments where I literally I lost my shit did you tell them that she was like what'd you do for the rest of the day if you want I was like you you think I want to say her and look at you I hate you horrible but it's such a good story so going through it it was all worth it at the time well it was just I never like I'd never experienced like any it's such a fantastical story that's a very good story it's crazy isn't it funny how a story that is absolutely horrible at the time becomes awesome oh yeah it was a low point though cuz it was so insult like when someone in in like dig like just degrades you like that like she said I know you're trying to be a musician but like your hearts on it and I was like of course I know it's not intelligent rats or two-by-fours you need to examine priorities
